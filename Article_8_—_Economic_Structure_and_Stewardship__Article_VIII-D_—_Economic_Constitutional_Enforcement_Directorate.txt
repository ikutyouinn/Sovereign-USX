Article VIII-D — Economic Constitutional Enforcement Directorate
 Charge
Economic liberty cannot be preserved where constitutional prohibitions exist only on paper.
Predatory extraction, systemic exploitation, and oligarchic consolidation succeed not because they are lawful, but because they are complex, concealed, and under-enforced. Where enforcement is episodic, under-resourced, or politically dependent, constitutional economic safeguards decay into symbolism.
This Article establishes a narrow, judicially subordinated Economic Constitutional Enforcement Directorate to investigate, document, and prosecute violations of Articles VIII, VIII-A, VIII-B, and VIII-C, while denying it all authority to regulate, legislate, punish, negotiate, or define economic policy.
⸻
Section 1. Establishment and Judicial Subordination (Lock-Protected)
There is hereby established the Economic Constitutional Enforcement Directorate (“the Directorate”) as an investigative and prosecutorial arm solely subordinated to the Constitutional Judicial Commission (CJC).
The Directorate shall not be part of the Executive Branch, shall possess no independent executive or regulatory authority, and may not be merged with, absorbed by, or subordinated to any executive agency, department, ministry, or office. Any attempt to do so is void ab initio.
⸻
Section 2. Strict Subject-Matter Jurisdiction (Lock-Protected)
The Directorate’s jurisdiction is limited exclusively to alleged violations of: • Article VIII — Economic Structure and Stewardship; • Article VIII-A — Supplemental Economic Doctrines and Safeguards; • Article VIII-B — Prohibition of Predatory Economic Practices; • Article VIII-C — Systemic Confidence Exploitation.
The Directorate shall prioritize systemic, patterned, or large-scale conduct reasonably foreseeable to produce widespread economic harm, institutional capture, or parasitic wealth extraction.
The Directorate possesses no authority over ordinary commercial disputes, contract interpretation absent constitutional violation, lawful business failure, labor relations not rising to constitutional violation, taxation, rate-setting, price controls, or any matter outside the enumerated Articles.
⸻
Section 3. Investigative Powers and Absolute Prohibitions (Lock-Protected)
(a) Permitted Powers
Subject to judicial warrant where required, the Directorate may: 1. conduct forensic accounting, financial analysis, and pattern-based investigations; 2. issue subpoenas for records, testimony, and data; 3. compel production of documents, transactional histories, and control relationships; 4. investigate successor entities, affiliates, shells, proxies, and control structures; 5. assemble evidentiary records for referral to prosecution.
(b) Absolute Prohibitions
The Directorate shall have no authority to: 1. issue regulations, guidance, interpretive rules, or policy directives; 2. define lawful or unlawful economic conduct beyond constitutional text; 3. impose fines, penalties, sanctions, or remedies; 4. negotiate settlements, grant immunity, safe harbors, or exemptions absent court approval; 5. suspend enforcement for policy, political, economic, or emergency reasons; 6. act as an independent prosecutor; all cases must be referred to the CJC or authorized courts.
Any such prohibited act is void and constitutes a grave constitutional offense.
⸻
Section 4. Initiation of Investigations
Investigations may be initiated only by: (a) referral from the Constitutional Judicial Commission or Constitutional Review Court; (b) sworn public complaints or whistleblower submissions meeting evidentiary thresholds; (c) legislative request for systemic review of a defined industry or pattern; (d) pattern-based indicators derived from lawful public-records analysis.
The Directorate shall not self-initiate investigations absent CJC authorization.
Investigations shall be declined where motivated by political animus, ideological bias, lawful wealth accumulation, unpopular speech, or sectoral dislike.
All initiations shall be documented and subject to judicial review, with redaction permitted only for active investigative necessity.
⸻
Section 5. Prosecution and Judicial Remedies
The Directorate may refer cases only to the Constitutional Review Court or courts of general jurisdiction for prosecution.
All remedies shall be imposed by courts only and may include: • injunctive relief; • restitution and disgorgement; • clawback of unconstitutional gains; • dissolution or restructuring of offending entities; • prohibition on successor reconstitution; • referral for criminal prosecution where warranted.
The Directorate shall not decline prosecution based on entity size, economic importance, employment impact, market position, or claimed indispensability.
“No entity is too big to comply.”
⸻
Section 6. Transparency and Public Accountability (Lock-Protected)
All non-classified records of the Directorate constitute public records under Article XXXIX.
The Directorate shall publish quarterly reports detailing: (a) investigations initiated and declined, with reasons; (b) referrals made and actions filed; (c) remedies sought and imposed; (d) systemic or pattern-level findings.
Annual audits conducted by the CJC shall be public.
Secrecy shall not be used to conceal favoritism, delay accountability, or suppress evidence of constitutional economic harm.
⸻
Section 7. Personnel Independence and Anti-Capture
Personnel shall be selected based on demonstrated competence in law, economics, accounting, forensic investigation, or data analysis.
No person may serve who: 1. has been employed by, lobbied for, or materially invested in a regulated entity within the preceding seven (7) years; 2. holds partisan office or party leadership; 3. seeks future employment or compensation from entities subject to investigation.
A post-service cooling-off period of five (5) years shall apply before accepting compensation from any entity investigated or prosecuted during tenure.
Violations constitute grave constitutional offenses.
⸻
Section 8. Standing, Review, and Discipline
Any person subject to investigation has standing to challenge jurisdictional overreach, procedural abuse, or constitutional violation before the Constitutional Review Court.
Broad citizen standing is granted to challenge Directorate misconduct, abuse of authority, or unlawful non-enforcement.
Willful abuse, selective enforcement, or collusion with private interests constitutes grave constitutional misconduct subject to removal, liability, and permanent disqualification from public office.
⸻
Section 9. Construction and Lock Protection
This Article shall be construed strictly to enable enforcement of existing constitutional economic safeguards without creating new regulatory authority, investigative sprawl, or policy power.
Ambiguities shall be resolved against expansion.
Judicial subordination, strict jurisdictional limits, prohibitions on rulemaking and punishment, transparency obligations, and anti-capture safeguards are structurally locked pursuant to Article XV and may not be repealed, suspended, diluted, or reinterpreted except through the highest procedural threshold defined therein.
