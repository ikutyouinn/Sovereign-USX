Article 0-B — Constitutional Routing of Authority
Charge
This Article establishes the mandatory allocation of constitutional enforcement, integrity protection, and judicial review to ensure that no power center of the Republic may escape oversight through ambiguity, forum shopping, or emergency pretext.  All Articles of this Constitution shall be construed in harmony with this routing.
Section 1. Allocation of Core Functions
The constitutional organs of oversight are assigned exclusive and non-overlapping functions as follows:
Function
Assigned Body
Determination of constitutional meaning, legality, validity, and legal effect
Constitutional Review Court (CRC)
Protection against institutional capture, corruption, coercion, retaliation, concealment, and abuse of process
Constitutional Judicial Commission (CJC)
Final constitutional interpretation, precedent, and resolution of fundamental constitutional conflicts
Supreme Court of the Republic
Fact-finding, audits, and operational investigation
Inspectors, auditors, and specialized oversight bodies
No body may exercise a function assigned to another unless this Constitution expressly so provides.
Section 2. Mandatory Triggering Rules
Whenever any Article of this Constitution provides for:  - judicial authorization, - judicial review, - warrants, - injunctions, - nullification, - suspension of authority, - emergency powers, - secrecy, - dissolution, - loss of rights, or - institutional discipline,  the following routing shall apply unless expressly displaced:
(a) The Constitutional Review Court shall have original jurisdiction to determine constitutional compliance. (b) The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have concurrent authority to certify institutional abuse, capture, or concealment and to petition the Constitutional Review Court for relief. (c) The Supreme Court of the Republic shall have appellate or discretionary review over Constitutional Review Court determinations.
Section 3. Emergency and Secrecy Override Prohibition
No emergency, national security, continuity, or necessity doctrine may suspend, bypass, or reassign the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Review Court or the Constitutional Judicial Commission.  No secret tribunal, special court, or undisclosed adjudicatory body may exercise any function reserved to the Constitutional Review Court, the Constitutional Judicial Commission, or the Supreme Court of the Republic.
Section 4. Anti-Laundering Rule
No statutory court, tribunal, board, agency, or executive process may be used to:  - evade Constitutional Review Court constitutional review; - shield institutional misconduct from Constitutional Judicial Commission investigation; or - substitute administrative process for constitutional adjudication.  Any attempt to do so is void.
Section 5. Construction and Anti-Dilution Rule
This Article shall be construed to preserve:  - rapid constitutional enforcement; - slow and deliberative final review; and - constant protection against institutional capture.  No later Article may impliedly repeal, dilute, or reassign the routing established herein.
