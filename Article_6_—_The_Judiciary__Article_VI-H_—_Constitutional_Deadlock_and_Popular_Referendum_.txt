Article VI-H — Constitutional Deadlock and Popular Referendum

Section 1. Purpose and Extraordinary Nature

This Subarticle establishes a limited mechanism for resolving genuine constitutional deadlock where the ordinary processes of adjudication cannot yield a determinate outcome.

The popular referendum authorized by this Subarticle is extraordinary, subsidiary to judicial review, and shall not be employed as a routine instrument of governance.

Section 2. Definition of Constitutional Deadlock

A constitutional deadlock exists only where all of the following conditions are met:
	1.	a substantial question of constitutional interpretation is dispositive of a matter of national scope;
	2.	the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Review Court have rendered final decisions that are irreconcilably divided or incapable of producing a binding constitutional rule;
	3.	no further judicial remedy or clarification is available within the Judiciary;
	4.	continued uncertainty materially impairs the operation of the Republic or the equal application of constitutional rights.

Mere disagreement, dissent, delay, or political controversy shall not constitute deadlock.
For purposes of this Section, “incapable of producing a binding constitutional rule” includes: an evenly divided court; lack of quorum; recusal or vacancy preventing formation of a controlling rule; or fractured opinions lacking any controlling rationale. A mere difference of reasoning does not constitute deadlock where a binding constitutional rule exists.

⸻

Section 3. Exhaustion of Judicial Remedies

No popular referendum may be initiated unless all judicial remedies have been fully exhausted.

Judicial exhaustion requires:
	1.	final disposition by the Supreme Court; and
	2.	final constitutional determination by the Constitutional Review Court under Article VI-B, Section 7, including Supreme Court opportunity for review and mandatory review where the CRC certifies appellate consideration is required, where jurisdiction exists.

Failure to pursue available judicial remedies bars invocation of this Subarticle.

Nothing in this Section prohibits resolution of a certified constitutional deadlock pursuant to Article VI-H; pending such resolution, the default-to-liberty rule governs.

⸻

Section 4. Certification of Deadlock

A declaration of constitutional deadlock shall require certification by:
(1)	 a supermajority of the Constitutional Review Court; and
(2) concurrence by a supermajority of the Supreme Court,
 that the criteria of Section 2 have been satisfied; and, 
(3) certification by the Constitutional Judicial Commission that no party, judge, or institution has engaged in coercion, capture, corruption, or strategic obstruction designed to manufacture or prolong the deadlock.

Absent such certification, no referendum may proceed.
“Supermajority” shall have the meaning given in Article 0 (Supermajority Rule) unless this Subarticle expressly provides otherwise.

⸻

Section 5. Scope and Form of Referendum

A referendum under this Subarticle shall be limited strictly to the constitutional question certified as deadlocked.

The question presented shall:
	1.	be stated neutrally and precisely;
	2.	present no more than two constitutionally permissible alternatives;
	3.	avoid partisan framing, legislative detail, or policy embellishment.

The referendum shall not amend this Constitution unless the amendment procedures of Article XV are separately satisfied.

⸻

Section 6. Effect of Referendum Outcome

The outcome of a referendum conducted pursuant to this Subarticle shall:

	1.	resolve the certified constitutional question;
	2.	bind all branches of government;
	3.	be applied prospectively unless otherwise required to prevent manifest injustice.

The referendum outcome shall not:
	1.	diminish enumerated rights;
	2.	suspend judicial review in future cases;
	3.	authorize retroactive punishment.

Threshold:
The certified constitutional question shall be resolved only upon a supermajority vote of participating Civic Citizens, as defined in Article 0, unless this Constitution expressly requires a higher threshold.

⸻

Section 7. Judicial Review of Process

Courts shall retain jurisdiction to review:
	1.	compliance with the requirements of this Subarticle;
	2.	the neutrality and clarity of the referendum question;
	3.	the integrity of the referendum process.

Courts shall not review the substantive choice made by the People where the process complies with this Constitution.

⸻

Section 8. Prohibitions and Safeguards

No referendum under this Subarticle may be used to:
	1.	target specific persons or groups;
	2.	override a final acquittal;
	3.	suspend due process;
	4.	evade constitutional rights;
	5.	resolve ordinary policy disputes.

Emergency, necessity, or expediency shall not justify deviation from these safeguards.

⸻

Section 9. Frequency and Non-Repetition

No substantially similar constitutional question may be submitted to referendum more than once within a defined period as provided by law, absent materially changed circumstances.

Rolling or repetitive referenda designed to exhaust or coerce the People are prohibited.

⸻

Section 10. Relationship to Other Articles

This Subarticle operates subject to Article XV.

Nothing herein shall be construed to diminish the authority of the Judiciary under Article VI, nor the rights secured by Article XXVI.

Election administration related to referenda shall comply with Article XVI.

⸻

Section 11. Interpretation

This Subarticle shall be interpreted narrowly, to preserve judicial independence while recognizing that ultimate constitutional sovereignty resides in the People.

Where doubt exists, the construction that favors judicial resolution over popular referendum shall control.

⸻

[LOCK DESIGNATION]

The following principles of this Subarticle are designated for lock protection and shall not be abridged except by explicit constitutional revision:
	1.	exhaustion of judicial remedies as a prerequisite;
	2.	dual-court certification of deadlock;
	3.	narrow scope and neutral framing of referendum questions;
	4.	prohibition on rights diminution or retroactive punishment;
	5.	judicial review of process integrity.
