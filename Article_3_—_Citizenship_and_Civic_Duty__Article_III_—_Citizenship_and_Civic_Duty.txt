Article III — Citizenship and Civic Duty

Charge
This Article defines the conditions under which political authority, suffrage, and eligibility for public office are granted within the Republic.

It establishes Civic Citizenship as a constitutional office of trust, earned through lawful service, competence, and allegiance to the constitutional order, and it distinguishes political authority from personhood, dignity, and civil rights.

The purpose of this Article is to ensure that those who govern the Republic have demonstrated sacrifice, responsibility, and accountability to the People, while guaranteeing equal civil rights and human dignity to all lawful residents.
Legal Text

Section 1. Definitions, Age of Majority, and Service Eligibility

(a) Age of Adulthood
The age of adulthood shall be twenty-one (21).

(b) Minimum Age to Begin Service
No qualifying service toward civic citizenship may begin before eighteen (18) years of age.

(c) Practical Minimum Age for Completion
Because service may not begin before eighteen (18), and the shortest qualifying term is two (2) years, completion before twenty-one (21) shall be rare or impracticable except where specifically authorized by law without undermining the purpose of this Article.

(d) Classes of Persons
This Constitution recognizes: lawful residents, non-civic residents, civic citizens (full citizens), and unlawful entrants. Political rights attach only to civic citizens except as expressly stated.
(e) Exclusivity of Status

No person shall be assigned to any legal or political status other than those listed in subsection (d).
No agency, court, or statute may create intermediate, hybrid, provisional, or alternative classes of political personhood.
(f) Protection of Minors
No labor, training, volunteer work, apprenticeship, military program, or institutional participation undertaken before eighteen (18) years of age may be credited toward civic citizenship or political eligibility.
(g) Political Authority Reserved
No voting right, office-holding right, initiative power, or binding political authority may be exercised by any person other than a civic citizen unless expressly authorized by this Constitution.
Administrative or advisory participation shall not be construed as political power.

Section 2. Civil Rights for All Lawful Residents

All persons lawfully residing within the Republic shall enjoy inalienable rights as expressed in this Constitution, regardless of citizenship status, including: freedom of speech, thought, conscience, religion, and assembly; protection from arbitrary search, seizure, or deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process; the right to fair trial, legal representation, and equal protection under law; freedom of movement, occupation, contract, and private property ownership; and access to emergency medical care, basic education for minors, and public safety services. These rights shall not be abridged except where necessary to protect the rights of others, or as otherwise authorized under strict due process.

Voting and officeholding are reserved to civic citizens. Rights may be denied or restricted only for unlawful entrants or invasive forces as defined by law consistent with due process, for heinous criminals under lawful conviction, and for individuals who demonstrate a persistent criminal nature with no apparent ability to rehabilitate as determined through transparent judicial proceedings.
Political Trust Clarification
Civic Citizenship constitutes a political trust and office of governance, not a classification of personhood, civil worth, or human dignity.

All persons retain equal protection of law and inviolable rights regardless of civic status. Differences in political authority reflect qualifications for governance, not hierarchy of humanity.

(a) Standard of Restriction

No right listed in this Section may be limited or burdened except by:
1. individualized judicial order,
2. based on clear and convincing evidence,
3. of imminent and specific harm,
4. and using the least restrictive means.

Generalized public safety, administrative convenience, or group status shall not suffice.

(b) Prohibition on Collective or Status-Based Deprivation

No lawful resident shall lose or have diminished civil rights on the basis of citizenship status, immigration category, economic condition, race, belief, or political view.
Only individualized criminal conviction or judicial incapacity may justify restriction.

(c) Determination of Dangerousness

Any finding of persistent criminality or irredeemable danger shall comply fully with Article II, including due process, evidence standards, right to counsel, and periodic review.



Section 3. Non-Civic Residents and Political Disability

(a) Non-Civic Status
Non-civic residents retain all fundamental liberties except the right to vote and the right to hold elected or appointed public office.

(b) Participation in Civil Society
Non-civic residents may participate in civil society, lawful associations, public discourse, and petitioning, and may pursue service pathways toward civic citizenship.
(c) No Exercise of Political Authority

No non-civic resident may exercise or control binding governmental power, including through:
1. regulatory bodies,
2. public–private partnerships,
3. advisory boards with decision authority,
4. state-funded NGOs,
5. or contractual delegation of governmental functions.
(d) Access to Service Pathways

No lawful non-civic resident shall be barred, delayed, or obstructed from pursuing lawful service pathways toward civic citizenship except by individualized judicial finding of disqualification.


Section 4. Pathways to Civic Citizenship

Full Civic Citizenship constitutes the highest political status within the Republic and shall be earned, not inherited, purchased, or conferred by discretion.

Full Civic Citizenship shall be conferred only upon individuals who satisfy the requirements governing Civic Citizenship as set forth in this Constitution and who, in addition, demonstrate a sustained record of sacrifice, responsibility, and commitment to the common good.

Pathways to Civic Citizenship shall include, but are not limited to, honorable and verified public service performed in furtherance of the Republic, including service in roles that expose the individual to danger, hardship, trauma, sustained labor, or material sacrifice on behalf of the public.

Such service may include military service, law enforcement, firefighting and emergency medical services, disaster response, public infrastructure maintenance, environmental restoration, or other equivalent roles demonstrating sustained responsibility and sacrifice, as defined and governed by this Constitution.

Responsible parenting, defined as the sustained raising of children to adulthood with moral formation, civic education, and lawful conduct, may qualify as equivalent service for one or both parents, subject to verification, non-discriminatory standards, and the requirements of Article XVIII governing civic formation.

Applicants for Civic Citizenship must also demonstrate competence and readiness for civic responsibility through objective evaluation, including completion of required training or certification, successful performance review where applicable, and passage of a non-partisan civics examination covering the Constitution, the history of the Republic, and the duties and limits of citizenship.

Applicants must swear the oath of loyalty prescribed by this Constitution, affirming allegiance to the Republic and its constitutional order and rejecting foreign allegiances or subversive loyalties incompatible with Civic Citizenship.

Applicants must meet age and residency requirements as prescribed by this Constitution and by law, consistent with the governing provisions on Civic Citizenship.

The requirements, standards, definitions, procedures, and legal effects governing Civic Citizenship are exhaustively defined in Section 4a of this Article, and no Civic Citizenship shall be conferred except in strict compliance therewith.

Civic Citizenship constitutes a political trust and qualification for governance, not a classification of personhood, civil worth, or human dignity, which are equal for all persons under this Constitution.

(a) Prohibition on Purchase or Preferment

No money, donation, investment, inheritance, sponsorship, political affiliation, or personal relationship shall confer, accelerate, or substitute for any requirement of Civic Citizenship.

(b) Verification and Public Record

All qualifying service shall be verified through public records, independent audits, and sworn documentation.
False, exaggerated, or proxy service shall permanently disqualify the applicant.

(c) Neutrality of Evaluation

No applicant shall be judged, favored, or disqualified based on religion, political belief, ideology, speech, or lawful association.
Only conduct, service, competence, and constitutional loyalty may be evaluated.

(d) No Discretionary Granting

No officer, agency, board, or tribunal may grant, deny, or condition Civic Citizenship except as required by the objective criteria of this Constitution and Section 4a.




Section 5. Civic Citizenship — Definition, Requirements, and Granting Authority

Civic Citizenship constitutes full citizenship within the Republic and confers the franchise, eligibility for public office, and full participation in the political sovereignty of the People.

This Section constitutes the exclusive and controlling definition of Civic Citizenship, its requirements, its method of attainment, and its legal effects.

(a) Definition and Nature

A Civic Citizen is a full participant in the political sovereignty of the Republic, having earned that status through verified public service, demonstrated competence, and sworn loyalty as defined herein.

Civic Citizenship is personal, eternal, non-transferable, and non-inheritable. It may not be purchased, granted by discretion, inherited, delegated, or revoked, except upon proof of grave constitutional betrayal as defined elsewhere in this Constitution, including willful breach of constitutional duty or commission of Tier Three offenses.

Persons who have not attained Civic Citizenship, including individuals born within the Republic to non-citizen parents absent qualifying service, retain all inalienable rights, civil liberties, and equal protection of law guaranteed under Section 2 of this Article, Article II, and Article XXVI of this Constitution.

Such persons shall not exercise full political sovereignty, including the franchise or eligibility for public office, until qualifying for Civic Citizenship in accordance with this Section.

(b) Age and Residency

An applicant for Civic Citizenship must have attained the age of adulthood, defined as twenty-one (21) years of age, and must have maintained continuous lawful residency within the Republic for no less than five (5) years immediately preceding application.

Law may provide narrowly tailored modifications to residency requirements for persons born within the Republic to citizen parents or where required by military necessity, provided that no such modification creates elite exemption or unequal civic standing.

(c) Civic Education and Oath

An applicant must complete civic education covering the Constitution, the history of the Republic, the structure and limits of government, and the duties of citizenship, and must swear a public oath of allegiance affirming loyalty to the Republic and its constitutional order.

The oath shall be binding and enforceable as a condition of Civic Citizenship.

(d) Qualifying National or Civic Service

Civic Citizenship shall be earned through voluntary initiation of qualifying national or civic service that is binding once undertaken and that is completed honorably.

Qualifying service must be arduous, public-facing, and oriented toward danger, hardship, trauma exposure, sustained labor, or material sacrifice for the protection of the innocent or the common good.

(1) Combat Military Service Term
Two (2) years of honorable service in combat roles within the armed forces shall satisfy the service-duration requirement.

(2) All Other Service Terms
Five (5) years of honorable service shall be required for all other qualifying avenues, including non-combat military roles and all civilian service pathways.

(3) Qualifying Fields (Illustrative and Non-Exclusive)
Qualifying service may include military service; policing; emergency response; firefighting; disaster relief; corrections roles involving direct management of dangerous offenders under strict oversight; frontline healthcare; mental health crisis care; public-facing teaching in hardship or high-risk placements; volunteer corps roles imposing sustained labor, hardship, or trauma exposure; environmental restoration; public works performed in hazardous or austere conditions; medical research or equivalent roles involving significant risk or sacrifice for the common good.

Service shall not be defined to include administrative, clerical, advisory, managerial, academic, symbolic, leisurely, or elite-protective assignments absent direct, sustained exposure to risk or hardship.

(4) Non-Delegation of Service Standards

Neither the Legislature nor any administrative body may redefine, dilute, bureaucratize, credential-substitute, or otherwise weaken qualifying service standards to reduce the hardship, danger, sacrifice, or public exposure required by this Section.

(e) Demonstrated Personal Responsibility

An applicant must demonstrate personal responsibility and good moral character, including the absence of felony convictions involving violence, fraud, corruption, or breach of public trust.

An applicant must demonstrate a sustained record of lawful employment or productive contribution, subject to reasonable exemptions for disability, caregiving, or retirement as defined herein, and must be current on lawful tax obligations and court-ordered financial duties.

(f) Granting Authority and Appeals

Upon fulfillment of all requirements set forth in this Section, Civic Citizenship shall be granted by an independent, non-partisan Civic Board established by this Constitution.

The Civic Board shall have no authority to impose requirements beyond those expressly enumerated herein, and any such attempt shall be void.

Decisions of the Civic Board shall be subject to judicial review and appeal as prescribed by law.

(g) Safeguards Against Abuse and Non-Politicization

The process for earning Civic Citizenship shall be administered by independent, non-partisan boards insulated from political control. Verification shall be objective, evidence-based, and subject to judicial review.

No pathway to Civic Citizenship may be conditioned on political belief, party affiliation, ideological conformity, or compelled expression beyond sworn loyalty to the Constitution and constitutional order.

Rectification pathways for individuals brought to the Republic as minors or for persons demonstrating exceptional contributions to the common good shall be transparent, limited in scale, governed by measurable criteria, and subject to oversight, consistent with Article I §7 and Article XXV.
(h) Public Record of Service

All qualifying service, certifications, and citizenship grants shall be recorded in a public, searchable ledger, except for narrowly classified security details.
Secrecy shall not be used to conceal favoritism, fraud, or improper grant. All records will be accessible through the Ministry of Records, pursuant to Article XXXIX.

(i) Equal Application of Standards

All applicants shall be evaluated under the same criteria and evidence standards.
No person or class shall be favored or disfavored by race, sex, wealth, ancestry, political belief, or institutional affiliation.

(j) Finality of Grant

Once Civic Citizenship is lawfully granted, it shall not be revoked or impaired except by conviction for constitutional betrayal or Tier Three offenses as expressly defined.
No retroactive rule, reinterpretation, or change in standards may affect previously granted status.

(k) Prohibition on Credential Substitution

No academic degree, license, certification, wealth, or professional status shall substitute for qualifying service or hardship under this Section.

(l) Mandatory Grant Upon Qualification

Where an applicant has met all constitutional requirements, the Civic Board shall grant Civic Citizenship.
Failure or refusal to do so shall constitute a constitutional violation subject to judicial compulsion and damages.


Section 6. Rights Exclusive to Full Civic Citizens

Only civic citizens shall enjoy:
(a) the franchise to vote in national, state, and local elections and binding referenda;
(b) eligibility to hold elected or appointed public office at any level;
(c) priority consideration in certain public benefits or protections as defined by law, provided that basic rights of lawful residents are not denied.
(d) Universal Incorporation Clause:
The standards for Civic Citizenship, political authority, suffrage, and eligibility for public office established by this Article apply uniformly and are binding upon the federal government, all states, territories, municipalities, and political subdivisions.
(e) Prohibition on Proxy Political Power
No non-civic resident may exercise political authority indirectly through representation, appointment, advisory bodies with binding power, or delegated governance.
(f) Limits on Priority Benefits
Priority benefits for civic citizens may not be used to coerce political conformity, ideological expression, medical treatment, surveillance participation, or surrender of constitutional rights.
(g) Preemption
Any state or local law, policy, charter, or regulation inconsistent with this Article is void.
No jurisdiction may supplement, narrow, evade, or redefine these standards.

Section 7. Native Peoples and National Stewardship of Heritage

(a) Indigenous peoples have the right to preserve languages, cultures, heritages, and traditional lands, and shall stand equal under the law.

(b) No permissible dual citizenship shall exist within the territories of the Republic as defined by law.

(c) Indigenous history, artifacts, and archeological sites shall be treated as national treasures. The Republic shall aid in maintenance and protection and shall appoint members of the tribe as stewards of tribal sites and custodial responsibilities.
(d) Corporate Self-Administration

Indigenous nations, tribes, or recognized peoples may form hereditary or lineage-based corporate entities under national corporate law for the purpose of managing cultural, land, and economic affairs.

Such entities shall possess full legal personality, including the rights to own property, contract, sue and be sued, and engage in commerce, subject to the Constitution and laws of the Republic.
(e) Land Conversion Authority

Tribal trust lands may be converted, in whole or in part, into corporate property owned by such tribal entities, subject to:
1. recorded consent of the governing body of the tribe;
2. environmental and heritage protections;
3. and national property law.

Such land shall thereafter be held, transferred, and developed under ordinary law, without creating separate sovereign jurisdiction.
(f) Judicial and Law Enforcement Integration

The Republic shall ensure that courts, prosecutors, and law enforcement are adequately staffed and funded to provide fair, timely, and impartial adjudication of all matters involving tribal lands, corporate entities, and tribal members.

No separate or parallel court system shall exist outside the constitutional judiciary.
(g) No Sovereign Carve-Outs

Nothing in this Section shall be construed to create:
1. dual citizenship,
2. territorial apartheid,
3. independent criminal or civil jurisdiction,
4. or exemption from constitutional law.

All persons and entities remain subject to the same Constitution.

(h) Grandfathered Tribal Enterprises

All lawfully existing tribal enterprises, including casinos, gaming operations, hospitality venues, resorts, liquor operations, entertainment properties, and other commercial undertakings operated by or for the benefit of Indigenous peoples as of the ratification of this Constitution shall be permanently grandfathered.

Such enterprises shall be recognized as vested corporate property of the tribal corporate entities established under subsection (d) and shall not be:
1. expropriated,
2. nullified,
3. dismantled,
4. or rendered economically nonviable
by any federal, state, or local law.
(i) Protection Against Regulatory or Tax Seizure

No government entity may target, suppress, or appropriate the economic value of grandfathered tribal enterprises through:
1. discriminatory taxation,
2. special fees,
3. licensing schemes,
4. zoning,
5. alcohol or gaming regulation,
6. or indirect economic strangulation.

Such actions shall be treated as unconstitutional takings requiring full restitution and damages.
(j) Protection of Tribal Inheritance

Grandfathered tribal enterprises may not be sold, transferred, leased, licensed, or conveyed to any non-tribal entity or to another tribe without approval by a recorded majority vote of the financial beneficiaries of that enterprise.

No sale, merger, or conversion may be compelled by any government.
(k) No Automatic Expansion Rights

Nothing in this Section grants any person or group the right to establish new gaming, liquor, or restricted enterprises except as permitted by general law applicable to all persons.

Grandfathering protects existing tribal enterprises only.
(l) Anti-Predatory Contract Protection

Any contract, loan, bond, derivative, concession, management agreement, or financial instrument encumbering grandfathered tribal enterprises shall be void if it:
1. grants effective control to a non-tribal party;
2. transfers profit streams without fair market compensation;
3. imposes compounding debt designed to trigger default;
4. or circumvents subsection (j) through financial engineering.
(m) Beneficiary Governance

All revenues from grandfathered tribal enterprises shall be distributed or administered for the benefit of the recognized tribal beneficiaries.

The identities of beneficiaries, revenue distributions, and major expenditures shall be recorded and subject to audit and judicial review.

No governing council, executive, or trustee may appropriate tribal wealth for private enrichment.
(n) Absolute Protection from Expropriation

No tribal corporate land, enterprise, or asset may be taken by eminent domain, redevelopment authority, public–private partnership, or any other forced transfer.

Such property shall be treated as inviolable private property under Article II.

Section 8. Status at Birth

A person born within the jurisdiction of the Republic shall possess legal personhood and full protection of law.

Political status at birth shall be determined as follows:

	•	If both parents are Civic Citizens of the Republic, the child shall be a Non-Civic Citizen.

	•	If one or both parents are Non-Civic Citizens or lawful residents, the child shall be a Non-Civic Citizen.

	•	If both parents are subjects or citizens of a foreign jurisdiction and lack lawful status, the child shall be conferred lawful resident status sufficient to prevent statelessness and permit travel documentation.

	•	No person shall acquire Civic Citizenship by birth, descent, or place of birth alone. All political authority must be earned pursuant to Section 5.

	•	Any person lawfully present in the Republic from childhood shall have full access to service pathways toward Civic Citizenship upon reaching adulthood. No person raised within the Republic may be permanently barred from earning Civic Citizenship absent disqualifying conduct under this Constitution.

No child shall be rendered stateless by operation of law.

No classification of birth status under this Section shall affect legal personhood, human dignity, civil rights, or equal protection of the laws.

Only political authority and eligibility for Civic Citizenship are governed by this Article.


Section 9. Civic Citizenship Is Earned, Not Inherited

Civic Citizenship, which confers voting rights and eligibility for public authority, shall be earned through lawful conduct, civic participation, and demonstrated allegiance to the Constitution.

No person shall acquire Civic Citizenship by inheritance, birthplace, lineage, wealth, or entitlement.


Section 10. Refugees and Extraordinary Regularization

Refugees, asylees, and unlawfully present persons may apply for lawful residency under conditions set by law.

In extraordinary circumstances, a person may be granted Non-Civic Citizenship solely to prevent statelessness, enable lawful employment, or permit travel documentation.

Such status shall confer no political rights and shall not substitute for Civic Citizenship.  (a) Individualized Determination Required

All grants of lawful residency or Non-Civic Citizenship under this Section shall be based on individualized findings.
No blanket, class-based, or mass regularization program is permitted.

(b) No Political Conversion

Non-Civic Citizenship granted under this Section shall not create voting rights, office eligibility, or presumptive entitlement to Civic Citizenship.
All political status must be earned under Section 5.

(c) Fraud and Misrepresentation

Any residency or Non-Civic Citizenship obtained through fraud, identity manipulation, or concealment of criminal history is void and revocable.

Section 11. Equal Opportunity, Not Equal Authority

All Non-Civic Citizens and lawful residents shall enjoy equal protection of law, due process, freedom of speech, and access to lawful opportunity.

Political authority shall remain reserved to those who earn Civic Citizenship.

Equality before the law shall not be construed as equality of governance.

Section 12. Oath of Loyalty and Constitutional Fidelity

(a) All civic citizens and all officeholders must swear an oath to the Constitution and to the Republic.
(b) Oaths to break or nullify the Constitution are unlawful and shall be treated as treason.
(c) Oathbreakers shall lose citizenship for treason or sedition against the Republic. Failure to make a reasonable effort to carry out sworn duties of office, including explicit promises made to citizens during tenure, shall result in penalties as defined by law.
(d) The Constitution may be altered only through the amendment process, which shall be structured to resist tyranny of the majority and to require sincere, public, evidence-based persuasion regarding necessity.
(e) Protected Dissent
Advocacy for constitutional amendment, repeal, reform, or restructuring through lawful processes shall not constitute oath-breaking, sedition, or treason.
(f) Action Requirement
No person shall be punished for oath violation, treason, or sedition absent proof of deliberate action to overthrow, nullify, or unlawfully subvert the constitutional order.
(g) Due Process for Oath Enforcement

Loss of Civic Citizenship or imposition of penalties under this Section shall require judicial conviction under the standards of Article II and Article VII.

Section 13. Loss, Suspension, and Restoration of Civic Citizenship

(a) Citizenship may be suspended or revoked for: treason; sedition; profound corruption; fraud in obtaining citizenship; or deliberate attempts to distort the law through knowing misinterpretation or through altering the definitions of words to serve political ends.
For purposes of this Section, revocation or suspension shall require proof beyond a reasonable doubt of intentional conduct constituting treason, sedition, grave breach of public trust, or knowing subversion of constitutional order, as determined by a jury and judge.
(b) Restoration may occur only after restitution and a well-reasoned apology assessed by a jury of peers and a judge, and only after a period of no less than seven (7) years.

(c) No person who has ever posed a mortal threat to the Republic may obtain civic citizenship or have it restored.
(d) Good-Faith Interpretation
No person shall be punished under this Section for disagreement, legal interpretation, advocacy, or scholarly opinion, even if later determined to be incorrect, unless deliberate and knowing intent to subvert constitutional order is proven.
(e) Non-Retroactivity
No change in constitutional interpretation, statute, or doctrine shall be applied retroactively to create grounds for loss or suspension of Civic Citizenship.
(f) Judicial Exclusivity
No officer, agency, board, or political body may suspend, revoke, or deny restoration of Civic Citizenship except pursuant to final judicial judgment under this Section.

Section 14 — Caregiver Citizenship Through Child-Rearing

(a) Purpose

The bearing and rearing of children in a stable, responsible household constitutes qualifying service to the Republic.

Primary caregiving for a dependent child may satisfy honorable-service requirements where it involves sustained labor, responsibility, and lawful custody.

(b) Eligibility for Mothers

A mother shall earn one term of honorable service credit upon:
	•	the live birth or lawful adoption of a child; and
	•	completion of five (5) continuous years of lawful, primary caregiving for that child.

Adoptive mothers shall be treated as equal to biological mothers for all purposes under this Section.

(c) Eligibility for Fathers

A father may earn one term of honorable service credit through primary caregiving only where:
	•	the mother is deceased, permanently incapacitated, or has voluntarily and lawfully relinquished parental responsibility;
	•	the father has obtained full lawful custody;
	•	a judicial tribunal certifies the legitimacy of the mother’s absence and the father’s custodial status; and
	•	the father completes five (5) continuous years of primary caregiving.

A father shall be permanently ineligible for caregiver-based service credit if the mother’s absence resulted from:
	•	homicide;
	•	disappearance or unexplained loss;
	•	abuse, coercion, or neglect;
	•	any conduct attributable to the father; or
	•	any circumstance under criminal investigation in which the father is a suspect, beneficiary, or person of interest.

(d) Safeguards Against Abuse

No person shall qualify for caregiver-based service credit where:
	•	custody was obtained through force, fraud, coercion, or harm;
	•	there exists any history of domestic violence or protective orders;
	•	the caregiver benefited from the mother’s absence; or
	•	any material doubt exists as to the legitimacy of custody or caregiving.

Where doubt exists, eligibility shall be denied.

(e) Judicial Certification

All father-based eligibility shall require certification by a Child and Family Tribunal composed of:

• one family-court judge,
• one magistrate, and
• one child-welfare officer.

No eligibility period shall commence absent tribunal certification verifying lawful custody, absence of disqualifying conduct, and the presence of stable caregiving conditions.

(f) Duration and Non-Stacking Rule

Five (5) full years of continuous, primary caregiving are required for each term of honorable-service credit.

Service credits may not be stacked or accelerated through multiple births or adoptions in overlapping periods. Neither shall they stack with other channels of civic service, such as the military or civil service corps.

(g) Prohibition on Political Instrumentalization

No child shall be used as a vehicle for political status, citizenship acquisition, or advantage.

Any attempt to obtain service credit through neglect, abuse, exploitation, or manipulation shall void all credits and trigger criminal liability.

(h) Crimes Against Caregivers

Any act of violence, coercion, fraud, or intimidation intended to obtain or benefit from a mother’s absence for citizenship or service credit purposes shall constitute:
	•	a Tier-Three offense; and
	•	permanent disqualification from caregiver-based service credit.

(i) Construction

This Section shall be construed to:

• protect women from incentive-driven harm;
• protect children from political or legal exploitation;
• recognize lawful caregiving as public service; and
• ensure that service credit reflects genuine responsibility rather than demographic or political manipulation.
(j) Mandatory Processing

Any caregiver who meets the requirements of this Section shall be entitled to timely tribunal review and certification.

Failure by any court, officer, or agency to process, decide, or certify eligibility within reasonable time shall constitute a violation of this Constitution and shall entitle the caregiver to judicial relief and damages.
(k) Separation from Benefits and Immigration Status

Caregiver-based service credit shall not be tied to, substituted for, or merged with any welfare, immigration, housing, or social benefit program.

No government may condition public benefits, residency, or legal status on childbearing or caregiving under this Section.

Section 15. Civic Structure Options and Democratic Safeguards

 The Republic may adopt or integrate evidence-based civic structures to reduce corruption, weaken professional political capture, and strengthen deliberation. Such mechanisms may supplement, review, or structure legislative processes as defined by law and consistent with constitutional rights.
All structures described in this Section are permissive, non-self-executing, and require separate enactment consistent with constitutional rights.
(a) Sortition-Based Systems
Randomly selected citizen bodies may serve legislative, agenda-setting, drafting, or review functions, including hybrid bicameral models. Stratified selection by age, sex, and region may be used to ensure demographic representation and reduce factional capture. Historical and modern examples include citizens’ assemblies used in Ireland, France, Belgium, and comparable systems.

(b) Liquid or Delegative Democracy
The Republic may employ systems allowing citizens to vote directly on issues or delegate votes to revocable proxies, including secure digital mechanisms that permit real-time transparency and accountability.

(c) Proportional Representation and Electoral Reforms
The Republic may adopt proportional or mixed electoral systems, ranked-choice voting, open lists, independent redistricting, and related reforms to reduce two-party dominance and improve representational fidelity. Parties will be limited in size to a county, or equivalent, area of land. No permanent coalitions can form to bypass this restriction. No money may flow between parties to bypass the purpose of this requirement.

(d) Deliberative and Participatory Enhancements
The Republic may require citizens’ assemblies, mini-public deliberation, evidence-based hearings, public consultations, transparency measures, binding petition thresholds, and citizen-initiated referenda under defined safeguards.

(e) Hybrid or Radical Structural Changes
Hybrid bicameral structures, parliamentary shifts, strict term limits, single-issue bill requirements, stock trading bans for legislators, stronger committee scrutiny, and data-driven policy simulation may be adopted where consistent with liberty, due process, and constitutional supremacy.

Section 16. Standing, Enforcement, and Remedy

Any lawful resident or civic citizen whose rights or pathway to citizenship is unlawfully obstructed has standing to sue the offending officer, agency, board, or jurisdiction. Courts shall provide timely remedies, including injunctive relief and compensation, consistent with due process.
(a) Exhaustion Not Required
No person shall be required to exhaust administrative remedies before seeking judicial enforcement of this Article.

Section 17. Failure to Protect   Public officials and persons vested with authority who knowingly fail to act to prevent imminent, grave harm within their lawful capacity may be subject to sanction.
(a) Knowledge and Capacity Required

Liability shall exist only where the person:
1. had actual knowledge of a specific and imminent threat of grave harm; and
2. possessed lawful authority and practical ability to intervene.

(b) No Strict Liability

No person shall be punished for error, misjudgment, resource limitation, or unforeseeable events.

(c) Judicial Determination Required

Sanctions under this Section require judicial findings by clear and convincing evidence.

Section 18. Civic Lottery Service and Deliberative Duty
(a) Purpose
The Republic may require limited deliberative service by Civic Citizens to counter elite capture, professional political insulation, and institutional self-dealing.

Such service constitutes a civic duty distinct from qualifying service for citizenship and shall not substitute for, reduce, or bypass the service requirements of this Article.

(b) Eligibility
Only full Civic Citizens in good standing may be selected for civic-lottery service.

No individual may serve if they:
	•	currently hold elected or appointed public office;
	•	are employed by, retained by, or materially invested in a sector directly affected by the matter under review;
	•	have served as a registered lobbyist, senior party official, or political operative within the preceding seven (7) years.

(c) Method of Selection
Civic Citizens shall be selected by stratified civic lottery, conducted publicly and subject to audit.

Stratification may account for:
	•	geographic distribution,
	•	age cohorts,
	•	sex,
	•	socioeconomic class,
to ensure broad representational balance without partisan filtering.

Selection shall be random within strata. No self-nomination or appointment shall occur.

(d) Term Limits and Rotation
Civic lottery service shall be:
	•	nonrenewable;
	•	limited to no more than two (2) consecutive years per body;
	•	capped at one lifetime term per constitutional body, and
	•	limited to one such service per ten-year period across all bodies.

This prohibition is absolute and shall not be waived.

(e) Authority and Limitations
Civic Citizens serving by lottery may:
	•	question experts and officials under oath;
	•	demand clarification of language, intent, and measurable outcomes;
	•	issue recorded majority or minority findings for the public record.

They shall not:
	•	vote on final legislation;
	•	exercise veto authority;
	•	draft binding statutory language absent express constitutional authorization.

(f) Compensation and Protection
Civic lottery service shall be compensated by modest stipend and expense reimbursement sufficient to ensure participation without financial coercion.

Civic Citizens shall be legally protected from retaliation, intimidation, or economic punishment arising from good-faith service.

Any attempt to corrupt or coerce a Civic Citizen shall constitute a felony offense.
(g) Prohibition on External Influence

No person, corporation, union, government, political party, or organization may provide money, gifts, services, employment promises, data, lobbying, or strategic assistance to any Civic Citizen selected for lottery service during or within two (2) years after such service.
(h) No Substitution for Elected Government

No civic-lottery body may enact, amend, repeal, delay, or veto any law, budget, regulation, or treaty.
Its function is deliberative and informational only unless expressly authorized by constitutional amendment.

Section 19. — Civic Franchise and Electoral Standing

(a) The right to vote in public elections is reserved exclusively to civic citizens, as defined in this Article.

(b) Civic franchise is a function of demonstrated civic duty, lawful standing, and accountability to the Republic, and shall not arise from residence alone, receipt of public benefits, demographic status, or dependency upon the State.
(c) The franchise shall not be expanded, contracted, conditioned, or manipulated for purposes of political reward, electoral inducement, demographic engineering, dependency creation, or partisan advantage.
(d) Elections exist to express legitimate consent of the governed and to confer lawful authority, and shall not be converted into instruments of mass inducement, coercion, or artificial mandate.
(e) Civic citizenship may require, as provided by law, proof of lawful status, non-disqualifying criminal standing unless rights have been restored, and demonstrated civic contribution, including but not limited to jury service, taxation upon earned income, military or national service, or other forms of public duty.
(f) No extension of franchise shall be granted on the basis of public benefit receipt, residency unaccompanied by civic duty, or group classification. Franchise qualifications shall remain neutral as to political belief, party affiliation, or viewpoint.
(g) Electoral eligibility and franchise qualifications shall be construed narrowly against expansion by implication and broadly in favor of civic accountability.
(h) No agency, registry, court, or executive officer may add, remove, or modify the electorate except through the procedures established by this Constitution and statute enacted pursuant to it. No Administrative Expansion is allowed.
(i) No government may offer, condition, expand, or withhold any public benefit, tax status, subsidy, service, or regulatory privilege in exchange for voting, registration, turnout, or political support. Vote-Buying by the State is prohibited.

Section 20. Lock Designation

Pursuant to Article XV (Amendments, Lock Clauses, and Anti-Emergency Drift), Article III — Citizenship and Civic Duty is hereby designated as LOCK-PROTECTED.

This designation reflects the deliberate judgment of the People that the allocation of political authority is a foundational matter of constitutional order, not a subject for casual revision, administrative drift, or judicial improvisation.

Section A. Scope of Lock

This Lock applies to the entirety of Article III, including but not limited to:
	•	definitions of civic status and citizenship;
	•	requirements for earning, exercising, suspending, or restoring Civic Citizenship;
	•	standards governing suffrage, eligibility for office, and political authority;
	•	service requirements, caregiver-based pathways, and civic duty structures;
	•	earned nature of Civic Citizenship, including service requirements, non-transferability, and safeguards against abuse;
	•	incorporation, enforcement, standing, and remedies.

No portion of Article III shall be repealed, suspended, weakened, narrowed, expanded by implication, or rendered ineffectual except in strict conformity with this Lock Declaration.

Section B. Prohibited Forms of Alteration

The following are expressly prohibited with respect to Article III:
	•	reclassification of Civic Citizenship as a caste, class, or status of personhood rather than a political trust and office of governance;
	•	dilution, delegation, or bureaucratic redefinition of qualifying service so as to reduce hardship, danger, sacrifice, or public exposure;
	•	creation of elite exemptions, credential-based substitutes, or proxy service pathways;
	•	state, territorial, or local deviation from or supplementation of civic citizenship standards;
	•	circumvention through emergency powers, national necessity claims, or administrative discretion;
	•	judicial reinterpretation that expands political authority without service or contracts the service required by this Article.

Any attempt to effect such alteration by statute, regulation, executive action, judicial doctrine, or intergovernmental agreement is void ab initio.

Section C. Permitted Amendments (Narrow Exception)

Amendment to Article III may occur only for the purpose of:
	•	clarifying internal consistency, definitions, or cross-article harmonization without reducing the substantive requirements or safeguards;
	•	expanding service pathways only where such pathways impose equal or greater hardship, risk, and sacrifice;
	•	strengthening enforcement, transparency, or anti-capture protections;
	•	addressing unforeseen methods of evasion, fraud, or coercion that threaten the integrity of civic citizenship.

No amendment may reduce service standards, relax eligibility thresholds, confer political authority without service, or introduce inherited, purchased, or proxy citizenship.

Section D. Amendment Threshold

Any amendment to Article III shall require all of the following:
	•	approval by a supermajority of both chambers of the Legislature, as defined in Article XV;
	•	certification by the Supreme Court of the Republic that the amendment does not undermine equal civil rights, constitutional supremacy, or the earned nature of political authority;
	•	independent review by the Constitutional Judicial Commission (CJC) affirming absence of institutional capture, factional advantage, or elite exemption;
	•	ratification by the People, under procedures no less rigorous than those required for original constitutional adoption.

Failure to satisfy any requirement shall invalidate the amendment in its entirety.

Section E. Anti-Backsliding Rule

No amendment, statute, regulation, or judicial interpretation adopted after ratification of this Lock shall be construed to:
	•	confer political authority absent service;
	•	weaken incorporation across states and subdivisions;
	•	reintroduce inherited, purchased, or automatic citizenship;
	•	erode safeguards against capture, fraud, or coercion.

No amendment, statute, executive action, or judicial doctrine may restore automatic, inherited, purchased, or birth-based full political rights except through the procedures and thresholds specified in this Section and certification of non-diminishment.
Where conflict exists, Article III shall control.

Section F. Judicial and Administrative Duty

All courts, agencies, boards, and officers of the Republic are bound to:
	•	enforce Article III as written;
	•	resolve ambiguities against expansion of political power without service;
	•	treat Civic Citizenship as a constitutional office of trust, not a mere benefit or entitlement.

Failure to honor this Lock constitutes constitutional misconduct.

Section G. Declaration of Civic Intent

This Lock affirms that self-government requires sacrifice, that authority must be earned, and that the franchise is not a commodity but a trust held for the Republic’s survival.

The People therefore place Article III beyond erosion by convenience, fear, faction, or ambition.
