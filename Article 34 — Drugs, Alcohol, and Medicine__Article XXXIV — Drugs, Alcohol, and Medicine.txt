Article XXXIV — Drugs, Alcohol, and Medicine

Section 1. Principles of Bodily Autonomy, Medical Freedom, and Public Safety

The Republic recognizes control over one’s own body, consciousness, and medical care as a fundamental liberty inseparable from dignity and self-ownership.

The purposes of this Article are to:
a. protect bodily autonomy and informed adult choice;
b. prevent catastrophic harm and violent abuse;
c. dismantle criminal monopolies and regulatory cartels;
d. promote safety, transparency, and accountability without coercion.

No substance, treatment, or intervention shall be prohibited solely on grounds of moral disapproval, political controversy, institutional inertia, or economic protectionism.

Public safety shall be secured through disclosure, education, purity, and accountability — not blanket prohibition or artificial scarcity.


Section 1A. Recovery-First Care; Prohibition on State Street Enablement

Drug policy shall address substance use disorder with medical rigor, fairness to the public, and a clear aim of reducing dependency, preventing death, and restoring lawful, stable participation in civil life.

a. Recovery-First Purpose
Public programs concerning addiction shall be structured to reduce dependency, prevent death, and promote recovery and reintegration, rather than to normalize, subsidize, or perpetuate public intoxication.

b. Prohibition on Government Street Enablement and Government Dispensary Functions
The Republic and the States shall not operate, fund, advertise, or administer any Street Enablement Program. Without limitation, the Republic and the States shall not distribute intoxicating or dependence-forming substances, nor distribute Use-Paraphernalia, for Off-Site Use or other non-therapeutic private consumption.

This prohibition bars the government from acting as a dispensary for non-therapeutic consumption. It does not bar private entities from selling lawful goods under general law, including needles or substances not deemed too dangerous, nor does it bar licensing, inspection, taxation, or regulation of such private activity.

Terms in this Section shall have the meanings given in Article 0.

This subsection does not restrict prescription or issuance of medical devices or medications for Therapeutic Administration or other medically indicated treatment as defined in Article 0.

c. Protected Medical Care
Nothing in this Section restricts legitimate medical care. Licensed medical facilities and licensed clinicians may provide evidence-based treatment for substance use disorder, including medically supervised withdrawal, detoxification, tapering, medication-assisted treatment, and sedation when clinical judgment determines sedation is necessary and the least harmful option for safety or stabilization.

d. Controlled Setting Requirement
Nothing in subsection (b) prohibits therapeutic administration within a Controlled Setting. Where the Legislature authorizes publicly funded addiction-related services involving controlled substances or Use-Paraphernalia, such services shall occur only in a Controlled Setting, with clinical supervision, controlled access, secure storage, and secure disposal adequate to prevent diversion and to protect public order.

e. Evidence-Based Clinical Exception; Narrow Tailoring
The Legislature may authorize limited facility-based programs when high-quality evidence shows such programs reduce death or severe harm and improve recovery outcomes compared to a hard abstinence-only protocol. Such programs shall be narrowly tailored, audited, and shall not include take-home distribution unless issued as medical treatment by a clinician acting within lawful scope of practice.

f. Research Pilots; Sunset; Termination Triggers
The Legislature may authorize time-limited research pilots for disputed or emerging interventions. Each pilot shall include clear outcome metrics, independent evaluation, a fixed sunset, and termination triggers if the program increases public disorder, increases dependency, increases overdose, or fails to outperform the comparator standard of care.

g. Public Order and Shared Space
The Republic and the States shall protect the public’s right to safe and usable streets, parks, transit, and neighborhoods. Open consumption of intoxicants in Public Space may be prohibited by law, and enforcement shall prioritize diversion to stabilization and treatment rather than punitive measures for mere status.

h. Emergency Measures Preserved
This Section does not restrict emergency overdose reversal, acute medical stabilization, contamination alerts, truthful risk education, or other measures aimed at preventing immediate death while routing persons toward treatment and recovery.

i. Enforcement
Claims alleging operation or funding of a prohibited Street Enablement Program shall be justiciable, with standing and remedies governed by Article VI-A (Courts, Jurisdiction, and Remedies) and Article VI-E (Transparency, Standing, and Records). Implementing law shall provide expedited review.
Section 1B. Enforcement and Remedies for Section

(a) Standing.
Any resident of the Republic, any affected local government, and the Attorney General shall have standing to seek injunctive relief to halt any Government Dispensary Function or Street Enablement Program prohibited by this Article. The Legislature may define additional standing by petition threshold for Civic Citizens.

(b) Expedited Review; Injunction Standard.
Courts shall provide expedited review for claims under this Section. Upon a prima facie showing that a prohibited program operates or receives public funds, courts shall enjoin continuation pending full adjudication unless the government proves compliance by clear and convincing evidence.

(c) Funding Consequences; Contract Remedies.
Any public expenditure made in violation of this Article is unlawful. Courts may order termination of contracts, rescission of grants, suspension of disbursements, and recovery of unlawfully expended funds, together with such further relief as is necessary to prevent recurrence.

(d) Accountability.
Any public official who knowingly authorizes, directs, or materially facilitates a prohibited program commits an offense as defined by law. Good-faith reliance on written clinical protocols within a Controlled Setting, and compliance with independent audits, constitutes a rebuttable defense.

(e) Audit and Public Reporting Duty.
Any publicly funded addiction-related program shall publish periodic outcome and spillover reports using standardized metrics, including recovery outcomes and Public Disorder Metrics, sufficient for independent review. The Legislature shall require independent evaluation for any program operating under an evidence-based exception or research pilot.

(f) Whistleblower Protection.
No employee or contractor shall be punished for good-faith reporting of violations of this Article. Retaliation is prohibited and punishable as defined by law.
Section 2. Evidence-Based Classification of Substances

All substances regulated under this Article shall be classified by objective risk and demonstrated harm, not ideology, origin, or historical stigma.

Tier I — Low Risk Substances

Substances with well-established safety profiles and low risk of acute harm.

Access:
Lawful for adult purchase, possession, and use.
No prescription required.
May be dispensed by licensed pharmacies or lawful vendors.
Subject only to labeling, purity, and age restrictions.

Includes (non-exhaustive):
Common alcohols, caffeine analogs, botanicals, supplements, nootropics, mild performance enhancers.

Tier II — Moderate / Contextual Risk Substances

Substances with meaningful risks requiring informed use but not warranting prohibition.

Access:
Available to adults through licensed pharmacies.
Requires standardized risk disclosure and optional pharmacist counseling.
Education requirements may exist only to inform, not to delay or deny access.

No registry, prior authorization, or individualized permission shall be required.

Includes (non-exhaustive):
Hormones, peptides, SARMs, ivermectin, psychedelics, MDMA, certain stimulants, weak opioids.

Tier III — High / Catastrophic Risk Substances

Substances with extreme addiction potential, lethality, or weaponization risk.

Access:
Restricted to medical, scientific, or tightly controlled contexts.
May require physician oversight, secure handling, and post-use accountability.

Criminal penalties apply primarily to trafficking, adulteration, and violent misuse — not mere possession absent harm.

The Legislature bears the burden of demonstrating net harm exceeding benefit to classify or retain any substance as Tier III.

Section 3. Pharmacies, Compounding, and Professional Autonomy

Licensed pharmacies, including compounding pharmacies, are recognized as essential institutions of medical liberty and public health.

Accordingly:

a. Compounding pharmacies shall have the right to formulate, dispense, and customize lawful substances in response to patient demand without being subjected to industrial manufacturing standards.

b. No regulatory body may impose compliance costs, production thresholds, or procedural requirements designed to suppress non-industrial or personalized pharmaceutical practice.

c. Pharmacists may dispense Tier I and Tier II substances without a physician prescription where permitted under this Article and shall not incur liability for doing so when proper disclosure and labeling are provided.

d. Pharmacists retain professional discretion to refuse combinations or dosages that present imminent danger, but shall not deny lawful access on ideological, political, or institutional grounds.

e. Independent laboratories may test, assay, and publish purity and safety data for lawful substances without retaliation or suppression.

f. Off-label use, patient-directed experimentation, and individualized treatment shall be lawful where informed consent is present.

g. No authority may require patient registries, surveillance systems, or tracking databases for lawful substance use.

h. Education or counseling requirements shall not be structured, priced, or administered so as to function as denial, delay, or de facto prohibition.

i. Safety and quality standards shall be scaled proportionally to demonstrated risk and production volume and shall not be structured to exclude small, independent, or non-industrial actors.
j. Pharmacist and Dispenser Good-Faith Immunity
Pharmacists, dispensers, and compounding professionals acting in good faith, within the scope of this Article, and with proper disclosure shall be immune from civil liability for harms arising from lawful dispensing absent fraud, recklessness, adulteration, or willful misrepresentation.

Section 4. Alcohol and Artisanal Production

The production, distribution, and consumption of alcohol are lawful adult activities subject to safety, purity, and transparency requirements.

a. Individuals may produce alcohol for personal use without licensing, provided such production does not involve sale or distribution to others.

b. Artisanal, small-scale, and independent alcohol producers shall not be subjected to industrial manufacturing standards, excessive taxation, or distribution requirements designed to favor large incumbents.

c. Direct-to-consumer sale and shipment of alcohol are lawful, subject only to age verification and reasonable fraud prevention measures.

d. No authority may impose surveillance, tracking, or behavioral monitoring systems on lawful alcohol purchase or consumption.

e. Taxes and fees applied to alcohol shall be uniform, transparent, and not structured to suppress small producers or function as disguised prohibition.

f. Public safety regulations related to intoxication shall address conduct that endangers others and shall not operate as moral enforcement.

Section 5. Intoxication, Responsibility, and Criminal Liability

The lawful use of any substance does not excuse criminal conduct.

a. Liability attaches to actions, not to the presence of substances in the body.

b. Intoxication shall not be a defense to crimes involving violence, negligence, or endangerment.

c. Where intoxication contributes to the commission of a Tier 3 crime under Article VII, it shall constitute an aggravating factor.

d. Nothing in this Article shall limit the admissibility of truthful, probative evidence in prosecutions for Tier 3 crimes.

Section 6. Trafficking, Adulteration, and Weaponized Substances

a. The adulteration of substances intended for human consumption constitutes a violent act against the public and shall be punished accordingly.

b. The manufacture, distribution, or use of substances intended to poison, incapacitate, or weaponize against others constitutes organized violent crime.

c. Trafficking offenses shall focus on coercion, fraud, adulteration, and distribution linked to violence or exploitation, rather than peaceful possession or consensual exchange.

d. Sentencing for trafficking shall scale with demonstrated harm, exploitation, and intent, not merely quantity.

e. Substance purity fraud shall be treated as aggravated fraud with enhanced penalties.

f. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to authorize broad prohibition or criminalization of lawful substances.

g. Emergency Containment
Temporary containment or restriction of a substance may occur only where there is a credible and imminent risk of mass harm.

Any emergency restriction imposed under this subsection shall expire automatically within ninety (90) days and may not be renewed, reissued, or extended indefinitely.

Each renewal requires a fresh legislative enactment by supermajority vote, public findings of necessity, and independent judicial review.

Section 7. Medical, Therapeutic, and Psychedelic Use

Medical autonomy and physician judgment are fundamental to patient-centered care.

a. Physicians and other licensed medical professionals may recommend, prescribe, or administer lawful substances consistent with patient needs, informed consent, and professional standards.

b. Therapeutic use of psychedelics and entheogens is lawful within medical, therapeutic, or supervised contexts where informed consent is present.

c. Patients may lawfully access therapeutic substances without arbitrary dosage caps or time limits unrelated to safety or efficacy.

d. No authority may require compulsory participation in registries, databases, or monitoring programs as a condition of lawful medical or therapeutic use.

e. Medical practitioners shall not be compelled to deny lawful treatment based on political, ideological, or institutional directives.

f. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to mandate treatment or to compel any individual to ingest or receive a substance against their will.

g. Medical confidentiality shall be preserved, subject only to narrowly tailored exceptions for imminent harm.

h. Access to lawful therapeutic substances shall not be restricted by geographic location, socioeconomic status, or institutional affiliation.

i. Experimental, compassionate-use, and right-to-try pathways shall remain open where informed consent is present and risks are disclosed.

j. Nothing in this Section shall limit the admissibility of truthful, probative evidence in prosecutions for Tier 3 crimes under Article VII.

k. Professional Board Limitation
No medical, pharmaceutical, or professional licensing board may discipline, sanction, or restrict a licensee solely for lawful conduct authorized under this Article.

Section 8. Performance Enhancement and Cognitive Liberty

a. The enhancement of physical or cognitive performance through lawful substances or methods is permitted where informed consent is present and no fraud or coercion occurs.

b. The Republic shall not criminalize enhancement for personal, professional, or competitive purposes.

c. Sporting organizations and private associations may regulate enhancement within competitions under their governance, provided such rules do not impose criminal penalties or public sanctions.

d. No authority may impose surveillance, testing, or monitoring for enhancement absent specific evidence of fraud, coercion, or endangerment.

Section 9. Review, De-Scheduling, and Liability Standards

a. Substances shall be subject to periodic review based on evolving evidence, safety data, and clinical outcomes.

b. Failure of the relevant authority to complete required review, reclassification, or de-scheduling within statutory timelines shall result in automatic provisional reclassification to the next less restrictive tier pending final determination.

c. No seller, pharmacist, manufacturer, or practitioner shall be held liable for harm resulting from lawful use absent fraud, recklessness, adulteration, or willful misrepresentation.

d. Collective liability doctrines based solely on association or distribution are prohibited.

e. No authority may delay, obstruct, or condition reclassification through procedural inertia or indefinite study.

Section 10. Employer, Institutional, and Insurance Non-Interference

a. Off-Duty Autonomy
Lawful use of substances under this Article shall not, standing alone, be grounds for denial of employment, housing, insurance, education, or professional opportunity.

b. Impairment Standard
Restrictions are permitted only where an employer, insurer, or institution demonstrates actual impairment during duty hours or safety-sensitive functions that materially affects specific, identified responsibilities.

c. No Moral or Lifestyle Governance
Off-duty, lawful conduct shall not be used as a basis for moral screening, lifestyle enforcement, ideological conformity, or proxy governance.

d. Burden of Proof
The burden rests on the restricting entity to demonstrate impairment or risk with objective evidence.

Section 11. Sunset, Preemption, and Anti-Cartel Enforcement

a. Sunset of Prohibition Authorities
All legacy drug-war statutes, emergency powers, and enforcement authorities inconsistent with this Article shall sunset within five (5) years of ratification unless reenacted in conformity with this Article.

b. Treaty Non-Self-Execution and Re-Ratification
No treaty, convention, guidance, or international coordination mechanism shall be deemed self-executing with respect to substance control.

Existing or prior international obligations inconsistent with this Article shall not bind the Republic absent explicit re-ratification consistent with Article XXVI.

No agency may enforce foreign substance restrictions absent express legislative enactment consistent with this Article.

c. No Semantic Re-Prohibition
Reclassification by analog, metabolite, derivative, or semantic substitution is prohibited absent evidence-based review and legislative approval.

d. Anti-Cartel Mandate
The Republic shall actively prevent the formation or maintenance of monopolies, cartels, or artificial scarcity in lawful substances through regulation, licensing, or enforcement practices.

e. Civil Asset Forfeiture Limitation
Property seized in violation of this Article shall be returned within fourteen (14) days. Failure to do so gives rise to damages and reasonable attorney fees.

Section 12. Construction

This Article shall be construed to:

a. end blanket prohibition permanently;
b. protect bodily autonomy and informed adult choice;
c. dismantle criminal and regulatory cartels;
d. punish violence, fraud, poisoning, and exploitation;
e. preserve medical, cognitive, and therapeutic liberty;
f. prevent agencies, corporations, or institutions from governing private life through coercion.

The Republic does not fear informed adults.
It fears concentrated power pretending to protect them.

Section 13. Essential Medicines, Fair Pricing, and Trade Integrity

a. Essential Medicines Defined
Essential medicines include substances required to preserve life, prevent irreversible catastrophic harm, or sustain ongoing survival in chronic conditions where interruption foreseeably results in serious injury or death.

b. Prohibition of Exploitative Pricing
No public or private entity possessing exclusive or dominant control over an essential medicine may impose prices that are grossly disproportionate to the combined and amortized costs of research, development, regulatory compliance, manufacture, distribution, and a reasonable risk-adjusted return.

c. Enforcement Trigger
Review under this Section may occur only upon complaint and a showing that:
	•	no reasonably available therapeutic substitute exists; and
	•	refusal or inability to pay the imposed price foreseeably results in serious harm or death.

d. Graduated Remedies
Upon a finding of exploitative pricing, remedies shall proceed in the following order:
	•	mandatory transparency sufficient for adjudication regarding aggregate costs and public funding received;
	•	judicial or independent determination of fair-access violation;
	•	compulsory licensing as a last resort, preserving patent ownership and providing reasonable royalty compensation.

e. Domestic Production Protection
The Republic shall encourage domestic manufacture of essential medicines and may provide lawful incentives to support resilient supply chains, provided such measures do not suppress competition or justify exploitative pricing.

f. Lawful Importation of Medicines
Essential medicines lawfully manufactured abroad may be imported where they meet domestic safety, purity, and labeling standards, particularly where foreign supply improves access, affordability, or continuity of care.

g. Ethical Trade and Tariffs
The Republic may impose proportional tariffs on medicines or components produced under conditions of forced labor, slavery, or coercive confinement.
Such tariffs shall:
	•	serve ethical correction rather than prohibition;
	•	not eliminate access to essential medicines where no reasonable alternative exists;
	•	not function as disguised protectionism or cartel enforcement.

h. Safety Supremacy
No medicine—domestic or foreign—shall be admitted or protected if it fails to meet objective safety and purity standards.

i. Construction
This Section shall be construed to preserve innovation, prevent extortion, protect life, and ensure that neither monopoly nor ideology determines who lives or dies.

Addendum: Emergency Medical Containment, Liability, and Transitional Safeguards
(Confirmatory Addendum — Doctrinal Clarification Only)

Section A. Non-Consensual Medical Containment — Confirmation

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to prohibit temporary non-consensual medical containment when required to prevent imminent and serious harm arising from:

a. Acute overdose or poisoning
b. Drug- or alcohol-induced psychosis
c. Violent intoxication presenting immediate danger
d. Severe withdrawal posing substantial risk of death or permanent injury

Such containment shall be medical and protective in nature, not punitive, and shall be governed exclusively by the Capacity-Based Intervention Principle.

Section B. Mandatory Treatment Offer During Containment

During any period of non-consensual medical containment authorized under this Article:

a. The individual shall be affirmatively offered appropriate medical treatment, stabilization, and evidence-based withdrawal or detoxification care.
b. Treatment shall not be conditioned on confession, cooperation, or waiver of rights.
c. Refusal of non-emergency treatment shall not extend the duration of containment beyond what is necessary to address imminent risk.

Section C. Limited Liability Shield for Good-Faith Actors

To prevent defensive denial of emergency care, pharmacists, bartenders, and similarly situated lawful service providers shall not be held civilly or criminally liable for outcomes arising from lawful provision of substances, absent clear evidence of:

a. Gross negligence
b. Willful misconduct
c. Deliberate poisoning or reckless endangerment

This protection shall not extend to unlawful distribution, adulteration, or knowing facilitation of imminent harm.

Section D. Emergency Scheduling Authority for Novel or Weaponized Substances

The Republic may establish a temporary emergency scheduling mechanism for:

a. Novel fentanyl analogs
b. Rapidly mutating synthetic intoxicants
c. Weaponized or mass-harm substances

Such emergency scheduling shall:

a. Be time-limited
b. Require public disclosure of scientific justification
c. Trigger expedited review for permanent classification or removal
d. Not be used to bypass legislative authority through indefinite renewal

Section E. Transitional Provisions for Legacy Opioid and Dependency Populations

Recognizing reliance created under prior medical and regulatory regimes:

a. Individuals with long-term dependency arising from lawful medical prescribing shall be entitled to medically supervised transition pathways, not abrupt deprivation.
b. No person shall be criminalized solely for physiological dependence created under prior legal standards.
c. Public health infrastructure shall prioritize stabilization, tapering options, and humane continuity of care.

Section F. Cross-Reference and Controlling Doctrine

All non-consensual interventions, emergency holds, and containment actions under this Article are governed by the Capacity-Based Intervention Principle, which controls evidentiary thresholds, duration, review, and restoration.

Nothing in this Article authorizes indefinite medical detention or coercive treatment absent constitutional compliance.

Section G. Locking Clause

This addendum clarifies interpretation only and does not reopen or amend the underlying text of Article XXXIV.
Upon adoption, Article XXXIV shall remain locked, subject only to formal constitutional amendment.
