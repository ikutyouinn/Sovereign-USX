Article XX-B — Sustainable Forestry, Agroforestry, and Land Enrichment

Charge

This Article establishes constitutional principles governing sustainable forestry, agroforestry, soil stewardship, and land enrichment practices within the Republic. Any public authority exercised under this Article shall be limited to lawful, transparent, and accountable measures designed to promote long-term soil health, ecological sustainability, food security, and environmental resilience. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to authorize centralized land control, ideological land management, compulsory practices, or regulatory overreach beyond powers expressly granted by law and subject to constitutional limits.

Section 1. Nature of Sustainable Forestry and Agroforestry Authority

a. Executive and Subordinate Character
Authority to promote, incentivize, or regulate sustainable forestry, agroforestry, polyculture, and soil enrichment (including terra preta-inspired biochar amendment) is executive in nature and exists solely to implement lawfully enacted policies of the constitutional branches.
b. No Independent Policymaking
No administrative body may mandate, expand, or interpret practices beyond explicit statutory authorization. Internal doctrines, academic theories, or ideological preferences (e.g., forced monoculture alternatives or exclusion of traditional methods) shall not bind the public or landowners.
c. Instrumental Role
Administration serves as a facilitator of voluntary, merit-based adoption — providing information, incentives, and technical support — not as governor of land use decisions.
d. Prohibition on Compulsion or Ideological Conditions
No authority may condition land use, subsidies, permits, or benefits on adherence to ideological, academic, or extraneous frameworks unrelated to lawful objectives.
Section 2. Core Principles and Practices Recognized
a. Recognition of Ancient Models
The Republic recognizes the proven efficacy of indigenous Amazonian practices: intentional creation of fertile anthropogenic soils (terra preta) via biochar from slash-and-char, organic amendments (manure, bones, pottery, compost), and polyculture agroforestry systems that integrate trees, crops, and useful species for sustained productivity, biodiversity, and long-term carbon sequestration.
b. Promotion of Voluntary Adoption
Lawful policy may encourage voluntary adoption through incentives (tax relief, grants, technical aid) for practices that:
	•	Enrich soils with stable biochar;
	•	Establish polyculture agroforestry and food forests;
	•	Use controlled, low-severity burns for nutrient cycling without large-scale deforestation;
	•	Integrate edible, medicinal, and resource species into managed forests.
c. Climate and Resource Benefits
Such practices serve the common good by: sequestering atmospheric carbon for centuries, enhancing soil fertility and water retention, increasing food/resource abundance, reducing pressure on wild forests, and building resilience to climate shifts.
Section 3. Limits and Safeguards
a. No Implied or Expanded Authority
No agency may claim power to mandate land conversion, restrict traditional farming, or impose standards absent explicit legislative grant.
b. Neutrality and Merit
Incentives and programs shall be based on demonstrable outcomes (e.g., soil improvement, carbon storage metrics) — not ideological alignment, demographic criteria, or credentialism.
c. Transparency and Accountability
All programs, incentives, and monitoring shall be public, recorded, and subject to review. Claims of expertise or necessity shall not defeat oversight.
d. Reservation of Rights
All powers not expressly granted are reserved to the People, landowners, and constitutional branches. Silence or custom shall not create authority.
e. Sunset and Reauthorization
Programs promoting these practices shall be subject to periodic legislative review and reauthorization.
