Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Registered Nurse position at Nova Via DX LLC in Tucson. I am a Master of Science in Nursing graduate from the University of Arizona and a licensed Registered Nurse seeking a full-time role in a structured acute detox setting.

My background includes psychiatric nursing and acute care experience. I am comfortable performing patient assessments, administering medications, documenting in the EHR, and collaborating with providers and other team members. I work best in environments with clear protocols, defined escalation criteria, and approachable leadership.

I have experience managing patients with medical and psychiatric instability and understand the importance of close monitoring, therapeutic language, and timely intervention. I can recognize changes in condition, communicate concerns promptly, and support transfer to a higher level of care when indicated.

I bring a calm, consistent approach to patient care and am accustomed to working in settings where boundaries, situational awareness, and professionalism are essential. My prior experience in behavioral health environments has reinforced the importance of maintaining safety, following procedure, and attending training.

I hold current BLS certification and am willing to obtain ACLS as required. I am reliable, detail-oriented, and focused on doing the job correctly rather than expansively.

If my skills and approach align with your current needs, I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the position further.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Robert Thomas
