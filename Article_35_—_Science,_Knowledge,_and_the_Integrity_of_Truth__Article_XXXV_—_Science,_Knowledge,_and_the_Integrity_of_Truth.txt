Article XXXV — Science, Knowledge, and the Integrity of Truth

Charge

A Republic that abandons truth abandons self-government.

Science, scholarship, and discovery exist to illuminate reality as it is—not as ideology, prestige, funding, or fashion would prefer it to be. Where inquiry becomes subordinated to narrative, where evidence yields to orthodoxy, or where dissent is punished rather than tested, knowledge decays into propaganda and civilization stagnates.

This Article secures the independence, rigor, and honesty of scientific and scholarly endeavor, ensuring that knowledge serves truth, human flourishing, and the long-term needs of the Republic—not institutional self-preservation or political convenience.
For purposes of this Article, “truth” refers to correspondence with reality as determined through evidence, reproducible methods, and open challenge, and not to official declaration or authority.

Section 1. Purpose of Science and Scholarship

Scientific, archaeological, anthropological, and academic inquiry within the Republic shall be oriented toward:

a. discovery of objective reality through evidence and reason;
b. falsifiability, replication, and methodological rigor;
c. honest uncertainty where evidence is incomplete;
d. technological, medical, and civilizational advancement;
e. preservation of historical truth without ideological distortion.
No discipline shall be insulated from challenge by appeal to authority, consensus alone, or institutional status.
These orientations govern the conduct and evaluation of publicly funded, publicly empowered, or publicly relied-upon inquiry, and do not prescribe conclusions or restrict good-faith disagreement.

Section 2. Evidence Over Narrative

All publicly funded research, scholarship, and excavation shall adhere to the principle that:

Evidence governs conclusions, not conclusions governing evidence.

It shall be prohibited to:

a. suppress data inconsistent with prevailing theories;
b. destroy, conceal, or withhold artifacts, samples, or records for reputational, ideological, or political reasons;
c. reinterpret findings to fit predetermined narratives absent evidentiary support;
d. prohibit lawful alternative hypotheses from being explored, published, or debated.
Deliberate deletion, corruption, manipulation, or suppression of primary digital data, archives, research corpora, or training datasets for ideological, political, reputational, or institutional reasons shall constitute destruction of evidence under this Article.
Any person, institution, or affected researcher shall have standing to petition the Constitutional Review Court for preservation orders, disclosure, injunctions, and constitutional remedies upon a prima facie showing of evidentiary suppression or risk of spoliation.
Where credible, reproducible evidence contradicts established theory, theory must yield to the extent required by the evidence.
All preservation orders, disclosures, datasets, and archives required under this Article shall be lodged with or mirrored to the Public Ministry of Records pursuant to Article XXXIX.

Section 3. Peer Review as Truth-Seeking, Not Gatekeeping

Peer review shall function as a method of error correction, not ideological enforcement.

Accordingly:

a. anonymous review shall be permitted but not mandatory, provided that anonymity shall not be used to evade accountability for suppression or misconduct;
b. dissenting or minority findings may not be rejected solely for contradicting prevailing consensus;
c. methodological criticism must be specific, substantive, and evidentiary;
d. replication studies shall be valued equally to novel findings.
Procedural delay, indefinite review, serial demands for non-material revisions, or administrative obstruction used to prevent lawful publication, replication, or dissemination shall be treated as suppression under this Article.
The Constitutional Review Court shall have authority to enjoin abusive peer review, order publication, compel disclosure of review records, and impose constitutional remedies where this Section is violated, subject to remedies narrowly tailored to cure suppression without compelling substantive endorsement.
Systematic abuse of peer review to suppress dissent, competitors, or heterodox inquiry shall constitute professional misconduct.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall audit peer review systems, funding bodies, and publication pipelines for systemic abuse, cartelization, or ideological gatekeeping.

Section 4. Academic Freedom and Accountability

Academic freedom protects inquiry, not falsehood.

Researchers and scholars shall enjoy full freedom to:

a. pursue lawful research;
b. publish findings;
c. criticize prevailing theories;
d. revise or abandon their own conclusions.

Such freedom does not shield:

a. fabrication or falsification of data;
b. deliberate misrepresentation of findings;
c. retaliation against dissenters;
d. misuse of academic authority to coerce belief.

Academic misconduct shall be subject to transparent investigation and sanction consistent with due process, including notice, evidentiary disclosure, opportunity to respond, and neutral adjudication.
Good-faith error, failed hypotheses, or conclusions later shown to be incorrect shall not, by themselves, constitute misconduct.
The Constitutional Review Court may order reinstatement, funding restoration, injunctive relief, and suppression of retaliatory actions subject to remedies narrowly tailored to cure the violation without compelling belief, endorsement, or substantive conclusions.
For purposes of this Section, “academic authority” includes control over grading, credentialing, funding recommendations, publication access, hiring, tenure, or professional standing exercised under color of institutional power.

Section 5. Archaeology, Anthropology, and Historical Integrity

Archaeological and anthropological inquiry shall be conducted with:

a. preservation of physical evidence;
b. transparency of methods and provenance;
c. open access to primary data where feasible;
d. respect for cultural heritage without surrendering scientific integrity.
Where excavation, extraction, or destructive testing is conducted, complete documentation and preservation of primary evidence shall be required to the maximum extent feasible.
No political, ideological, religious, identitarian, or reputational claim shall override, suppress, or displace material evidence.
The Republic rejects both mythologizing the past and sanitizing it.

Section 6. Public Funding, Transparency, and Replication

Publicly funded research shall require:

a. disclosure of funding sources and conflicts of interest;
b. publication of underlying data where security, privacy, or narrowly defined national defense considerations permit;
c. allowance for independent replication and audit;
d. sunset review of funding programs tied to demonstrated results.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to investigate publicly funded research bodies, academic institutions, data repositories, and accreditation authorities for institutional capture, ideological enforcement, funding coercion, or suppression of lawful inquiry, and may certify such findings to the Constitutional Review Court.

Funding mechanisms shall not be structured to reward conformity, ideological alignment, or institutional entrenchment.

Funding, publication, or career advancement systems shall not be structured to indirectly suppress lawful inquiry, including through algorithmic scoring systems, automated review pipelines, or opaque evaluative criteria.

Section 7. Protection of Heterodox and Minority Inquiry

The Republic affirms that many advances arise from minority views.

No scholar shall suffer loss of position, funding, or professional standing solely for:

a. proposing unpopular hypotheses;
b. challenging dominant frameworks;
c. publishing inconvenient findings.
No adverse action may be justified by pretextual allegations where the substantial motivating factor is protected inquiry under this Section.
Claims shall rise or fall on evidence and method alone.
Where adverse action is taken against a scholar engaged in protected inquiry, the burden shall rest on the institution to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that such action was unrelated to the protected activity.

Section 8. Science in Service of the Republic

Scientific and scholarly institutions exist to serve:

a. truth;
b. human well-being;
c. technological advancement;
d. public safety;
e. informed self-government.

They shall not operate as:

a. ideological enforcement arms;
b. unaccountable priesthoods;
c. closed guilds hostile to correction.

Obligations under this Article attach directly to publicly funded or publicly empowered institutions; private institutions remain free but may not claim public authority, funding, or accreditation while systematically violating its principles, including eligibility for accreditation, credential recognition, and access to public research consortia.
For purposes of this Article, “publicly empowered” includes any institution or body granted regulatory authority, licensing power, accreditation authority, exclusive advisory status, or formal reliance in public decision-making.
Section 9. Rules of Construction and Scope

This Article shall be construed to protect and enforce the integrity of scientific and scholarly processes, including open inquiry, falsifiability, reproducibility, and good-faith challenge, rather than to mandate or privilege any particular conclusion, theory, or narrative.
In applying this Article, no court, agency, or officer of the Republic shall treat consensus, authority, institutional prestige, or popularity as a substitute for evidence, reproducibility, or methodological transparency.
No obligation or prohibition under this Article may be delegated to private actors in a manner that evades constitutional accountability.
Obligations, duties, and enforcement mechanisms under this Article apply only to institutions, bodies, and activities that are publicly funded, publicly empowered, publicly accredited, or explicitly relied upon by the Republic for official decision-making, certification, regulation, or public record, except where private conduct constitutes the destruction, concealment, falsification, or suppression of evidence of public, historical, or scientific significance.
Nothing in this Article authorizes the Republic to declare scientific conclusions as true or false. The Republic’s authority is limited to safeguarding the processes by which truth is pursued, tested, challenged, preserved, and recorded.
Such private conduct shall be subject to this Article only to the extent necessary to preserve, recover, or prevent the loss of such evidence.
Section 10. Cultural and Historical Sites — Public Trust with Just Compensation

a. Public Trust Doctrine for Irreplaceable Heritage
Archaeological, historical, and culturally significant sites of demonstrable and exceptional value to human knowledge or collective heritage may be designated as protected cultural sites held in public trust, regardless of prior ownership.

Such designation exists solely for preservation, study, and public benefit—not ideological, political, or economic exploitation.

b. Just Compensation Requirement
No private land, structure, or improvement shall be seized, restricted, or materially encumbered under this Article without fair and prompt compensation, reflecting:
	•	market value absent designation,
	•	loss of reasonable use, and
	•	documented economic impact.

Compensation shall be mandatory, not discretionary.
Compensation determinations shall be subject to judicial review and may not be deferred, conditioned, or substituted with regulatory permission alone.

c. No Constructive Confiscation
Regulatory burdens imposed under cultural protection shall not be used to render property economically nonviable as a means of de facto seizure.

Where preservation materially restricts ordinary use, compensation or acquisition shall be required.
For purposes of this Section, “exceptional value” shall mean significance that is rare, non-replicable, and materially advances historical, scientific, or cultural understanding beyond ordinary local interest.

Section 11. Evidentiary Threshold for Site Designation

a. High Standard of Proof
Designation of protected cultural status shall require clear, material, and independently verifiable evidence of genuine historical or scientific significance.
Speculative claims, disputed interpretations, or isolated minor artifacts shall not suffice.
All evidence relied upon for designation shall be preserved, documented, and made part of a publicly accessible evidentiary record, subject to narrow redactions for site protection.
b. Anti-Abuse Clause
The presence of incidental artifacts, isolated pottery fragments, or non-contextual remnants shall not be used to justify:
	•	blanket land confiscation,
	•	indefinite construction bans, or
	•	arbitrary expansion of protected zones.

Designation must be narrow, site-specific, and evidence-driven.
Expansion of a protected zone beyond the footprint supported by evidence shall require a renewed evidentiary showing meeting the same standard as initial designation.
c. Independent Review
All designations shall be subject to review by an independent, multidisciplinary body insulated from political, ideological, or financial pressure.
Any affected landowner, researcher, or citizen shall have standing to challenge designation, expansion, restriction, or enforcement actions taken under this Article.

Section 12. Preservation with Public Access

a. Presumption of Public Access
Protected sites held in public trust shall, wherever reasonably feasible, be made accessible to the public, subject to:
	•	conservation requirements,
	•	safety constraints, and
	•	cultural sensitivity.

Preservation shall not be used as a pretext for secrecy, exclusivity, or academic hoarding.
Restrictions on access shall be the least restrictive means necessary to achieve conservation or safety objectives.
b. Balanced Access Models
Access may include guided visitation, controlled entry, seasonal access, digital replication, or other methods that preserve both integrity and public benefit.
Permanent closure shall require compelling justification and periodic review.
Any restriction resulting in closure or materially limited access shall be subject to periodic review at intervals not exceeding five (5) years.

Section 13. Absolute Prohibition of Looting, Theft, and Vandalism
a. Crimes Against Civilization
The intentional and knowing looting, destruction, theft, trafficking, or defacement of protected cultural, archaeological, or historical materials shall constitute grave offenses against the Republic, distinct from ordinary property crimes.
The use of cultural artifacts, antiquities, or historically significant objects as instruments for money laundering, sanctions evasion, tax evasion, or concealment of criminal proceeds constitutes a grave offense against the Republic.  No transaction involving protected cultural materials shall be afforded legal recognition absent verifiable provenance, lawful custody, and transparent beneficial ownership.
b. Enhanced Penalties
No transaction involving protected cultural materials shall be afforded legal recognition.
Such offenses shall carry severe criminal penalties, including:
	•	long-term imprisonment,
	•	forfeiture of proceeds and instrumentalities,
	•	permanent exclusion from cultural, academic, or excavation privileges,
	•	and any such transaction shall be void ab initio.
c. Claims for Repatriation
Claims for repatriation of cultural artifacts shall be evaluated solely on evidentiary, historical, custodial, and preservation grounds, and shall not be compelled by political pressure, diplomatic leverage, ideological claims, or threats.
Burden of proof shall rest on the claimant to establish lawful origin, continuity of custody, and capacity for preservation.
No statute of limitations shall apply to major cultural theft or destruction.

Section 14. Armed Protection and Use of Force Authorization

a. Authority to Guard Protected Sites
The Republic may authorize by statute or narrowly tailored executive order subject to legislative oversight, including armed guards—public or deputized—to protect designated cultural and historical sites of exceptional importance.

Such protection is deemed a defense of irreplaceable public trust assets.

b. Use of Lethal Force
Where an individual is caught in the act of:
	•	destroying,
	•	stealing,
	•	irreversibly damaging, or
	•	attempting to remove protected artifacts or structures,

and where such loss would constitute irreparable harm to human heritage, and no other means reasonably available would prevent the loss, lethal force is constitutionally authorized as a last resort.

c. No Duty to Retreat
Guards acting under this authority shall have no duty to retreat when preventing the active destruction or theft of protected heritage.
Any use of lethal force under this Section shall be subject to prompt independent review consistent with Article XXIV, without presumption of wrongdoing.
d. Harmonization with Articles VII and XXIV
Use of force under this Section shall be construed as defensive and preventive, not punitive, and shall be evaluated under the principles of necessity, proportionality, and last resort, with proportionality assessed in light of the irreparable civilizational harm prevented.

Section 15. Prohibition on Ideological or Opportunistic Designation
Cultural protection shall never be used to:
	•	dispossess political opponents,
	•	advance religious or identitarian claims unsupported by evidence,
	•	block lawful development absent genuine historical necessity, or
	•	entrench academic monopolies.
Claims of sacred, cultural, or historical status unsupported by material evidence shall confer no special protection, restriction, or designation under this Article.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to audit and certify whether cultural, archaeological, or historical designations are being used as instruments of political dispossession, academic monopoly, or ideological control.
All authority under this Article exists to preserve truth and heritage, not to weaponize them.
Where abuse is found, the Constitutional Review Court may invalidate designations, restore property rights, award compensation, and enjoin further misuse of authority.

Section 16. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted and applied to:
(a) preserve civilization and irreplaceable heritage while respecting private property rights and the requirement of just compensation;
(b) protect knowledge, inquiry, and evidence without authorizing ideological coercion, compelled belief, or institutional orthodoxy;
(c) maximize public access and transparency consistent with conservation, safety, and evidentiary integrity;
(d) authorize protective measures proportionate to the demonstrated irreplaceability and civilizational significance of the threatened loss.

In construing this Article, courts and officers of the Republic shall give weight to the principle that destruction of non-replicable knowledge, evidence, or heritage constitutes irreversible harm warranting heightened protection, subject always to necessity, proportionality, and due process.
