Article XVI — Elections and Democratic Legitimacy

Charge

This Article establishes constitutional requirements governing elections and the democratic legitimacy of public authority within the Republic. All electoral processes shall be conducted transparently, securely, and verifiably, and shall be designed to ensure accurate expression of voter intent, equal participation, and public confidence in electoral outcomes. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to authorize electoral manipulation, unreviewable procedures, or the exercise of governmental authority absent lawful and credible elections.
Legal Text

Section 1. Authority Over Elections

a. Source of Authority

The authority to conduct elections arises from the People and is exercised through the States, subject to this Constitution. Elections are a public trust, not a partisan instrument.

b. Hybrid Administration Model

Elections shall be administered by the States within a uniform constitutional framework established by the Republic to ensure fairness, security, and equal protection.
States retain operational control; the Republic retains oversight authority to guarantee constitutional compliance.

c. Federal Standards

Congress shall establish national minimum standards governing:
	•	voter eligibility verification;
	•	ballot integrity and chain of custody;
	•	auditability and recount procedures;
	•	election security against fraud, coercion, and foreign interference;
	•	transparency and public observability.

No State may fall below these standards.

d. Prohibition on Federal Control of Outcomes

Neither Congress nor the Executive may dictate election outcomes, manipulate vote counting, interfere with lawful State administration, or delay elections except as constitutionally authorized.

e. Election Oversight Tribunal (EOT)
The EOT’s jurisdiction includes campaign finance, contribution limits, disclosure compliance, and unlawful election-influence expenditures under Article XVI-C.
A permanent, independent EOT shall:
	•	audit compliance with this Article;
	•	hear procedural challenges;
	•	certify national election integrity;
	•	refer violations for prosecution.

The Tribunal shall consist of nine members, appointed through the Constitutional Judicial Commission (CJC) process defined in Article VI, serving staggered nine-year terms, and shall be subject to institutional-integrity supervision by the CJC and constitutional-compliance review by the Constitutional Review Court (CRC).
f. Transparency Requirement

All election procedures, software specifications, chain-of-custody rules, audit methods, and certification standards shall be public by default.

g. Interpretation

This Section preserves State administration, national legitimacy, voter confidence, and the sovereignty of the People.

Section 2. The Right to Vote

a. Citizenship Requirement

The right to vote is reserved exclusively to Civic Citizens. No legal resident or non-civic person may vote in any election.

b. Condition of Capacity

Voting requires reasoned judgment. No person may vote while intoxicated, impaired, or cognitively incapacitated.
No proxy or caretaker voting is permitted.

c. Primary Voting Method

Voting shall occur in person at supervised polling locations using physical paper ballots as the controlling legal record, with identity and biometric verification via transparent, publicly auditable systems.

Biometric data shall be:
	•	minimized;
	•	stored locally;
	•	deleted immediately after verification.

d. Secure Digital Voting in Special Circumstances

Secure digital machine voting (via phone or computer) is permitted only for:
	•	active-duty military personnel deployed overseas;
	•	diplomatic personnel stationed abroad;
	•	verified medically incapacitated Civic Citizens unable to travel.

Such voting must use end-to-end verifiable, publicly auditable systems with biometric pre-registration and supervised transmission.

e. Prohibited Practices

Mail-in ballots, ballot harvesting, drop boxes, unsupervised remote voting, and internet voting outside the above exceptions are prohibited.

f. National Election Day

A national Election Day shall be a federal holiday.
Employers are strongly encouraged to grant paid leave.
Employees denied time off for voting due to ideological or partisan motive may sue for damages.

g. Uniformity

These standards apply to all elections at every level.

h. Interpretation

The ballot is a responsibility exercised with sobriety and presence.

Section 3. Voter Eligibility and Voter Rolls

a. National Civic Voter Roll

A single National Civic Voter Roll shall contain only eligible Civic Citizens.

b. Eligibility Criteria

Enrollment requires:
	•	verified Civic Citizenship;
	•	completed service obligations;
	•	lawful age;
	•	capacity;
	•	biometric uniqueness.

No excessive documentation may disproportionately burden eligible citizens.

c. Automatic Enrollment and Maintenance

Enrollment is automatic upon certification of Civic Citizenship.
Rolls shall be continuously maintained to remove deceased, ineligible, or duplicate entries.

d. Prohibition on Arbitrary Purges

No mass or algorithmic purges are permitted without individualized cause and due process.
Removal requires notice, evidence, and opportunity to contest.

e. Annual Public Audit

The voter roll shall undergo an annual public audit.

f. Criminal Penalties

Manipulation of voter rolls constitutes a Tier III offense.

g. Interpretation

The integrity of the roll is the integrity of the Republic.

Section 4. Ballots and Voting Methods

a. Authorized Ballots

Only uniform, publicly issued paper ballots (or secure digital equivalents in approved special circumstances) may be used.

b. Polling Places and Observers

Voting occurs only at supervised polling locations with non-partisan citizen observers.

Intoxicated or disruptive individuals shall be denied voting, subject to provisional review.

d. Chain of Custody

Every ballot shall be tracked, sealed, logged, and transported under dual custody.

e. Counting

Counting shall occur publicly, transparently, and promptly, with livestreaming where practicable.
Paper ballots (or verified digital records) govern.

f. Prohibited Practices

Ballot harvesting, unsupervised vote curing, drop boxes, and post-hoc reinterpretation are forbidden.

g. Interpretation

Convenience shall never outweigh legitimacy.

Section 5. Election Administration and Oversight

a. State Administration

States administer elections as fiduciaries of the People.

b. Federal Oversight

The Republic audits compliance but does not control outcomes.

c. Mandatory Audits

All elections undergo post-election audits prior to certification.

d. Certification

No officeholder may assume office prior to lawful certification.

Political interference with administration or audits is a Tier III offense.

Section 6. Political Parties and Coalitions

a. Permitted Scope

Political parties may organize at the county, parish, or State level.

b. Temporary National Coalitions

Temporary, election-specific national coalitions are permitted and must dissolve immediately upon certification.

c. Prohibition on Permanent National Parties

Permanent national or multi-jurisdictional super-parties are forbidden.

	•	all permitted political contributions and expenditures shall be disclosed in real time; and
	•	corporate, foreign, union, and anonymous political money is prohibited.

Any construction that permits circumvention through intermediaries, parallel committees, “independent expenditures,” or functional equivalents is forbidden.
e. Interpretation

Factions may compete and coordinate temporarily. They may not entrench permanent dominance.

Section 7. Election Security and Integrity

	•	Foreign Interference

Foreign involvement in elections constitutes an attack on sovereignty.

	•	Cybersecurity

Election infrastructure must be domestically owned, auditable, and hardened.

	•	Intelligence Neutrality

Intelligence agencies may not influence domestic political outcomes.

	•	Interpretation

The Republic protects debate; it does not tolerate manipulation.

Section 7A. Forfeit-to-Run for National Executive Office

	•	Purpose.

This Section prevents divided loyalties, neglected duties, and retaliatory leverage that may arise when an incumbent officeholder seeks the National Executive while retaining an office that can shape budgets, investigations, confirmations, or coercive governance.

	•	Covered Offices.
This Section applies to any person who, at the time of qualification, holds:
(a) any seat in the National Legislature;
(b) any Governorship or equivalent chief executive office of a State or Province; or
(c) any national office designated by law as an “Executive-Sensitive Office” due to direct control over force, intelligence, revenue enforcement, prosecutions, or emergency powers.

	•	Trigger: Qualified Candidacy.
A “Qualified Candidacy” begins upon the earliest of the following:
(a) official certification for the general-election ballot for President or Vice President by the competent body designated under the Election Code and supervised by the Election Oversight Tribunal (EOT); or
(b) formal nomination, endorsement, or selection as the Presidential or Vice-Presidential candidate of a recognized political party under the Election Code; or
(c) satisfaction of objective viability thresholds defined by statute, which shall include both:
    (i) demonstrated ballot access in not fewer than ten (10) States or Provinces; and
    (ii) demonstrated public support or fundraising above thresholds set by statute.
No statute may define thresholds in a manner that targets named individuals or a single party, nor may a statute set thresholds so low that trivial candidacies routinely trigger forfeiture.

	•	Mandatory Forfeiture.
Upon the start of a Qualified Candidacy, the officeholder shall forfeit the covered office automatically and immediately by operation of law. The vacancy shall be filled under the ordinary vacancy rules for that office.

	•	Immediate Loss of Leadership Powers Upon Declaration.
Upon public declaration of intent to seek nomination for President or Vice President, and upon filing any required preliminary candidate paperwork, the officeholder shall:
(a) relinquish all legislative or executive leadership posts (including chairmanships, whip roles, leadership caucus positions, and agenda control);
(b) lose authority to initiate or control investigative subpoenas, contempt proceedings, or budgetary holds in any capacity tied to the covered office; and
(c) enter “Campaign Leave” status as defined by statute, which shall restrict official travel, staff direction, and official communications to routine constituent services and emergency matters only.
This subsection expires automatically if no Qualified Candidacy begins within ninety (90) days of declaration, and it may not be re-triggered more than once per election cycle for the same officeholder absent a Qualified Candidacy.

	•	Anti-Circumvention.
No officeholder may evade this Section through temporary resignation and immediate reappointment, appointment of proxies, or delegation arrangements designed to preserve effective control. Any such arrangement shall be void, and any act taken under such arrangement shall carry no legal effect.

	•	Enforcement and Rapid Review.
The Election Oversight Tribunal (EOT) shall publish determinations of Qualified Candidacy within seven (7) days of any triggering event. The EOT may require the Election Code to designate an administrative office to receive filings and compile evidence, but the EOT shall remain responsible for issuance and publication of determinations. Any affected person may seek expedited review in the Constitutional Review Court, which shall resolve the dispute within fourteen (14) days. The Court shall apply a clear-and-convincing standard for any claim that a triggering event did not occur.

	•	Construction.
This Section does not limit lawful speech, lawful criticism, or lawful oversight by any former officeholder acting as a private citizen. This Section governs officeholding and institutional powers only.

Section 8. Counting, Certification, and Audit

a. Public Counting

Counting shall be observable, documented, and prompt.

b. Audits and Recounts

Mandatory audits precede certification.
Full recounts occur when statutory thresholds are met.

c. Finality

Once certified and remedies exhausted, results are binding.

Section 9. Disputed Elections and Remedies

a. Right to Challenge

Challenges require credible, material evidence.

b. Exclusive Forums

Disputes shall be adjudicated only by the Election Oversight Tribunal or the Constitutional Review Court, with the Constitutional Review Court possessing mandatory jurisdiction over claims alleging constitutional violation, systemic manipulation, or loss of democratic legitimacy.

c. Remedies

Remedies must be proportional and narrowly tailored.

d. Nullification

Nullification is permitted only where legitimacy is irreparably compromised, upon:
(1) a two-thirds finding by the Election Oversight Tribunal and confirmation by the Constitutional Review Court; or
(2) a Supreme Court finding of irreparable constitutional destruction.

e. Scope and Targeting of Electoral Remedies

Any nullification, invalidation, recall, forced re-election, or removal exercised pursuant to this Article shall be specific to the office, contest, or electoral body directly affected.
No single petition, tribunal finding, judicial order, or popular act may dissolve, purge, or invalidate an entire branch of government in aggregate.
Executive officers shall be removable individually by office.
Legislative bodies may be subject to re-election by chamber, not jointly.
Judicial officers may be removed individually, including a chief justice, but the judiciary as an institution shall not be dissolved by collective action.

Remedies shall preserve constitutional continuity while restoring legitimacy.
f. Interpretation

Disputes must end, or the Republic cannot endure.

Section 10. Election Crimes and Penalties

a. Election Crimes

Willful evasion of campaign finance limits, disclosure requirements, or the prohibitions of Article XVI-C, when material in amount or reasonably capable of influencing an election, constitutes an election crime punishable as a Tier II offense, and escalates to a Tier III offense where the conduct involves laundering, coordinated proxy structures, organized schemes, or where investigation of any single offense reveals a pattern of materially similar violations by the same actor or coordinated group.

b. Aggravated Offenses

Foreign collaboration and systemic fraud carry enhanced penalties.

c. No Statute of Limitations

There is no statute of limitations for crimes against democratic legitimacy.

Section 11. Media, Technology, and Intelligence Separation

a. Absolute Separation

Intelligence agencies may not partner with or embed in media or technology platforms.

b. Revolving Door Ban

A minimum seven-year separation applies between intelligence service and platform authority.

c. Algorithmic Neutrality

Search engines, feeds, and AI systems may not manipulate political visibility or outcomes.

d. AI Constraints

AI may present facts and labeled opinion aggregates only; it may not persuade.

e. Transparency

All government–platform contacts must be disclosed.

f. Interpretation

Debate is protected. Manipulation is forbidden.

Section 12. Civic Trust and Democratic Legitimacy

a. Legitimate Authority

All authority derives from informed, sober, voluntary consent expressed through lawful elections.

b. Manufactured Consent Forbidden

Legitimacy may not be claimed through deception, coercion, or manipulation.

c. Finality and Transfer

Certified elections require peaceful transfer of power.

d. Right of Resistance

When a government systematically subverts elections, suppresses lawful remedies, and rules without genuine consent—upon a two-thirds declaration by State legislatures convened in constitutional convention or a Supreme Court finding of irreparable constitutional destruction—the People retain the inherent right of resistance, including insurrection, as a last resort.

This right arises only when constitutional order has been destroyed, not merely when outcomes are disputed.

e. Enduring Covenant

Where elections are honest, the Republic endures. Where elections are corrupted, liberty collapses.

f. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to preserve trust between the People and their institutions, recognizing that without trust, law decays into force, and authority into tyranny.
