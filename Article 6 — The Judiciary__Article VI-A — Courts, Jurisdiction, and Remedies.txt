Article VI-A — Courts, Jurisdiction, and Remedies

(Authoritative, Integrated Version)

Section 1. Judicial Structure

The judicial system of the Republic consists of:
	1.	the Supreme Court of the Republic;
	2.	the Circuit Courts of the Republic; and
	3.	the District Courts of the Republic.

The Supreme Court and the Constitutional Review Court shall each consist of nine (9) judges.

The Circuit Courts shall initially consist of nine (9) circuits.

⸻

Section 1A. Judicial Expansion and Geographic Reach

Additional circuits may be established by law without fixed numerical cap, provided that any such expansion satisfies all of the following constitutional conditions:
	1.	Neutral Justification
Expansion shall be justified by objective criteria, including sustained population growth, persistent and excessive caseload burdens, permanent extraterritorial jurisdictions, or geographic scale impairing reasonable access to appellate review.
	2.	Prospective Application Only
No circuit may be created, altered, divided, or realigned to affect the outcome of any pending case or to advantage or disadvantage any political faction.
	3.	Uniformity and Structural Integrity
Circuit boundaries shall preserve geographic coherence, administrative efficiency, and doctrinal consistency.
	4.	Anti-Fragmentation Safeguards
Expansion beyond nine (9) circuits shall include statutory mechanisms to reduce intercircuit conflict and prevent regionalized lawmaking.
	5.	Constitutional Review
Any law restructuring circuits shall be subject to mandatory review by the Constitutional Review Court.

Any circuit established in violation of this Section is void.

Section 2. Supreme Court Jurisdiction

The Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction only where expressly authorized by this Constitution and appellate jurisdiction as provided by law.

The Supreme Court shall decide only actual cases and controversies and shall not issue advisory opinions except where expressly permitted by this Constitution.

Section 3. Circuit and District Court Jurisdiction

Circuit Courts shall exercise appellate jurisdiction and such original jurisdiction as may be assigned by law consistent with this Constitution.

District Courts shall exercise original jurisdiction subject to appellate review.

No court shall extend its jurisdiction by implication, convenience, or necessity.

Venue shall be proper only where a substantial nexus exists.

Forum shopping, judge shopping, and strategic venue manipulation are prohibited.

Courts shall dismiss or transfer actions brought in bad faith.

⸻

Section 5. Standing and Justiciability

Standing shall be liberally granted for claims alleging violation of this Constitution, provided a concrete or direct deprivation is shown.

Courts shall dismiss moot, nonjusticiable, or abusive actions and may impose sanctions for vexatious litigation.

⸻

Section 6. Scope of Remedies

Judicial remedies shall be limited to the parties before the court and narrowly tailored to redress the proven injury.

Courts shall not issue remedies that effectively legislate, administer, or regulate beyond the case at hand.

⸻

Section 7. Prohibition on Nationwide Injunctions

No court shall issue nationwide, universal, or non-party injunctions except where this Constitution expressly authorizes such relief.

Declaratory judgments shall not bind non-parties absent constitutional authorization.

Section 8. Temporal Limits on Relief

Injunctive or extraordinary relief shall include defined duration and shall expire automatically unless renewed upon fresh findings.

Permanent injunctions are disfavored.

⸻

Section 9. Appellate Review and Remedy Correction

Appellate courts shall correct jurisdictional or remedial excess without disturbing lawful findings unnecessary to correction.

⸻

Section 10. Prohibition on Judicial Lawmaking

Courts shall interpret and apply law; they shall not create, amend, suspend, replace, or rewrite statutes or constitutional provisions under the guise of interpretation or remedy.

Policy determinations remain the province of the Legislative Branch.

⸻

Section 10A. Bench Legislation as Constitutional Misconduct

Bench legislation—the creation, amendment, suspension, or effective replacement of law or constitutional meaning by judicial decree rather than interpretation—is a grave constitutional violation.

A pattern of bench legislation, or a willful act thereof, constitutes abuse of judicial office and a breach of the separation of powers.

No claim of necessity, efficiency, moral urgency, evolving standards, or perceived justice shall excuse bench legislation.

⸻

Section 11. Interpretation

This Subarticle shall be interpreted to preserve access to justice while preventing judicial usurpation of legislative authority and maintaining the constitutional separation of powers.
