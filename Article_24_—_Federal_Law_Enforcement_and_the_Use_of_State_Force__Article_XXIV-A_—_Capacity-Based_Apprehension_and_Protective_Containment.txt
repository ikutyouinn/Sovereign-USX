Article XXIV-A — Capacity-Based Apprehension and Protective Containment 

Charge

The Republic recognizes that imminent threats to life and safety may arise from temporary loss of capacity due to intoxication, addiction, acute psychiatric instability, neurological impairment, or comparable conditions. This Addendum authorizes narrowly tailored, non-punitive apprehension and protective containment to prevent imminent serious harm, while preserving constitutional rights, due process, and human dignity.

Protective containment under this Article is preventive and medical in nature and shall not be construed as punishment, detention for ideology, or a substitute for criminal adjudication.

Section 1. Authority to Apprehend Without Consent

Federal law enforcement officers and authorized protective services may apprehend an individual without consent only where clear and convincing evidence demonstrates an Imminent and Specific Risk of serious harm to the individual or others, arising from temporary incapacity, including but not limited to:

(a) verified intoxication or toxicological impairment combined with dangerous conduct;
(b) credible suicidal or homicidal threat corroborated by behavior, witness testimony, or clinical indicators;
(c) acute psychosis, delirium, or neurological dysfunction producing loss of self-control or reality testing;
(d) severe withdrawal or overdose risk likely to result in death or grave injury absent immediate intervention.

Mere suspicion, nonconformity, speech, belief, status, or diagnosis alone shall never constitute sufficient grounds.

Section 2. Mandatory Safeguards and Procedures

All non-consensual apprehensions under this Article shall comply with the following non-derogable safeguards:

(a) Least-Restrictive Means — containment shall employ the minimum restraint necessary to prevent imminent harm;
(b) Medical Priority — the individual shall receive prompt medical and psychological evaluation by qualified professionals;
(c) Judicial Review — judicial review shall occur within a fixed and brief period, not to exceed [24–72] hours, as defined elsewhere in this Constitution;
(d) Time Limitation — protective containment shall automatically expire absent renewed, individualized findings;
(e) Humane Conditions — conditions shall be therapeutic, non-punitive, and distinct from penal detention;
(f) Notice and Counsel — the individual shall be informed of the basis for containment and afforded access to counsel or an advocate.

Failure to comply with any safeguard renders the apprehension unlawful.

Section 3. Absolute Prohibitions

The following are categorically prohibited:

(a) ideological, political, or belief-based detention;
(b) indefinite or open-ended containment;
(c) secret facilities, undisclosed locations, or extrajudicial transfer;
(d) use of protective containment to evade criminal due process or civil commitment standards;
(e) coercive interrogation or forced treatment beyond emergency stabilization.

No emergency, statute, or executive order may override these prohibitions.

Section 4. Liability and Enforcement

Any officer, agency, or contractor who knowingly exceeds or abuses authority under this Article shall be subject to:

(a) personal civil liability;
(b) exclusion of evidence obtained through unlawful containment;
(c) disciplinary action and removal from service;
(d) criminal prosecution where appropriate.

Qualified immunity shall not apply to violations of this Addendum.

Any person shall have standing to challenge unlawful apprehension or systemic abuse before the Constitutional Review Court.

Section 5. Emergency Medical Containment

Non-consensual medical containment may be employed solely for the purpose of preventing imminent serious harm arising from acute meaningfully impairing conditions, including but not limited to overdose, severe intoxication, psychosis, delirium, or life-threatening withdrawal.

Such containment shall:

(a) be governed exclusively by the capacity-based apprehension and protective containment standards set forth in Article XXIV;
(b) prioritize stabilization, treatment offer, and restoration of capacity rather than punishment or coercion;
(c) be strictly time-limited and subject to mandatory judicial review;
(d) occur in medical or therapeutic settings distinct from penal detention.

No medical authority, facility, or practitioner may detain, restrain, or treat an individual absent compliance with Article XXIV safeguards.

Section 6. Protections for Providers and Third Parties

Pharmacists, physicians, nurses, emergency responders, and licensed vendors of regulated substances shall not incur civil or criminal liability for lawful conduct performed in good faith under this Article, absent gross negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate harm.

Nothing in this Article authorizes compelled administration of medication to minors, dependents, or incapacitated persons beyond emergency stabilization necessary to prevent imminent harm, except pursuant to separate lawful process.

Section 7. Construction

This Article shall not be construed to create a general police power in medical institutions, nor to permit preventive detention based solely on diagnosis, status, substance use, or nonconformity.
All emergency medical containment exists to restore capacity and liberty, not to suppress conduct, belief, or identity.
This article shall be construed narrowly to permit humane intervention solely to prevent imminent serious harm, and broadly to protect liberty, bodily integrity, and constitutional supremacy.
Protective containment under this Article does not diminish natural rights and affects only capacity-conditioned rights for the duration strictly required to restore safety and capacity.
