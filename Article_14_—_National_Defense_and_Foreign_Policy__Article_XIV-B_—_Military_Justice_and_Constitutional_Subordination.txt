Article XIV-B — Military Justice and Constitutional Subordination

Section 1. Establishment of Military Justice

The Republic may maintain a system of military justice to enforce discipline, readiness, lawful orders, and the laws of war within the Armed Forces.

Military justice exists to preserve lawful command — not to insulate the military from constitutional law.

Section 2. Jurisdiction

Military courts shall have jurisdiction only over:

(a) service members on active duty;
(b) offenses arising directly from military service;
(c) violations of the laws of war;
(d) conduct affecting readiness, security, or lawful command.

Military courts shall have no jurisdiction over:

(a) civilians;
(b) constitutional interpretation;
(c) the legality of war, surveillance, or detention;
(d) political, speech, or belief-based offenses.

Section 3. Due Process and Rights

Service members retain all constitutional rights except where narrowly limited by the necessities of service and due process.

No military tribunal may:
	•	deny counsel,
	•	suppress exculpatory evidence,
	•	use secret law, or
	•	impose punishment absent a public, recorded proceeding.

Section 4. Subordination to the Constitutional Review Court

All military justice proceedings, including courts-martial and disciplinary actions, shall be subject to constitutional review by the Constitutional Review Court for:

(a) jurisdiction;
(b) legality of orders;
(c) constitutional compliance;
(d) proportionality of punishment.

The CRC shall have authority to:
	•	stay proceedings;
	•	suppress unlawfully obtained evidence;
	•	vacate unlawful convictions;
	•	enjoin unconstitutional prosecutions.

Decisions of the CRC are subject to appellate review by the Supreme Court of the Republic.

Section 5. Protection Against Command Influence

No commander or chain of command may:

(a) direct the outcome of any military judicial proceeding;
(b) retaliate against a service member for lawful defense or refusal of unlawful orders;
(c) interfere with counsel, evidence, or review.

Violations constitute grave offenses.

Section 6. Institutional Integrity and the CJC

The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have authority to:

(a) audit military courts, JAG offices, and disciplinary systems;
(b) investigate retaliation, command coercion, or secret tribunals;
(c) certify institutional capture or abuse;
(d) petition the CRC for emergency relief, suspension of proceedings, or structural remedies.

No military justice system may operate beyond civilian constitutional oversight.

Section 7. No Emergency or War Exception

No state of war, emergency, or national security claim may suspend:

(a) CRC review;
(b) CJC oversight;
(c) service member due process; or
(d) the prohibition on secret tribunals.

Military necessity does not override constitutional law.

Section 8. Construction

This Article shall be construed to ensure:
	•	discipline without tyranny,
	•	obedience without blind loyalty,
	•	readiness without lawlessness, and
	•	a military that serves the Republic, not itself.
