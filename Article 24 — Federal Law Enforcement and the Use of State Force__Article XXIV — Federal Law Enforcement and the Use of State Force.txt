Article XXIV — Federal Law Enforcement and the Use of State Force
Charge
Force is the most dangerous power entrusted to a Republic.
When law enforcement forgets that it exists to protect the People rather than rule them, liberty dies quietly, behind badges and sealed orders.
Free nations do not fall first to invasion, but to normalization of coercion: militarized agencies, secret authorities, rolling emergencies, and enforcement bodies that answer upward rather than outward.
This Article affirms that all state force is exceptional, limited, transparent, and subordinate to civil authority and individual rights. The federal government may enforce the law, but it shall never dominate the People, replace the states, or operate beyond democratic constraint.
Section 1. Principle of Limited and Accountable Force
a. Force as Last Resort
The use of physical force by the federal government is lawful only when strictly necessary to enforce constitutional law, protect life, or prevent grave and imminent harm. Convenience, expediency, or administrative efficiency shall never justify force.
b. Civil Supremacy
All federal law enforcement exists to serve civilian governance and constitutional law. No enforcement body shall act as an independent power center, political instrument, or sovereign authority.
c. Individual Accountability
No officer, agent, or contractor is exempt from personal legal responsibility for unlawful acts, even when acting under orders, policies, or classified directives.
Section 2. Scope and Limits of Federal Law Enforcement Authority
a. Enumerated Jurisdiction Only
Federal law enforcement authority is limited to:
	•	Enforcement of federal criminal law expressly enacted by the legislature
	•	Protection of federal courts, officials, and constitutional processes
	•	Interstate or international crimes whose scope, scale, or multi-jurisdictional complexity renders enforcement by individual states impracticable, as demonstrated by specific factual findings subject to judicial review
	•	Matters explicitly delegated to the federal government by this Constitution
Mere resource limitations, policy disagreement, or administrative convenience shall not constitute incapacity.
Federal enforcement may supersede state authority only where state incapacity is documented, contemporaneously justified, and subject to independent judicial review.
b. No General Police Power
The federal government shall possess no general police power over the People. Federal agencies shall not patrol, investigate, detain, or enforce absent a clear constitutional or statutory basis.
c. Anti-Pretext Enforcement
Federal jurisdiction shall not be expanded through creative interpretation, administrative rulemaking, data aggregation, or joint task forces designed to bypass state authority or constitutional limits.
Section 3. Prohibition of Federal Militarization
a. Civilian Character Mandate
Federal law enforcement agencies shall remain civilian in nature. Military weapons, tactics, vehicles, and command structures are prohibited except in narrowly defined emergency circumstances authorized by law.
b. Restricted Equipment
The routine use or stockpiling of battlefield weapons, armored vehicles, crowd-control chemical agents, or military surveillance systems by federal law enforcement is prohibited.
c. No Standing Domestic Occupation Force
The federal government shall not maintain standing forces designed for continuous domestic population control, mass protest suppression, or indefinite internal security operations.
Section 4. Use of Force Standards
a. Necessity and Proportionality
Any use of force must be strictly necessary and proportionate to the immediate threat. Deadly force is lawful only to prevent imminent loss of life or catastrophic harm.
b. Affirmative Duty to De-Escalate
Federal officers have a constitutional duty to attempt de-escalation when feasible. Failure to do so constitutes a violation of this Article.
c. Duty to Intervene
Any officer who witnesses unlawful or excessive force by another officer has an affirmative duty to intervene and to report the violation.
Section 4a. Distinction Between Arrest and Protective Containment
Arrest constitutes a criminal seizure undertaken for purposes of prosecution.
Protective containment constitutes a temporary, preventive restraint undertaken solely to prevent imminent serious harm arising from temporary incapacity.

Protective containment shall not initiate criminal proceedings, toll statutes of limitation, create criminal records, or substitute for arrest where probable cause of a completed offense exists.

Section 5. Transparency, Records, and Surveillance Constraints
a. No Secret Policing
No federal law enforcement body may operate secret detention facilities, undisclosed enforcement programs, or classified legal interpretations that affect the rights of the People.
b. Public Reporting
All federal agencies exercising enforcement authority shall publish regular, auditable reports detailing:
	•	Arrests and detentions
	•	Use-of-force incidents
	•	Surveillance activities authorized and denied
	•	Complaints, disciplinary actions, and prosecutions of officers
c. Body and Event Recording
When feasible, enforcement actions shall be recorded. Destruction, suppression, or tampering with such records constitutes a felony.
d. Surveillance as Precursor to Force
Domestic surveillance conducted for the purpose of enabling enforcement action shall be subject to the same constitutional standards, transparency requirements, and judicial oversight as the use of force itself.
Intelligence collection shall not be used to circumvent the protections of this Article.
Section 6. Prohibition of Secret Courts and Emergency Abuse
a. No Unreviewable Warrants or Orders
All warrants, subpoenas, and enforcement orders must be subject to independent judicial review. Secret courts issuing binding orders without adversarial process are prohibited.
b. Absolute Limits on Emergency Authority
No emergency enforcement authority may be renewed, reissued, or extended beyond its initial statutory term.
Any subsequent emergency authorization addressing substantially similar conditions shall require:
	•	A fresh legislative enactment by supermajority vote
	•	Public findings of necessity
	•	Independent judicial review
Rolling, continuous, or functionally identical emergency declarations are prohibited.
Secret courts issuing binding orders without meaningful judicial oversight, recorded reasoning, and post-hoc review are prohibited.
Section 7. Interagency Conduct and Task Forces
a. No Jurisdiction Laundering
Joint task forces shall not be used to circumvent constitutional protections, state law, or statutory limits by delegating prohibited actions to another agency.
Evidence obtained through joint operations that would have been unlawful if conducted directly by federal officers shall be inadmissible in all proceedings, and no intergovernmental agreement may cure such violation.
b. Clear Command Responsibility
Every joint operation must identify a single accountable commanding authority. Diffusion of responsibility shall not shield misconduct.
Section 8. Prohibition of Political Policing
a. Viewpoint Neutrality
Federal law enforcement shall not investigate, surveil, or target individuals or groups based on political belief, speech, association, religion, or lawful dissent.
b. No Enforcement for Political Advantage
The use of federal enforcement power to influence elections, suppress opposition, protect incumbents, or retaliate against critics is a constitutional violation.
Section 9. Remedies and Enforcement
a. Private Right of Action
Any person who suffers concrete injury, deprivation of rights, or unlawful coercion as a result of a violation of this Article has a direct right to bring civil and criminal action against responsible officers, supervisors, and agencies.
b. No Qualified Immunity
Qualified immunity shall not shield federal officers or agents from liability for constitutional violations.
c. Jurisdiction, Venue, and Waiver of Immunity
The United States expressly waives sovereign immunity for all claims arising under this Article.
Actions may be brought in any federal district where the violation occurred or where the plaintiff resides or, where justice so requires, where a substantial part of the unlawful conduct occurred.
No doctrine of abstention, exhaustion, deference, or political question shall bar adjudication of claims under this Article.
d. Exclusionary Rule
Evidence obtained in violation of this Article is inadmissible in any proceeding.
Section 10. Non-Delegation and Contractors
a. No Outsourced Coercion
The federal government shall not delegate law enforcement or coercive authority to private contractors, corporations, or foreign entities.
b. Color of Federal Authority
Any person acting under color of federal authority, including contractors, subcontractors, private prison personnel, corporate security, or temporary agents, shall be subject to the same constitutional duties, prohibitions, and liabilities as sworn federal officers.
Section 11. Supremacy of This Article
Federal enforcement authority shall be exercised subject to the limitations and State safeguards set forth in Article XXVIII-A, which governs nullification, anti-coercion, and State interposition. This Article binds all branches, agencies, and officers of the federal government. No statute, regulation, executive order, treaty, or classification may override its provisions.
Section 12. Construction
This Article shall be construed broadly in favor of liberty, transparency, and restraint, and narrowly against unchecked force, secrecy, and consolidation of power.

All federal law enforcement authority exercised pursuant to this Article is subject to the constraints, prohibitions, accountability mechanisms, and dissolution provisions set forth in Article XXX — Federal Enforcement Authority, Accountability, and Civic Restraint, which shall be construed as complementary, controlling where applicable, and binding regardless of the statutory or administrative basis under which such authority is claimed.
