Article XVIII-A — Higher Education Accountability and Non-Predatory Financing

Charge

This Article establishes constitutional requirements governing the financing, pricing, disclosure, and accountability of higher education institutions operating within the Republic. Academic freedom in teaching, inquiry, and expression shall be preserved, while financial practices that impose deceptive costs, disproportionate debt burdens, or long-term dependency without commensurate educational value are prohibited. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to restrict lawful fields of study or expression, provided that educational offerings are financed, disclosed, and administered in a manner consistent with constitutional safeguards against exploitation.

Section 1. Academic Freedom Preserved

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to prohibit or suppress any lawful field of study, inquiry, or expression, including theoretical, artistic, philosophical, or social disciplines.

Institutions may offer non-remunerative or low-remunerative programs, provided such programs are priced, disclosed, and financed in a manner consistent with this Article.

⸻

Section 2. Prohibition on Predatory Educational Debt

No educational institution, public or private, may knowingly induce, facilitate, or rely upon debt financing that:

(a) is grossly disproportionate to the demonstrated economic or vocational payoff of the instruction provided;
(b) would reasonably be expected to impose long-term financial incapacity, dependency, or insolvency upon the student absent extraordinary fortune;
(c) relies upon misleading representations, selective statistics, or omission of material outcome data.

For purposes of this Article, “educational institution” includes any entity that offers instruction, training, certification, or credentialing in exchange for compensation, regardless of degree-granting status, accreditation label, or marketing designation.

Debt incurred for education shall not be exempt from any constitutional debt limitation, discharge provision, or jubilee established by this Constitution.

⸻

Section 3. Mandatory Outcome Disclosure and Informed Consent

Prior to enrollment, institutions offering instruction above a defined cost threshold shall provide clear, standardized disclosure of:

(a) median earnings of graduates at five (5), ten (10), and twenty (20) years;
(b) typical debt burdens and repayment outcomes;
(c) variance and distribution of outcomes, not merely averages;
(d) historical rates of default or non-completion.

For programs not reasonably expected to yield substantial financial return, institutions shall obtain a written acknowledgment from the student affirming understanding that the program is pursued primarily for non-economic reasons and is priced accordingly.

Failure to provide accurate disclosure shall render associated debt presumptively unenforceable.

⸻

Section 4. Separation of Education from State-Issued Debt

The Republic shall not maintain a general system of state-issued student loans.

Nothing in this Section shall prohibit:

(a) private lending subject to constitutional debt laws and remedies;
(b) voluntary, informed private financing without state guarantee;
(c) repayment-free public grants as provided in Section 5.

The absence of state-issued loans shall not be construed to relieve institutions of compliance with this Article.

⸻

Section 5. Public Grants and Non-Debt Support

The Republic may fund higher education through non-repayable grants, scholarships, or stipends, financed exclusively from:

(a) net proceeds derived from currency issuance or monetary operations;
(b) unspent, lapsed, or surplus public funds;
(c) other non-debt public revenues authorized by law.

Such grants shall prioritize:

(a) fields essential to civic continuity, public safety, health, infrastructure, science, and education;
(b) affordability and broad access without credential inflation;
(c) institutions and programs that demonstrate cost discipline and transparency.

No grant program shall be used to subsidize inflated tuition, administrative bloat, or institutional rent-seeking.

⸻

Section 6. Prohibition on Credential Arbitrage and Degree Inflation

No institution may structure academic programs primarily to:

(a) maximize debt extraction through stacked credentials;
(b) impose unnecessary degree requirements unrelated to demonstrated competence;
(c) gate access to lawful employment through artificial credential escalation.

Courts and regulators shall construe ambiguity in favor of substance over credential and against financial extraction disguised as academic necessity.

⸻

Section 7. Enforcement and Remedies

Students and graduates shall have standing to challenge violations of this Article.

Courts may:

(a) void or reduce unenforceable educational debt;
(b) impose restitution or penalties for deceptive practices;
(c) enjoin predatory pricing or financing schemes.

No immunity, accreditation status, or institutional prestige shall bar enforcement.

⸻

Section 8. Construction

This Article shall be construed to:

(a) protect academic freedom and pluralism of inquiry;
(b) prevent financial exploitation and asymmetric deception;
(c) preserve voluntary risk-taking where informed and proportionate;
(d) discourage dependence on debt as a substitute for value.
