Article VI-I — Judicial Continuity and Emergency Function

Section 1. Purpose and Scope

This Subarticle establishes limited measures to preserve the continuous operation of the Judiciary during declared emergencies, catastrophic disruption, or temporary incapacity.

Judicial continuity exists to maintain constitutional adjudication, not to expand judicial authority or suspend rights.

⸻

Section 2. Constitutional Hierarchy

All continuity measures under this Subarticle operate subject to Article XV.

Nothing in this Subarticle shall authorize powers inconsistent with Article XV, Article XXXVI, or Article XXXVIII, according to their respective constitutional hierarchy.

Where a conflict is alleged, the construction that most restricts emergency authority shall control.

⸻

Section 3. Preservation of Judicial Review

At all times, including during emergencies:
	1.	access to courts shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable;
	2.	habeas corpus and core constitutional review shall not be suspended except as expressly permitted by this Constitution;
	3.	judicial independence and due process shall remain operative.

Emergency conditions shall not justify denial of judicial review.

⸻

Section 4. Temporary Operational Adjustments

During a declared emergency, courts may adopt temporary operational measures, including:
	1.	modified scheduling;
	2.	alternate locations;
	3.	remote proceedings where constitutionally permissible;
	4.	temporary reassignment of judges within existing courts.

Such measures shall be procedural only and shall not alter jurisdiction, remedies, or substantive rights.

⸻

Section 5. Prohibition on Emergency Courts and Extraordinary Tribunals

No emergency, provisional, or special tribunal shall be created outside the judicial structure established by this Constitution.

No court shall be vested with expanded jurisdiction, secrecy, or authority by virtue of an emergency.

Secret courts, secret law, or undisclosed adjudicatory bodies are prohibited.

⸻

Section 6. Non-Expansion and Anti-Laundering

Emergency or continuity measures shall not be used to:
	1.	expand judicial power;
	2.	consolidate authority;
	3.	bypass ordinary appointment, ethics, or removal requirements;
	4.	evade transparency or record-preservation obligations.

Any measure that persists beyond the termination of the emergency is void.


Section 7. Duration and Automatic Sunset

All continuity measures shall:
	1.	be expressly time-limited;
	2.	terminate automatically upon the expiration of the declared emergency;
	3.	be subject to periodic review where continued necessity is asserted.

Continuation without fresh authorization consistent with Article XV is prohibited.

Section 8. Transparency and Records

All actions taken pursuant to this Subarticle shall be documented and preserved as public records.

Emergency proceedings, orders, and administrative measures shall be disclosed promptly upon restoration of normal operations, subject only to narrow, time-limited protections consistent with Article VI-E and Article XXXIX.


Section 8A. Emergency Integrity Oversight

During any declared emergency, the Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have full authority to audit, inspect, and monitor all judicial continuity measures, emergency procedures, sealed proceedings, and continuity records.

Any concealment, obstruction, or abuse of emergency authority shall be immediately certified to the Constitutional Review Court and the Judicial Review Board.

Section 9. Accountability

Judicial officers and administrators who knowingly exceed the authority granted by this Subarticle shall be subject to discipline, removal, and liability as provided by this Constitution.

No immunity shall attach to intentional violations of continuity constraints.



Section 10. Interpretation

This Subarticle shall be interpreted to ensure that emergencies do not become a pretext for secrecy, exceptional justice, or permanent alteration of the judicial order.

The Judiciary shall remain a court of law, not a court of emergency.
