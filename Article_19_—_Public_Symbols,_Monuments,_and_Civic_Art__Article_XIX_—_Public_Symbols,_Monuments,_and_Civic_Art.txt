Article XIX — Public Symbols, Monuments, and Civic Art

Charge

This Article establishes constitutional principles governing the creation, display, maintenance, alteration, and removal of public symbols, monuments, and civic art under public authority. All such actions shall be conducted pursuant to lawful, transparent, and procedurally fair processes designed to ensure historical accuracy, public accountability, and equal treatment without ideological preference or partisan advantage. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to authorize arbitrary erasure, compelled endorsement, or unilateral executive action affecting public symbols absent authority and due process provided by law.

Legal Text

Section 1. Purpose and Scope

Public symbols, monuments, memorials, statues, murals, flags, seals, architectural features, and civic art placed or maintained by public authority exist to:

a. commemorate history truthfully;
b. honor sacrifice, service, and excellence;
c. transmit shared civic values;
d. elevate public spaces through beauty, meaning, and dignity.

This Article governs all such works funded, commissioned, displayed, maintained, or endorsed by public institutions at any level of government, including those on federal, state, or local property.

It applies to both permanent installations and those that become de facto permanent through prolonged display.

Section 2. Truthful Representation of History

Public monuments and symbols shall not falsify, sanitize, or deliberately distort historical truth.

Historical commemoration shall acknowledge complexity, including achievement and failure, heroism and wrongdoing, without propagandistic erasure or retroactive moral absolutism.

Where historical interpretation evolves with new evidence or scholarly consensus, contextualization—such as explanatory plaques, adjacent interpretive materials, or digital supplements—may be added.

Destruction, removal, concealment, or alteration shall not be the default remedy and requires the process set forth in Section 4.

Section 3. Prohibition of Tyrannical Glorification

No public symbol or monument shall glorify:

a. tyranny, totalitarianism, or mass atrocity;
b. regimes or movements dedicated to racial supremacy, ideological extermination, or the abolition of human dignity;
c. individuals whose primary legacy consists of crimes against humanity or deliberate destruction of the Republic.

This prohibition shall be applied narrowly and with evidentiary rigor, based on historical consensus and judicial findings, not ideological fashion or transient political pressure.

For purposes of this Section, historical consensus shall be demonstrated by a convergence of peer-reviewed scholarship, judicial findings, and primary historical evidence. Executive declaration, administrative guidance, or political resolution alone shall not constitute consensus.

Section 4. Protection of Lawful Historical Monuments — Removal, Alteration, and Restoration Process

No public monument, memorial, or civic artwork may be removed, destroyed, defaced, concealed, altered, or restored except through lawful process.

Such process shall require:

a. public notice and full disclosure of proposed changes, including historical rationale;
b. recorded deliberation by the appropriate governing body (local, state, or federal as applicable);
c. opportunity for public testimony and expert input;
d. a supermajority vote of two-thirds (⅔) of the full authorized membership of the governing body where the action is permanent;
e. judicial review for compliance with this Article upon challenge by any Civic Citizen or affected party.

Emergency removal or temporary protective measures shall be permitted only to prevent imminent physical harm or genuine public safety threats, with mandatory review and restoration consideration within ninety (90) days.

Where a monument has been unlawfully removed, altered, or concealed in violation of this Article or prior law, a symmetric supermajority process with identical procedural safeguards may order its restoration or rectification.

Section 5. Civic Art and Public Commissioning

Publicly commissioned art shall be selected through transparent processes emphasizing:

a. artistic merit and craftsmanship;
b. durability and suitability for public space;
c. contribution to civic dignity rather than provocation, nihilism, or partisan division;
d. respect for shared civic inheritance.

Public art shall not be used as a vehicle for partisan messaging, ideological coercion, or contempt for the People who fund and inhabit public spaces.

Selection processes shall be open, recorded, and subject to public oversight.

Section 6. Pluralism Without Fragmentation

The Republic affirms that its people arise from many traditions and inheritances.

Public symbols may reflect diverse contributions to the national story, provided such representation:

a. reinforces shared civic identity;
b. does not elevate subgroup identity above constitutional unity;
c. does not promote grievance as a civic virtue.

Pluralism shall strengthen cohesion, not replace it.

Section 7. Local Stewardship and Federal Restraint

Primary authority over public symbols and monuments rests with local and state governments, subject to the constraints of this Constitution.

The federal government shall not mandate removal, alteration, installation, or restoration of public symbols absent constitutional necessity or express statutory authorization consistent with Article XXVIII (Federalization of Sovereign Authority).

Federal funding shall not be conditioned upon ideological conformity in civic symbolism, nor withheld punitively for lawful state or local decisions regarding monuments or civic art.

Section 8. Cultural Heritage and Preservation

The Republic recognizes cultural, artistic, and architectural heritage as a form of national wealth.

Historic preservation, restoration, and conservation shall be encouraged as acts of stewardship.

Destruction motivated by political fashion, factional pressure, moral panic, or claims of necessity is prohibited.

Private philanthropy and voluntary maintenance may supplement public efforts, provided they comply with this Article and do not circumvent lawful process.

Section 9. Temporary Displays and Protest Expression

Temporary displays, protest art, or expressive installations shall be governed by content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions consistent with Article II (Rights, Liberties, and Personal Sovereignty).

Temporary expression shall not acquire permanent public status absent lawful commissioning and review under Section 5.

De facto permanence through neglect, administrative inaction, or political favoritism shall trigger mandatory review and either removal or formalization through lawful process.

Section 10. Protection Against Iconoclasm and Symbolic Vandalism

Willful destruction, defacement, or desecration of public monuments and civic art constitutes an offense against the Republic and shall be punishable as a crime under Article VII (Crime, Justice, and Penal Philosophy), with penalties scaled to severity of harm and intent.

No person shall be retroactively criminally liable for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, except where already prohibited by general criminal law.

Peaceful criticism, contextual critique, lawful advocacy for change, and non-destructive protest remain fully protected under Article II.

Section 11. No Aesthetic Central Planning

Nothing in this Article authorizes the state to impose a single artistic style, canon, or aesthetic doctrine.

Civic art shall emerge from excellence, craftsmanship, and meaning, not bureaucratic mandate or centralized ideological direction.

Section 12. Remedies, Enforcement, and Standing

Any Civic Citizen, lawful resident, or state with standing may challenge violations of this Article in court.

Remedies for unlawful actions include injunction, restoration, damages, and disgorgement of misused public funds.

Qualified immunity shall not shield intentional violations of this Article.

Enforcement shall align with Article XI (Transparency, Anti-Capture, and Public Stewardship) with respect to records access, disclosure, and accountability.

Section 13. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to favor:

a. truth over propaganda;
b. stewardship over erasure;
c. unity over faction;
d. dignity over shock;
e. continuity over ideological churn;
f. lawful process over unilateral action, whether for removal or restoration.

The Republic shall remember who it is, where it came from, and what it owes to those who came before—through honest commemoration, not selective forgetting or imposed revision.
