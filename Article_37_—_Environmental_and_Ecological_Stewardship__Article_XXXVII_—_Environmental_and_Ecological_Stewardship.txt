Article XXXVII — Environmental and Ecological Stewardship

Charge

A Republic that consumes its land, water, and air without restraint mortgages the future and betrays those not yet born.

Environmental stewardship is not ideology, superstition, or narrative — it is the rational preservation of the natural systems upon which life, agriculture, health, and civilization depend. This Article affirms a duty of care grounded in evidence, proportionality, intergenerational responsibility, and respect for individual rights.

Section 1. Duty of Stewardship

The Republic and its agents recognize an affirmative duty to preserve and protect land, water, air, soil, biodiversity, and ecological systems essential to human life, prosperity, and the rights of present and future generations.

This duty shall be legislative in character and supervisory in nature and shall be discharged through evidence-based measures enacted pursuant to legislative authority, with due regard for property rights, human flourishing, and the enforcement structures established elsewhere in this Constitution.
Neglect, waste, or predatory degradation of land, water, air, or ecological systems that materially harms the Republic or its posterity shall constitute a grave offense, subject to enforcement and sanction pursuant to Article VII, and shall be construed in harmony with the stewardship duties established in Article IX.
Ecological stewardship may include the restoration, cultivation, and transmission of native and historically adapted plant species, where such practices advance biodiversity, food resilience, and environmental stability, consistent with evidence and local conditions.

Section 2. Evidence Over Narrative

Environmental policy and enforcement shall be grounded in:

a. empirical observation, reproducible data, and falsifiable measurement;
b. transparent quantification of risk, harm, and benefit;
c. proportional response only to demonstrated, material harm or imminent threat that is reasonably certain and substantial, supported by clear and convincing evidence subject to adversarial testing and judicial review.
No policy, regulation, or restriction shall be justified by speculative modeling, ideological narrative, asserted consensus, precautionary assumptions absent material evidence, or fear of uncertain future harm.
Where scientific uncertainty exists, the presumption shall favor liberty, private property rights, family-scale production, and economic productivity unless clear and convincing evidence demonstrates an imminent and specific risk of serious harm, as defined by this Constitution.
Any restriction on land use, agriculture, energy production, or economic activity imposed pursuant to this Article shall be narrowly tailored, proportionate to demonstrated harm, and subject to timely judicial review.

Section 3. No Emergency Power Creation or Pretext

Environmental concerns shall not be invoked to:

a. suspend constitutional rights;
b. bypass legislative authority or ordinary due process;
c. justify permanent emergency powers, executive overreach, or delegation to unaccountable bodies;
d. impose blanket prohibitions or centralize authority beyond demonstrated necessity.
Environmental concerns shall not be used as pretext for fiscal coercion, demographic engineering, suppression of lawful competition, or the permanent expansion of governmental power absent demonstrable and specific harm.
All actions remain subject to full constitutional process, judicial review, and the lock clauses of Article XV.

Section 4. Balance with Human Needs and Property Rights

Stewardship shall be harmonized with and shall not unduly impair:

a. food production, homesteading, and agricultural duty (Article IX);
b. housing, infrastructure, mobility, and energy needs (Article XXIX and related provisions);
c. economic activity essential for human flourishing (Article VIII);
d. private property rights, absent just compensation for any taking.

Preservation shall not become a pretext for deprivation, stagnation, or domination of the People by the State.

Section 5. Remedies and Enforcement

Any person who demonstrates particularized, justiciable injury, including injury arising from provable intergenerational harm that is concrete, material, and supported by evidence, shall have standing to seek judicial relief for violations of this Article.

Remedies may include injunctions, restitution for proven damages, mandatory disclosure of data, or proportional corrective measures consistent with due process.
Standing shall include landholders, farmers, communities, and civic organizations that can demonstrate concrete, material injury supported by evidence.
Willful neglect or abuse of stewardship duties by officials shall constitute an impeachable offense and a violation of oath.


Section 5a. Federalism and Reserved Environmental Powers

States retain primary authority over traditional environmental matters within their borders, including land use, water allocation, and local pollution control, absent express constitutional delegation.

The federal government shall not commandeer state resources, impose regulatory schemes through conditional funding, or coerce state adoption of environmental policies, consistent with Article XXVIII.



Section 6. Construction

This Article shall be interpreted to:

a. favor long-term rational sustainability over short-term extraction or absolutist preservation;
b. prevent ideological or precautionary capture of environmental policy;
c. reject both reckless exploitation and unsubstantiated restriction;
d. bind the State to the same standards of evidence and proportionality it demands of the People;
e. ensure stewardship enhances, rather than undermines, the inviolable rights of the individual.

Section 7. Lock Designation
The following provisions of Article XXXVII are designated as Lock-Protected Provisions and may not be amended, repealed, suspended, or reinterpreted except by the supermajority procedures specified in Article XV:
	•	Section 2 — Evidence Over Narrative (entire section)
Rationale: To permanently prohibit environmental policy justified by ideology, speculative modeling, asserted consensus, or precautionary assumptions absent clear and convincing evidence.
	•	Section 3 — No Emergency Power Creation or Pretext (entire section)
Rationale: To prevent environmental claims from serving as a basis for emergency rule, suspension of rights, or permanent expansion of executive or administrative power.
	•	Section 6(b), (c), and (d) — Construction Safeguards
Rationale: To ensure environmental stewardship remains evidence-based, proportionate, non-ideological, and bound by the same constitutional standards imposed upon the People.
The lock-protected provisions of this Article shall be construed to constrain environmental authority, not to mandate any environmental policy outcome.
All other provisions of Article XXXVII remain amendable in accordance with this Constitution.
