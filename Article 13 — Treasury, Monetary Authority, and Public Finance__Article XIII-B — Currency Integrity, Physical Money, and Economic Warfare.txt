Section 2. Currency Integrity as a Constitutional Interest

The integrity of the Republic’s currency is a constitutional interest essential to liberty, commerce, and democratic self-government.

Any act that undermines confidence in lawful currency through concealment, manipulation, or coercion constitutes harm to the People.

Currency integrity shall be preserved through transparency, restraint, and accountability.

⸻

Section 3. Protection of Physical Currency

Physical currency shall remain lawful tender.

No law, regulation, or policy shall:
	1.	criminalize the possession or use of physical currency;
	2.	mandate exclusive reliance on digital or traceable instruments;
	3.	impose punitive fees, expiration, or geographic restrictions on cash;
	4.	condition access to essential goods or services on abandonment of physical currency.

The People retain the right to transact privately using lawful physical money.

	3.	enforce political, ideological, or social compliance;
	4.	expire, deactivate, or vary in value based on user characteristics.

Any digital currency authorized under Article XIII shall be voluntary, fungible, asset-backed where applicable, and equivalent in rights to physical currency.

Section 5. Anti-Sabotage and Anti-Debasement Doctrine

Intentional debasement, sabotage, or destabilization of the Republic’s currency constitutes economic warfare.

Acts of economic warfare include:
	1.	hidden inflation designed to transfer wealth without consent;
	2.	deliberate erosion of currency purchasing power;
	3.	manipulation of exchange mechanisms to conceal insolvency;
	4.	coordinated actions intended to collapse confidence in lawful money.

Any allegation of economic warfare, debasement, or concealed inflation under this Section shall be justiciable as of right before the Constitutional Review Court.

Section 6. Foreign Economic Warfare and Defense

The Republic shall defend against foreign economic warfare, including:
	1.	currency manipulation;
	2.	hostile capital flooding or extraction;
	3.	sanctions designed to coerce domestic political outcomes;
	4.	weaponization of payment systems or clearing infrastructure.

Defensive measures shall be proportional, transparent, and subject to constitutional oversight.


Section 6A. Foreign Confidence Exploitation and Industrial Fraud

Industrial-scale fraud, identity theft, and payment-rail exploitation directed at persons within the Republic constitute a form of foreign economic aggression when conducted:
	1.	at scale sufficient to undermine public trust or inflict systemic harm;
	2.	with the direction, material support, or operational control of a foreign state; or
	3.	under knowing protection, shelter, or willful non-enforcement by a foreign jurisdiction after formal notice and reasonable opportunity to act.

The Republic shall treat such operations as hostile economic conduct and shall respond through lawful, targeted measures, including:
	1.	extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction for offenses against persons within the Republic, subject to due process;
	2.	asset freezes, forfeiture after conviction, restitution enforcement, and civil recovery mechanisms prioritized to victims;
	3.	targeted sanctions, visa bans, and financial interdiction against operators, facilitators, front entities, and materially supportive institutions;
	4.	payment-system, telecommunications, and identity-infrastructure defenses and interdictions, with clear rules, auditability, and narrow tailoring;
	5.	formal designation of non-cooperative safe-harbor jurisdictions, with escalatory countermeasures defined by law.

Congress shall, by law, maximize victim recovery and deterrence without creating new generalized surveillance powers or speech restrictions. In carrying out this Section, Congress shall prioritize structural defenses that make scams harder and more expensive to run at scale, and may require, at minimum:
	1.	a free, simple, single-credential mechanism to place and lift fraud locks on credit reporting and major payment accounts, with strong authentication and reasonable delay or step-up verification to prevent rapid abuse;
	2.	a distinct felony offense for knowing recruitment, management, or operation of money-mule networks and laundering rails used primarily for confidence-exploitation proceeds, with forfeiture of instrumentalities and victim restitution priority;
	3.	enhanced enterprise liability for coordinated confidence-exploitation operations, including predicate offenses and civil recovery mechanisms sufficient to reach organizers, facilitators, and materially supportive intermediaries;
	4.	carrier-level and gateway-level duties to authenticate caller identity, suppress spoofing, and block or rate-limit high-risk traffic after notice, with civil liability for willful or repeated transmission of non-authenticated fraudulent traffic;
	5.	felony penalties for trafficking in victim lists, stolen credentials, or access instruments used primarily to facilitate confidence exploitation, and lawful freezing procedures for clearly attributable proceeds, subject to due process;
	6.	a national victim restitution and recovery framework, including a compensation fund seeded by forfeited proceeds and governed by transparent rules that prioritize repayment to victims before fines or agency budgets.

All measures under this Section shall remain proportional, transparent to the maximum extent consistent with operational necessity, and subject to constitutional oversight, record preservation, and auditability under Articles XI and XIII.

Nothing in this Section shall be construed to compel universal real-name identity for private communications, mandate biometric enrollment for ordinary speech or association, require backdoors into end-to-end encryption, or authorize mass monitoring of private communications absent individualized suspicion and judicial process.

Nothing in this Section shall be construed to authorize war, invasion, assassination, or use of military force absent the explicit war and defense authorities, procedures, and limitations elsewhere in this Constitution.

Section 7. Prohibition on Parallel or Fragmenting Currencies

No public authority shall authorize or tolerate parallel currencies that:
	1.	fragment the monetary unit of account;
	2.	function as employer or locality-controlled scrip;
	3.	undermine wage fungibility or free exit;
	4.	create dependency or coercive economic zones.
The validity of any currency, clearing system, or digital instrument governed by this Section shall be determined in the first instance by the Constitutional Review Court, subject to appellate or discretionary review by the Supreme Court of the Republic; CRC determinations shall be final if the Supreme Court declines review, unless the Constitutional Review Court certifies that the matter requires appellate consideration.This Section does not prohibit voluntary private exchange systems permitted under Article VIII-A or lawful alternatives recognized under Article X-A, provided they do not impersonate public currency or coerce participation.

⸻

Section 8. Clearing, Settlement, and Systemic Neutrality

Payment clearing and settlement systems operating within the Republic shall be neutral, auditable, and non-discriminatory.

No clearing system may deny service, delay settlement, or impose penalties based on lawful speech, political belief, or non-economic status.

Systemic neutrality is mandatory infrastructure.

⸻

Section 9. Emergency Constraints

No emergency, crisis, or continuity doctrine shall be used to:
	1.	suspend physical currency protections;
	2.	impose mandatory digital currency adoption;
	3.	authorize coercive programmability;
	4.	conceal fiscal or monetary actions.

Emergency monetary actions shall be temporary, narrowly tailored, and fully disclosed.

⸻

Section 10. Records, Transparency, and Audit

All actions affecting currency issuance, integrity, debasement risk, clearing systems, or defensive measures against economic warfare shall be preserved as public records.

Claims of secrecy or market sensitivity shall not defeat constitutional accountability.

This Section operates in coordination with Articles XI and XXXIX.

⸻

Section 11. Enforcement and Severity

Willful violation of this Article by public officials, monetary authorities, or institutions constitutes abuse of the public trust.

Where such conduct involves concealment, coercion, or systemic harm, it shall qualify as a grave offense under Article 0 and be subject to Tier-3 escalation.

⸻

Section 12. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to ensure that money remains a tool of exchange rather than an instrument of control.

Where doubt exists, the construction that preserves fungibility, privacy, and voluntary participation shall control.
