Article II — Rights, Liberties, And Personal Sovereignty

Charge
This Article defines the legal status, duties, and protections of citizenship and allegiance within the Republic. Citizenship shall constitute a binding legal relationship governed by reciprocal rights and obligations. Allegiance to the Republic shall be exclusive, voluntary, and enforceable as provided by law. All statutes and administrative actions under this Article shall be construed to preserve national sovereignty, civic responsibility, and equal application of the law.

Section 0. Constitutional Construction, Supremacy, and Enforcement

(a) Self-Executing Rights

All rights secured by this Article are self-executing, immediately enforceable, and binding upon all branches, officers, courts, agencies, contractors, and instrumentalities of the Republic, federal, state, and subordinate alike.

No implementing legislation, appropriation, rulemaking, or administrative action shall be required for their effect, and no authority may delay, condition, narrow, suspend, or ration their enforcement absent express authorization in this Constitution.

No emergency, national security declaration, treaty, or international obligation shall suspend or override the operation of this Article.

(b) Interpretive Supremacy

This Article shall be construed in harmony with Article 0 (Global Definitions and Rules of Interpretation) and Article XXVI (Charter of Inviolable Rights).

Where any ambiguity, silence, conflict, or tension exists, interpretation shall favor the maximum preservation of individual liberty, bodily integrity, conscience, privacy, due process, and freedom from coercion.

No inference of governmental power shall be drawn from silence, implication, tradition, or historical practice.

(c) Prohibition on Judicial Balancing and Deference

No court shall subject the rights secured by this Article to ad hoc balancing tests, interest-weighing frameworks, rational-basis review, intermediate scrutiny, cost–benefit analysis, claims of administrative convenience, asserted expertise, national security, emergency declarations, or institutional deference, except where this Constitution expressly and unambiguously so permits.

No doctrine of “political question,” “deference,” “standing,” “ripeness,” “qualified immunity,” “sovereign immunity,” or “harmless error” may be used to avoid enforcement of these rights.

(d) Burden of Justification

Where this Article permits restraint of liberty, the burden of proof rests entirely upon the government.

Such restraint shall be upheld only upon clear and convincing evidence, narrowly tailored to a compelling and lawful constitutional purpose, and employing the least restrictive means available.

Economic convenience, administrative efficiency, political expedience, public opinion, or institutional preference shall not constitute compelling interest.

(e) Anti-Evasion Rule

No authority may evade the protections of this Article by reclassification, relabeling, indirect structuring, delegation, outsourcing, privatization, or Pretextual Coercion (as defined in Article 0), including but not limited to characterizing restraints as civil, administrative, medical, regulatory, protective, preventive, or non-punitive where their effect burdens liberty, bodily autonomy, movement, conscience, speech, association, or due process.

Private actors acting under color of law, contract, license, delegation, algorithmic enforcement, or regulatory compulsion shall be treated as state actors for purposes of this Article.

(f) Voidness of Contrary Law or Judgment

Any statute, regulation, executive action, policy, treaty, international agreement, judicial doctrine, or judgment inconsistent with this Article is void to the extent of the conflict and shall be denied force or effect.

Courts shall provide immediate relief, including injunction, suppression of evidence, dismissal, and damages, to any person whose rights under this Article are violated.

Section 1. Fundamental Liberties of Thought, Expression, and Association

All lawful residents possess inherent liberties which may be limited only through due process, and only where necessary to protect life, dignity, or public safety. No limitation may be imposed for political, ideological, administrative, economic, or reputational convenience.

These liberties include:

(a) freedom of conscience, belief, disbelief, inquiry, conversion, and religious practice;
(b) freedom of speech, expression, writing, art, press, and symbolic communication;
(c) freedom of peaceful assembly and association;
(d) freedom of movement within the Republic;
(e) freedom from arbitrary arrest, coercion, or detention;
(f) freedom from involuntary medical treatment except through lawful due process;
(g) freedom from forced labor except as lawful punishment after conviction.

No government entity may abridge or compel these freedoms except as expressly permitted herein. No private entity acting under contract, license, regulation, or coercion of the state may do so on its behalf.

Section 1A. Judicial Duty, Timely Review, and Relief

(a) Non-Discretionary Jurisdiction
No court may decline, postpone, abstain from, or refuse to adjudicate a claim alleging violation of this Article on grounds of standing limitation, ripeness, mootness, political question, institutional competence, docket congestion, comity, or prudential discretion. No claim may be dismissed or delayed due to treaty, national security, or emergency declaration.

(b) Expedited Review Requirement
Claims alleging deprivation of liberty, bodily autonomy, detention, search, seizure, compelled treatment, or suppression of expression under this Article shall receive expedited judicial review as follows:
	•	Initial judicial hearing — within 24 hours of filing or detention, whichever occurs first;
	•	Written findings on legality — within 72 hours of the hearing;
	•	Final determination — within 7 days, absent extraordinary circumstances expressly found on the record.

(c) Habeas and Custodial Claims
Any person restrained of liberty shall be entitled to immediate habeas review. Failure to provide judicial review within the timelines specified herein shall result in automatic interim release, subject only to conditions strictly necessary to prevent imminent and specific harm.

(d) Search and Seizure Challenges
Motions challenging searches, seizures, or data access under this Article shall be heard within 5 days of filing. Evidence obtained or retained without timely judicial validation shall be suppressed unless expressly admissible under Section 2 of this Article.

(e) Prohibition on Indefinite Stay
No stay, injunction, or deferral of relief may extend beyond 14 days unless affirmed by a higher court with written findings demonstrating constitutional necessity. Serial or rolling stays are prohibited.

(f) Automatic Relief for Delay
Where a court or authority fails to act within the timelines required by this Section, the claimant shall be entitled to immediate interim relief, including suppression of evidence, release from restraint, or compelled disclosure, pending final adjudication.

(g) Personal Accountability
Knowing or reckless failure by any judge, official, or officer to comply with the duties imposed by this Section constitutes constitutional misconduct and shall subject the responsible party to discipline, removal, and liability as provided elsewhere in this Constitution.

Section 1B. Standing, Justiciability, and Access
(a) Guaranteed Standing
Any person alleging a violation or credible threat of violation of this Article shall have standing to sue. No showing of special injury, exhaustion of remedies, exhaustion of administrative process, or prior denial shall be required.

(b) Credible Threat Standard
Standing exists where a policy, practice, regulation, directive, or pattern of conduct creates a reasonable likelihood of future violation. Persons need not await arrest, detention, punishment, or harm to seek relief.

(c) Prohibition on Standing Doctrines as Barriers
No court may deny standing, dismiss a claim, or limit relief under doctrines of generalized grievance, third-party standing, taxpayer standing, prudential limitation, or similar judicially created barriers.

(d) Associational Standing
Organizations may bring suit on behalf of affected persons where such persons face practical barriers to litigation or risk retaliation, intimidation, or suppression.

Section 1C. Individual Accountability

(a) No Immunity for Constitutional Violations
No officer, employee, contractor, agent, or delegate of the Republic shall enjoy immunity—qualified, absolute, sovereign, official, or otherwise—for knowing, reckless, or negligent violations of this Article.

(b) Color of Law Defined Broadly
Liability attaches to any person acting under color of law, authority, delegation, contract, or de facto power, regardless of formal employment or organizational status.

(c) Supervisory and Systemic Liability
Supervisors, policymakers, and commanding officials are liable where violations result from policy, training failure, tolerated practice, willful blindness, or systemic design.

(d) No Defense of Orders or Automation
Superior orders, institutional policy, emergency declaration, algorithmic mediation, or automated decision systems shall not excuse liability nor shall treaty obligation, international law, or intergovernmental agreement.

Section 1D. Remedies

(a) Mandatory Relief
Upon a finding of violation, courts shall grant effective relief sufficient to terminate the violation, prevent recurrence, and restore the injured party as nearly as possible to their prior position.

(b) Available Remedies Include
Relief shall include, as appropriate:
	•	declaratory judgment;
	•	injunctive relief;
	•	suppression or exclusion of evidence;
	•	release from detention or restraint;
	•	rescission of unlawful orders or policies;
	•	restoration of rights, licenses, status, or property;
	•	compensatory damages;
	•	statutory damages where quantification is impracticable.

(c) No Harmless-Error Escape
Violations of this Article shall not be excused as harmless where they burden liberty, bodily autonomy, privacy, due process, or expressive freedom nor may courts decline relief on grounds that the outcome would have been the same.

(d) Structural Injunctions Permitted
Where violations arise from policy, practice, or system design, courts may order structural remedies narrowly tailored to achieve compliance.

Section 1E. Attorney Fees and Costs

(a) Fee-Shifting Mandated
Any prevailing claimant under this Article shall be awarded reasonable attorney fees, expert costs, and litigation expenses.

(b) Government Pays
Fees and damages shall be paid by the offending agency or authority, not from the personal recovery of the injured party.

(c) Personal Contribution Permitted
Where a violation is knowing or reckless, courts may order partial personal contribution by responsible officials.

(d) No Bond or Security Requirement
No claimant enforcing this Article shall be required to post bond or security as a condition of injunctive or declaratory relief.

Section 2. Privacy, Data Integrity, and Search Protections

All persons possess the right to privacy, encryption, and security against unreasonable search and seizure. No person may be compelled to decrypt, disclose, or provide passwords, cryptographic keys, biometric identifiers, or authentication credentials to access their data, except through a warrant issued upon probable cause for a specific device or account.

(a) Lawful Access

Searches of data, property, or communications require a judicial warrant supported by evidence. 
No search or surveillance may be conducted under foreign intelligence, national security, counterterrorism, or treaty authority without full compliance with this Section.
Such warrants shall be particularized to the person, place, account, or device to be searched and shall not authorize bulk collection, general warrants, dragnet surveillance, or exploratory data fishing.
Illegally obtained evidence is admissible only for heinous crimes, including murder, rape, molestation, trafficking, exploitation, or comparable offenses.
Officers who unlawfully obtain such evidence shall be prosecuted separately.
No derivative evidence, intelligence, or investigative lead obtained through unlawful access may be admitted, used, or retained, except under the heinous-crime exception of this Section.
(b) Proportionality

Intrusions must be narrowly tailored, evidence-based, and proportionate to the threat posed, and shall never be used for political, ideological, or personal retribution.

(c) Lesser Offenses
For non-heinous crimes, unlawfully obtained evidence shall be excluded.
(d) Evidentiary Classification Lock
The classification of an offense as heinous or non-heinous for purposes of admissibility under this Section shall be governed exclusively by the definitions set forth in Article VII.
No court may expand, contract, or analogize such classification beyond the express constitutional text.
No secret court, classified tribunal, or special national security body may alter or override this classification.


Section 2A. Limits on Detention and Apprehension

(a) Presumption of Liberty
All persons are presumed free. Any detention, apprehension, confinement, or restraint of movement constitutes a deprivation of liberty and shall be treated as such regardless of label or asserted purpose.

(b) Judicial Authorization Required
No person may be detained or apprehended absent a judicial warrant or order supported by sworn evidence establishing individualized probable cause of a crime or, where expressly permitted, imminent and specific risk of serious harm.
Detention may not be justified solely by immigration status, material-witness designation, risk of flight, or administrative convenience.

(c) Temporary Emergency Holds
	•	Temporary, non-consensual holds ... may occur only where: 
	•	an Imminent and Specific Risk of serious harm (as defined in Article 0) is present; 
	•	no less restrictive means are reasonably available;
	•	the hold is strictly time-limited and non-punitive; and
	•	judicial review is obtained within 24 hours.

(d) Maximum Duration
Absent criminal charge or express constitutional authorization, no non-consensual hold may exceed 72 hours. Continued restraint beyond that period requires a formal judicial order issued after an adversarial hearing.  Successive or renewed holds based on the same or substantially similar facts are prohibited.

(e) Prohibition on Preventive Detention by Reclassification
No authority may impose detention or restraint by recharacterizing it as civil commitment, protective custody, public health measure, administrative hold, welfare intervention, psychiatric diagnosis, behavioral assessment, algorithmic risk scoring, or similar designation where the effect is deprivation of liberty.

(f) Automatic Release for Noncompliance
Failure to meet the requirements of this Section results in immediate release and bars re-detention on the same factual basis absent materially new evidence.
No person released under this Section may be transferred, deported, or surrendered to any foreign or private authority for the purpose of continuing the same detention.

Section 3 — Defense, Arms, and Civic Responsibility

The right of the People to keep, bear, acquire, manufacture, modify, possess, and carry arms for lawful defense of self, others, community, and the Republic is inherent, fundamental, and shall not be infringed.

This right exists prior to the state and is necessary to preserve liberty, deter tyranny, resist invasion, suppress criminal violence, and secure the continuity of constitutional order.

(a) Arms as a Civic Right and Duty

The defense of the Republic is a shared civic responsibility.
The People shall not be disarmed, rendered dependent, or left defenseless.

The exercise of the right to arms includes:
• individual self-defense,
• mutual defense,
• community protection,
• resistance to unlawful force,
• and defense against foreign or domestic enemies.

The Republic shall maintain a broadly armed and trained population sufficient to deter invasion, subversion, mass violence, and tyranny.

(b) Voluntary Arms Guilds and Mutual Accountability

To promote safety, training, coordination, and accountability, the People have the right to organize, join, and operate arms guilds, including:

• militia units,
• certified gun clubs,
• hunting or sporting associations,
• private security cooperatives,
• neighborhood defense associations,
• or equivalent lawful defensive organizations.

These associations exist to:
• provide training and certification,
• encourage safe handling and storage,
• promote ethical defensive use,
• and provide mutual accountability.

Membership in such organizations shall never be a condition of exercising the right to keep and bear arms.

If the state fails to support, recognize, or protect lawful arms guilds, or if such organizations become inaccessible, suppressed, or captured, the right to individual arms ownership and carry remains fully operative and unimpaired.

No government action or inaction may be used to convert this right into a privilege.

(c) Background Exclusions (Narrow and Temporary)

Restrictions on arms possession may exclude only:

• persons convicted of Tier Three (grave) offenses,
• repeat violent offenders,
• persons currently meeting the definition of Severe, Dangerous Mental Illness under Article 0, based on clear and convincing evidence and two independent evaluations,
• or persons with verified operational ties to enemies of the Republic.

All exclusions based on mental or behavioral condition:
• shall be temporary,
• shall be subject to periodic judicial review,
• and shall include a clear and mandatory restoration pathway upon cessation of qualifying risk.

No permanent disability may be imposed without full due process under Section 5.

(d) Training, Education, and Public Competence

The People have a constitutional right to learn the safe, effective, and ethical use of arms.

The public education system shall include age-appropriate, opt-out-capable instruction in:
• firearm safety,
• lawful self-defense,
• emergency response,
• and civic defense.

Training may be required only for weapons requiring advanced technical skill, not as a precondition for ordinary possession or carry.

No lack of training, income, or institutional access may be used to deny the right of defense.

(e) Weapons of Extreme Mass Destruction

Weapons whose inherent nature makes proportionate, discriminating, or containable use impossible are prohibited without exception, including:

• nuclear weapons,
• radiological weapons,
• biological weapons,
• uncontrollable chemical agents,
• and devices whose foreseeable effects would cause indiscriminate mass death or irreversible ecological devastation.

No other class of arms may be prohibited.

There shall be no bans on:
• ammunition,
• magazine capacity,
• calibers,
• assistive devices,
• optics,
• stabilizers,
• suppressors,
• or lawful modifications.

(f) Robotics, Autonomous Systems, and Advanced Platforms

Robotic, autonomous, cyber-physical, or intelligent systems are not weapons per se.

Where such systems are configured or deployed as platforms for lethal or coercive force, they shall be regulated as arms platforms in proportion to:

• lethality,
• autonomy,
• range,
• and capacity for harm,

with requirements including:
	•	human command responsibility,
	•	licensing proportional to destructive potential,
	•	training and certification,
	•	traceable ownership,
	•	and full civil and criminal liability for misuse.

No autonomous system shall be deemed a weapon of mass destruction unless its payload or intended use independently meets that definition.

(g) Stand-Your-Ground and Good-Faith Defense

The People have the right to stand their ground in lawful places and to use proportionate force to defend self or others from unlawful violence.

No person acting in good faith to stop violent crime, terrorism, or imminent harm shall be criminally or civilly punished absent proof of malicious or reckless misuse.

Good-Samaritan protections apply to lawful defensive use of arms.

(h) Due Process in Risk-Based Restrictions

Any temporary restriction based on alleged risk or incapacity shall comply fully with Sections 2A and 4A of this Article.

No administrative suspension, delay, or revocation shall occur without:
• a prior judicial order,
• an adversarial hearing,
• clear and convincing evidence,
• and an expedited right of appeal.

(i) Temporary Risk Orders

Courts may impose temporary arms restrictions only where an individual poses an Imminent and Specific Risk of serious harm as defined in Article 0.

Such orders:
• shall not exceed 180 days without renewal,
• shall be narrowly tailored,
• and shall be immediately lifted upon cessation of risk.

No permanent deprivation may occur without full constitutional due process.

Section 4. Bodily Autonomy and Medical Integrity

No person shall be compelled to surrender bodily autonomy without grave, evidence-based justification and due process.

(a) Core Protections

This Section protects all persons against:
	•	forced medical procedures;
	•	involuntary experimentation;
	•	denial of necessary medical care;
	•	ideological, political, moral, demographic, or non-therapeutic procedures imposed on any person, including minors.

(b) Necessary Abortions

A necessary abortion is permitted only when:
	•	the life of the mother is at risk;
	•	the child will be stillborn; or
	•	the child will be born with no or extremely low quality of life.

Elective abortions must occur prior to detection of a fetal heartbeat unless approved by a state-appointed medical and ethical review panel operating under transparent, evidence-based criteria.

(c) Limitation

Nothing in this Section shall be construed to protect self-harm or medically unnecessary mutilation.

(d) High Evidentiary Threshold for Forced Intervention

No person may be subjected to involuntary medical treatment... unless the government establishes, by clear and convincing evidence, that the individual lacks decisional capacity and poses an Imminent and Specific Risk of serious harm (as defined in Article 0) that cannot be mitigated by less restrictive means.

(e) Independent Medical Evaluation

Any claim of incapacity shall require evaluation by two independent, licensed medical professionals, neither of whom may be employed by, contracted with, or subordinate to the detaining or petitioning authority.

(f) Judicial Determination Required

Findings of incapacity or authorization of non-consensual intervention shall have no legal effect absent a judicial determination entered on the record.

Emergency interventions undertaken without prior judicial order shall expire automatically within twenty-four (24) hours unless judicially affirmed.

(g) Strict Temporal Limits

Any judicial order authorizing involuntary treatment or confinement shall:
	•	specify a fixed expiration date not exceeding fourteen (14) days;
	•	be renewable only upon fresh evidence and renewed judicial findings; and
	•	never be indefinite or open-ended.

(h) Restoration Pathway

All orders issued under this Section shall include a clear and enforceable pathway for restoration of liberty upon demonstration of decisional capacity or mitigation of risk.

The burden of continued restraint shall rest at all times with the State.

(i) Absolute Prohibition on Ideological or Non-Therapeutic Justifications

No intervention, treatment, confinement, or bodily intrusion may be justified on ideological, political, moral, demographic, social, or conformity-based grounds, nor for purposes of normalization, belief correction, or social engineering.
(j) Prohibition on Fiscal Disarmament
The right to keep and bear arms shall not be burdened, discouraged, or suppressed through taxation, fees, insurance mandates, licensing charges, or financial conditions.

No tax, excise, surcharge, registration fee, or monetary requirement may be imposed on:
• the ownership,
• possession,
• carry,
• manufacture,
• transfer,
• training,
• or lawful use of arms or ammunition,

beyond ordinary, generally applicable sales taxes imposed on all goods.

No financial barrier may be used to render the right to self-defense inaccessible, impractical, or conditional.
(k) Definition of Arms

For purposes of this Constitution, “arms” means any tool, device, or system capable of being used for lawful personal, community, or national defense, including weapons, tools, and defensive technologies of any form or era.

No law may evade this right by reclassifying arms as tools, devices, consumer products, controlled items, or by semantic relabeling.

The substance of defensive capability, not the label, governs.

Section 5 — Due Process and Fair Trial

No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property except through lawful, transparent, and constitutionally valid judicial proceedings.

Due process is not merely procedural formality but a substantive guarantee of justice, fairness, speed, and enforceable remedy.

(a) Fundamental Trial Rights

Every accused person is guaranteed:

• timely and specific notice of charges;
• access to all exculpatory and inculpatory evidence;
• competent legal representation;
• the presumption of innocence;
• the right to remain silent;
• the right to confront and challenge witnesses and evidence;
• the right to a public trial by an impartial jury;
• and the right to appeal.

No evidence obtained through coercion, deception, unlawful search, or rights violations shall be admissible.

(b) Timeliness as Due Process

Justice delayed is justice denied.

Proceedings shall occur within the strict time limits established by this Article and related Articles.

Unjustified delay by the state constitutes a constitutional violation and entitles the injured party to:
• dismissal where appropriate,
• release from custody,
• compensation,
• and recovery of attorney fees.

(c) Remedies Are Integral to Due Process

Any process that denies meaningful, enforceable remedy for a proven rights violation is itself unconstitutional.

Courts shall have the affirmative duty to restore rights, reverse unlawful outcomes, and compensate injury.

(d) Habeas Corpus

The right to habeas corpus is absolute except as expressly and narrowly permitted by this Constitution.

No person may be held without the right to immediate judicial review of the lawfulness of detention.

(e) Bail and Pretrial Detention

All persons are presumed eligible for release pending trial.

Detention without bail is permitted only upon a judicial finding, by clear and convincing evidence after an adversarial hearing, that the person is:
• a violent threat,
• dangerously mentally incapacitated under Article 0,
• or a demonstrated flight risk.

Preventive detention may not be used as punishment, leverage, or convenience.

(f) Property and Asset Seizure

No property shall be seized except pursuant to a judicial warrant supported by probable cause.

Forfeiture requires:
• criminal conviction,
• exhaustion of appeals,
• and proof that the property itself was an instrumentality of the crime.

Wrongful seizure or forfeiture requires full restitution, damages, and costs.

(g) Prohibition on Parallel Justice Systems

No foreign, religious, private, corporate, or administrative tribunal may exercise coercive judicial power or override constitutional courts.

All adjudication affecting life, liberty, or property must be subject to full constitutional due process and judicial review.

(h) Equality of Testimony and Standing

All lawful residents possess equal standing before the law.

Testimony, evidence, and legal rights shall not be discounted, weighted, or disfavored on the basis of sex, ancestry, creed, status, or identity.

Section 5A — Pretrial Liberty and Bail

(a) Default to Release

Pretrial detention is disfavored.
Release on the least restrictive conditions sufficient to ensure appearance and public safety is the constitutional default.

No person shall be jailed solely because of inability to pay money bail.

(b) Narrow Grounds for Detention Without Bail

Detention without bail may occur only upon a judicial finding, supported by clear and convincing evidence after an adversarial hearing, that the individual:
	•	poses a specific and credible threat of serious violence; or
	•	presents a demonstrable and substantial flight risk.

Generalized fear, prior arrests, poverty, or speculative risk shall not suffice.

(c) Strict Time Limits

No person may be held in pretrial detention longer than:

• 30 days for ordinary offenses, or
• 60 days for grave offenses,

without commencement of trial.

Continuances, docket congestion, prosecutorial delay, or administrative backlog shall not toll or extend these limits.

Upon expiration, the person shall be immediately released on recognizance or non-custodial conditions.

(d) Prohibition on Coercive Detention

Pretrial detention shall not be used to induce or pressure:
• plea agreements,
• cooperation,
• confessions,
• or waiver of rights.

Any such use constitutes a constitutional violation requiring:
• immediate release,
• suppression of tainted evidence,
• and appropriate sanctions.

Section 6 — Equal Protection of the Law

All lawful residents stand equal before the law and are entitled to the same rights, protections, burdens, and remedies.

No person or class of persons may be favored, burdened, prosecuted, punished, protected, or exempted differently by the state on account of:

• ancestry,
• creed,
• sex,
• national origin,
• economic status,
• political belief,
• tribal identity,
• or lawful immigration status.

(a) Equal Application and Enforcement

Laws shall be applied and enforced uniformly.

Selective enforcement, selective non-enforcement, differential charging, or differential punishment based on protected characteristics is a constitutional violation.

(b) Equal Access to Rights and Remedies

All lawful residents possess equal standing to:
• assert rights,
• bring suit,
• seek protection,
• and obtain remedies.

No person may be denied or granted special legal status or immunity based on protected characteristics.

(c) Political Rights

Political rights may be limited only as expressly provided elsewhere in this Constitution and shall never be abridged through discrimination or indirect exclusion.

Section 7 — Prohibition of Slavery and Human Trafficking

Slavery, ownership of persons, and involuntary servitude are forbidden.

No human being may be treated as property, merchandise, or transferable labor.

(a) Restorative Penal Servitude

Following criminal conviction, a court may impose time-limited restorative labor as an alternative to incarceration for the purpose of:
• compensating victims,
• repairing social harm,
• or supporting rehabilitation.

Such restorative labor:
• shall not exceed seven years,
• shall be imposed only by judicial sentence,
• shall be conducted under humane conditions,
• shall include fair compensation or credit toward restitution,
• and shall never be sold, leased, or assigned to private parties.

(b) Heinous and Incorrigible Offenders

Persons convicted of Tier-Three or other grave violent crimes, or who refuse rehabilitation, may be:
• incarcerated,
• or assigned to secure, state-supervised labor programs,

for periods exceeding seven years, including life where constitutionally permitted.

Such confinement or labor:
• is not restitutionary servitude,
• shall not create property interests in the person,
• shall not be exploited for private profit,
• and shall remain subject to human dignity and constitutional oversight.

(c) Absolute Prohibition of Trafficking

Human trafficking, sexual exploitation, forced labor, coerced marriage, debt bondage, and trade in persons are among the gravest constitutional crimes.

No consent obtained through force, fraud, coercion, deception, or abuse of vulnerability shall be recognized.

Section 8 — Quartering, Requisition, and Property Integrity

No soldier, police officer, agent, or official of the state may be quartered, housed, stationed, or billeted in any private dwelling without the voluntary consent of the occupant.

(a) Emergency Requisition

In true emergencies, the temporary use of private property may occur only where strictly necessary to prevent imminent loss of life or catastrophic harm, and only under the following conditions:

• just compensation,
• narrow scope,
• temporary duration,
• and prompt judicial or legislative oversight.

All requisitioned property shall be returned in equivalent condition or compensated in full.

(b) Prohibition on Emergency Takings

No emergency, disaster, war, or crisis shall be used to justify permanent seizure, confiscation, or transfer of private property without full constitutional due process.

(c) Asset Forfeiture and Property Seizure

No property shall be forfeited, seized, or retained by the state absent:
• criminal conviction,
• exhaustion of appeals,
• and proof that the property itself was an instrumentality of the crime.

Civil asset forfeiture is prohibited.

(d) Eminent Domain

Private property may be taken for genuine public use only after:
• judicial determination of necessity,
• full due process,
• and advance payment of just compensation.

No taking for private development, revenue generation, or political favoritism shall be permitted.

Section 9 — Prohibition of Cruel or Excessive Punishment

Excessive bail, excessive fines, and cruel, degrading, or disproportionate punishment are forbidden.

Punishment shall serve justice, public safety, and rehabilitation, not cruelty, revenge, or spectacle.

(a) Proportional and Scaled Fines

Fines shall be proportionate to both:
• the gravity of the offense, and
• the financial means of the offender.

No fine may be imposed in a manner that:
• destroys basic livelihood,
• creates debt bondage,
• or functions as indirect imprisonment.

(b) Conditions of Confinement

No punishment or confinement shall involve:
• torture,
• degrading treatment,
• medical abuse,
• sensory deprivation,
• or conditions intended to break the human will.

All persons, including prisoners, retain human dignity and constitutional protection.

(c) Dangerous or Incapacitated Persons

Persons who pose a continuing and extreme danger due to:
• severe violent pathology, or
• irreversible mental incapacity

may be confined only under:
• full judicial process,
• periodic review,
• and the least restrictive conditions consistent with public safety.

Preventive confinement shall never become permanent punishment without conviction.

Section 10 — Reserved and Unenumerated Rights

All rights not expressly and lawfully delegated to government remain with the People.

The enumeration of rights in this Constitution shall not be construed to deny, disparage, or limit other rights retained by the People.

(a) Natural Rights Presumption

All persons possess inherent rights arising from human dignity, liberty, and conscience, whether or not those rights are explicitly listed.

Government bears the burden of proving constitutional authority to restrict any liberty.

(b) Prohibition on Rights Erosion

No branch of government may:
• redefine,
• narrow,
• condition,
• or indirectly extinguish
any right, enumerated or unenumerated.

Absence of textual enumeration shall never be construed as absence of right.

(c) Judicial Duty

Courts shall interpret this Constitution in favor of liberty where ambiguity exists.

Any doubt shall be resolved against the expansion of state power.

Section 11. Freedom of Information and Public Transparency

The People possess a constitutional right to access public records and communications of government, subject only to narrow judicially approved restrictions for:

(a) national security,
(b) active investigations,
(c) protection of vulnerable individuals.
(d) Judicial Enforcement and Deadlines

Petitions seeking access to public records under this Section shall be adjudicated within 10 days of filing. Failure to justify withholding within that period results in automatic disclosure. No court may extend secrecy absent specific written findings of imminent and concrete harm, and any such extension shall expire automatically within 30 days.
(e) Enforcement and Penalties

Knowing obstruction, concealment, destruction, falsification, or delay of records subject to this Section constitutes a constitutional violation and a grave offense. Civil liability, removal from office, and criminal referral are mandatory upon proof.
Secrecy shall be time-limited, justified, reviewable, and never used to conceal corruption.
Destruction or falsification of records is a constitutional crime.
Standing to sue is guaranteed.

(f). Absolute Limits on Secrecy and Classification

(a) Maximum Duration of Secrecy
No public record, communication, dataset, directive, intelligence product, analysis, or material subject to this Constitution may be classified, withheld, sealed, or otherwise denied public access for a period exceeding twenty-five (25) years from the date of its creation.

Upon expiration of that period, such material shall be automatically declassified and released in full, without further action, unless an extension is lawfully granted pursuant to this Section.

(b) Extraordinary Extension Requirements
An extension of secrecy beyond twenty-five (25) years may be granted only where all of the following conditions are satisfied:
	•	Congressional Certification
A select national security committee composed of no fewer than ten (10) members of each chamber of the Legislature shall certify, by recorded supermajority vote, that continued secrecy is strictly necessary to prevent concrete and imminent harm to the Republic.
	•	Judicial Approval
The Constitutional Review Court (CRC) shall approve the extension by written order, supported by specific findings that the constitutional standard for secrecy remains satisfied and that no narrower disclosure is feasible.
	•	Judicial Integrity Review
The Constitutional Judicial Commission (CJC) shall independently review the extension request to assess institutional capture, abuse of classification authority, or conflict of interest, and shall certify that the request is not motivated by embarrassment, reputational protection, political convenience, or concealment of wrongdoing.

Failure to satisfy any of these requirements shall result in immediate declassification.

(c) Limited Duration of Extensions
No extension granted under this Section may exceed five (5) years in duration.

Extensions may not be renewed automatically. Each extension requires a fresh, complete review under subsection (b), supported by updated findings and public notice of continued secrecy.

No record may be withheld beyond a cumulative total of forty (40) years under any circumstances.

(d) Public Override by the People
Notwithstanding any classification, extension, or judicial approval, the People retain ultimate authority over secrecy.

Any classified or withheld material shall be immediately declassified and released upon approval by:
	•	a public referendum achieving a two-thirds (2/3) supermajority of Civic Citizens,
	•	initiated by a public petition signed by no fewer than twenty percent (20%) of Civic Citizens eligible to vote.

No authority may delay, narrow, redact, or condition disclosure once such a vote is certified.

(e) Non-Justiciability of Secrecy Votes
No court may enjoin, stay, delay, or invalidate a declassification effected pursuant to subsection (d).
The judgment of the People in such matters is final and not subject to judicial override.

(f) Prohibited Grounds for Secrecy
Secrecy shall never be justified for the purpose of:
	•	concealing unlawful acts, constitutional violations, or grave offenses;
	•	avoiding embarrassment, political accountability, or reputational harm;
	•	shielding institutions, officials, contractors, or foreign partners from scrutiny;
	•	preserving ideological narratives or historical revisionism.

Any attempt to invoke secrecy for such purposes constitutes a constitutional violation and grave offense.

(g) Burden and Presumption
The burden of justifying secrecy or extension rests entirely upon the government.
All doubts shall be resolved in favor of disclosure.
(g). Criminal Liability for Willful Constitutional Betrayal

(a) Willful Breach of the Constitution Defined
A willful breach of the Constitution occurs where a person, acting under color of law, public authority, delegated power, or institutional control, knowingly and voluntarily violates a clear constitutional prohibition or duty, with intent to evade, undermine, nullify, or defeat the Constitution itself.

Mere error, negligence, reasonable disagreement, or good-faith interpretation shall not constitute a willful breach.

(b) Treason Classification
Any egregious and willful breach of the Constitution shall constitute treason against the Republic and shall be classified as a Tier Three offense under Article VII.

Such treason consists not in disagreement with policy, but in betrayal of sworn constitutional duty.

(c) High Treason
Where a willful constitutional breach:
	•	results in the death of innocent persons;
	•	results in the unlawful confinement, disappearance, or permanent deprivation of liberty of innocent persons; or
	•	enables or conceals mass constitutional violations through secrecy, force, or systemic abuse;

such conduct may be classified as high treason.

High treason is among the few offenses for which the federal government may consider capital punishment, subject to the strict conditions of this Constitution.
The preferred and presumptive punishment shall remain lifetime incapacitating confinement, absent extraordinary findings.

(d) Mandatory Consequences Upon Conviction
Any person convicted of a willful breach of the Constitution shall, at minimum:
	•	permanently forfeit Civic Citizenship;
	•	suffer total confiscation of all property and assets, real and personal, without compensation;
	•	be subject to permanent restriction of travel beyond a narrowly defined geographic area;
	•	be disqualified for life from holding any public office, exercising public authority, or engaging in employment above a menial or supervised level;
	•	be subject to formal public censure, including official records, disclosures, and reminders of the offense in all future dealings with the Republic.

No pardon, commutation, or restoration of status shall be granted except by constitutional supermajority and public notice.

(e) Additional Punishments Permitted
Depending on the nature, scale, and consequences of the betrayal, sentencing may include:
	•	lifetime confinement under Tier Three conditions;
	•	mandatory labor consistent with humane standards;
	•	permanent disbarment from any licensed profession;
	•	symbolic and reputational sanctions designed to ensure the offense is neither forgotten nor repeated.

Punishment shall be harsh, honest, and proportional—but never concealed.

(f) Ridicule as Civic Sanction
Where appropriate and not cruel, the Republic may impose civic ridicule as a formal sanction for constitutional betrayal, including mandated acknowledgment of wrongdoing, public disclosure of offenses, and symbolic reminders designed to deter future violations.

The purpose of such sanction is deterrence, moral clarity, and preservation of constitutional memory, not sadism or spectacle.

(g) Strict Proof of Willfulness Required
No person may be convicted under this Section unless the prosecution proves beyond a reasonable doubt that:
	•	the defendant acted without coercion, duress, or unlawful pressure;
	•	the defendant possessed clear knowledge of the constitutional prohibition or duty violated;
	•	the defendant had meaningful opportunity to refuse or resist the unlawful act;
	•	the defendant nevertheless chose betrayal of the Constitution.

Where credible evidence of coercion, threat, or unlawful command exists, such evidence shall bar conviction under this Section and shall instead be prosecuted against those responsible for the coercion.

(h) No Shield of Office or Emergency
Neither office, rank, national security claim, emergency declaration, secrecy classification, superior orders, nor institutional policy shall excuse or mitigate liability for willful constitutional betrayal.
(i) Protection for Truthful Disclosure

No person shall be criminally, civilly, administratively, or professionally punished for possessing, disclosing, publishing, or transmitting truthful information that evidences:

1. constitutional violations,
2. unlawful acts,
3. corruption,
4. abuse of authority,
5. war crimes,
6. or misuse of secrecy or classification.

This protection applies to whistleblowers, journalists, publishers, researchers, and private citizens.

No secrecy law, classification, contract, or oath may override this protection.
(j) Construction and Lock Status
This Section shall be construed narrowly but firmly, reserved for the gravest acts of betrayal.

Pursuant to Article XV, this Section is lock-protected and may not be repealed, diluted, or reinterpreted except by constitutional amendment meeting the highest procedural threshold.


Section 12. Protection Against Exploitative or Dangerous Acts

Freedom does not extend to acts that degrade human dignity or endanger life, including:

(a) sexual exploitation,
(b) grooming,
(c) coercive rituals,
(d) biological or chemical hazards,
(e) animal cruelty,
(f) dangerous ideological indoctrination.
(g) Requirement of Concrete Harm

No act shall be prohibited under this Section unless it involves:
1. non-consensual exploitation,
2. physical injury,
3. credible threat of injury,
4. unlawful coercion,
5. or demonstrable and substantial risk of biological, chemical, or psychological harm.

Mere expression of belief, ideology, religion, or opinion shall not constitute a violation.
(h) Meaning of Dangerous Ideological Indoctrination

“Dangerous ideological indoctrination” means the intentional conditioning of persons, especially minors or dependents, through coercion, isolation, or psychological manipulation, to compel unlawful violence, self-harm, or surrender of autonomy.

It shall not include peaceful teaching, advocacy, religious instruction, political belief, or dissent.
(i) Meaning of Coercive Rituals

“Coercive rituals” means practices that involve:
1. physical injury,
2. sexual exploitation,
3. confinement,
4. forced ingestion,
5. or credible threats of harm,

and shall not include voluntary cultural, religious, or symbolic practices.

Section 12A. Structural and Indirect Restraints

(a) Functional Test
Any policy, system, or condition that foreseeably results in confinement, forced treatment, loss of movement, or deprivation of liberty shall be treated as detention for constitutional purposes, regardless of formal designation.

(b) Ban on Indirect Compulsion
Liberty shall not be curtailed through denial of housing, employment, travel, benefits, licenses, or civil participation as a means of forcing compliance with treatment, confinement, or behavioral mandates not otherwise authorized by this Constitution.

(c) Judicial Remedy
Structural or indirect restraints found to violate this Section shall be enjoined immediately, and affected persons shall be entitled to damages and restoration of rights.
(d) Substance Over Label

No restraint, penalty, or deprivation shall be exempt from this Section by being labeled as an incentive, eligibility condition, risk mitigation, public health measure, or administrative requirement.

The practical effect on liberty shall govern.
(e) Covered Actors

This Section applies to all actions taken by or through:
1. government agencies,
2. publicly funded entities,
3. regulated monopolies,
4. or private parties acting under color of law.

No delegation shall evade constitutional restraint.

Section 12B. Protection Against Retaliation

(a) Absolute Prohibition
No person shall be retaliated against for asserting, assisting, reporting, or litigating rights under this Article.

(b) Forms of Retaliation Prohibited
Retaliation includes arrest, investigation, audit, surveillance, employment action, license revocation, denial of benefits, intimidation, harassment, or reputational attack.

(c) Presumption of Retaliation
Adverse action taken within one year of protected activity is presumptively retaliatory unless rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.

(d) Enhanced Damages
Retaliatory violations warrant enhanced damages and mandatory removal of responsible officials.
(e) Proxy and Third-Party Retaliation

Retaliation includes any action taken through or by:
1. employers,
2. financial institutions,
3. landlords,
4. insurers,
5. utilities,
6. digital platforms,
7. or other private entities,

where such action is encouraged, requested, coerced, or induced by the state or its agents.
(f) Administrative and Regulatory Harassment

Retaliation includes targeted or disproportionate use of:
• inspections,
• permits,
• zoning,
• taxation,
• licensing,
• code enforcement,
• or regulatory process

for the purpose of punishing or deterring protected activity.

Section 13. Right to Informational Self-Determination and Protection from Surveillance

(a) Inherent Right
The People possess an inherent and inalienable right to privacy, control, and sovereignty over their personal information.

This right includes, but is not limited to, information concerning an individual’s identity, location, communications, associations, health, beliefs, conduct, transactions, preferences, biological data, digital footprint, and inferred characteristics.

(b) Universal Application
This right binds all entities, public and private alike, without exception.

No corporation, organization, platform, intermediary, data broker, employer, insurer, advertiser, or agent may evade this Section by contract, terms of service, consent laundering, proxy collection, or technical indirection.

(c) Consent Standard
No entity may collect, process, infer, profile, store, share, sell, trade, license, or monetize personal data except where:
	•	explicit, informed, granular, and freely given consent has been obtained; and
	•	such consent is revocable at any time without penalty; or
	•	collection is strictly necessary and proportionate to provide a service knowingly and affirmatively requested by the individual.

Silence, continued use, bundled consent, deceptive design, or economic coercion shall not constitute valid consent.

(d) Data Minimization and Purpose Limitation
All data collection shall be limited to what is strictly necessary for a specified, legitimate purpose.

Secondary use, behavioral modeling, predictive profiling, or retention beyond necessity is prohibited.

(e) Prohibition on Mass and Commercial Surveillance
Mass, dragnet, or systemic surveillance of persons for commercial, behavioral, reputational, advertising, or influence purposes is forbidden.

The creation or maintenance of detailed behavioral, psychological, or reputational profiles for purposes unrelated to a directly requested service is prohibited.

(f) Sensitive Inferences
The inference, prediction, or classification of sensitive attributes — including health status, political belief, religious belief, sexual orientation, psychological traits, or moral disposition — is subject to the highest level of protection and shall be presumed unlawful absent explicit, purpose-specific consent.

(g) Right to Access, Correction, and Erasure
Every person has the right to:
	•	know what personal data is held about them;
	•	access such data in intelligible form;
	•	correct inaccuracies;
	•	demand erasure where retention is no longer justified.

(h) Enforcement and Remedies
Violations of this Section constitute infringements of fundamental rights.

Affected persons shall be entitled to injunctive relief, suppression of unlawfully obtained data, compensatory and statutory damages, and all remedies provided elsewhere in this Article.

Systemic or willful violations may trigger liability under Article XI and, where egregious, prosecution under Article VII.

(i) Construction
This Section shall be construed to dismantle systems of exploitation, surveillance, manipulation, and control that reduce persons to data assets, behavioral products, or targets of influence.
(j) Lawful Investigation and Illicit Material Exception
Nothing in this Section shall be construed to prohibit:
	•	Targeted data collection, analysis, or monitoring conducted by law enforcement pursuant to a lawful warrant, court order, or constitutionally authorized investigative power;
	•	The detection, reporting, or preservation of evidence of illicit material, including material involving violence, sexual exploitation of minors, trafficking, terrorism, or other grave offenses, where such activity is:
	•	narrowly tailored,
	•	directly related to the identification or prevention of crime, and
	•	not repurposed for commercial, reputational, or behavioral profiling;
	•	Mandatory reporting duties imposed by law for known or reasonably suspected criminal material, provided such duties do not authorize generalized surveillance of lawful persons.
(k) Invalidity of Coerced or Essential-Service Consent

Consent shall be void where access to employment, housing, healthcare, education, banking, communications, transportation, or participation in modern society is conditioned upon surrender of informational rights.

No person shall be forced to trade privacy for survival, livelihood, or civic participation.

(l) Public–Private Surveillance Prohibition

No government entity may request, purchase, receive, or induce the collection of personal data by private parties in a manner that would be unlawful if performed directly by the state.

Data obtained in violation of this principle shall be inadmissible and must be destroyed.

Section 14. Lock Designation

Pursuant to Article XV (Amendments, Lock Clauses, and Anti-Emergency Drift), Article II — Rights, Liberties, and Personal Sovereignty is hereby designated as LOCK-PROTECTED.
This lock extends to all interpretive rules, timelines, remedies, and cross-references to Article 0 definitions incorporated herein.
 A. Scope of Lock

This lock applies to the entirety of Article II, including but not limited to:
	•	all enumerated rights, liberties, and protections;
	•	all interpretive rules, enforcement mechanisms, timelines, remedies, and liabilities;
	•	all provisions governing privacy, bodily autonomy, due process, informational self-determination, transparency, and protection against coercive or exploitative acts.

No portion of Article II shall be repealed, suspended, weakened, narrowed, reinterpreted, or rendered ineffectual except in strict conformity with this Lock Declaration.

 B. Prohibited Forms of Alteration

The following are expressly forbidden with respect to Article II:
	•	dilution of rights through balancing tests, proportionality frameworks, or interest-weighing doctrines not expressly authorized by the Constitution;
	•	reclassification of rights restrictions as civil, administrative, medical, regulatory, emergency, or non-punitive to evade constitutional safeguards;
	•	suspension or circumvention of rights by declaration of emergency, crisis, necessity, national security, or asserted expertise;
	•	indirect erosion through delegation, privatization, proxy enforcement, or consent laundering;
	•	judicial reinterpretation that narrows scope, standing, remedies, timelines, or enforceability;
	•	creation of parallel legal regimes, emergency courts, special jurisdictions, or extraordinary procedures to avoid or bypass Article II protections.

Any attempt to accomplish such alteration by statute, regulation, executive action, judicial doctrine, or international agreement is void ab initio.

 C. Permitted Amendments (Narrow Exception)

Amendment to Article II may occur only for the purpose of:
	•	clarifying internal consistency or cross-article coordination without reducing substantive protection;
	•	expanding rights, remedies, or enforcement protections;
	•	incorporating newly recognized forms of coercion, surveillance, exploitation, or domination not previously contemplated, provided such amendments strengthen liberty rather than restrict it.

No amendment may reduce, condition, delay, or subordinate any right secured by Article II.

 D. Amendment Threshold

Any amendment to Article II shall require all of the following:
	•	approval by a supermajority of both chambers of the Legislature, as defined in Article XV;
	•	certification by the Supreme Court of the Republic that the amendment does not diminish substantive rights or enforcement;
	•	independent review by the Constitutional Judicial Commission (CJC) affirming absence of institutional capture or coercion;
	•	ratification by the People, under procedures no less rigorous than those required for original constitutional adoption.

Failure to satisfy any requirement shall invalidate the amendment in its entirety.

 E. Anti-Backsliding Rule

No amendment, statute, regulation, or judicial interpretation adopted after the ratification of this Lock shall be construed to reduce the level of protection afforded by Article II.

Where conflict exists between newer provisions and Article II, Article II shall control.

 F. Judicial Duty

All courts of the Republic are bound to:
	•	enforce Article II as written;
	•	resolve ambiguities in favor of liberty, dignity, and personal sovereignty;
	•	reject doctrines that would transform rights into privileges or permissions.

Failure by a court or judge to honor this Lock constitutes constitutional misconduct.

 G. Declaration of Intent

This Lock reflects the deliberate judgment of the People that liberty is not provisional, that dignity is not negotiable, and that rights once secured shall not be surrendered to fear, convenience, fashion, or power.

Article II stands as the irreducible moral and legal boundary of the Republic.
