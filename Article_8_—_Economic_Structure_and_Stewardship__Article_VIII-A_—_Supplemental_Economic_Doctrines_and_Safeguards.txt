Offshoring of labor, production, or capital undertaken for the primary purpose of evading constitutional labor standards, environmental protections, safety requirements, or ethical obligations is prohibited.

Re-importation of goods or services produced through such bad-faith offshoring shall not receive legal protection, subsidy, or preferential treatment.

Corporate form, jurisdictional layering, or contractual indirection shall not shield such conduct from accountability.

Section 8. Transparency of Economic Instruments

All public economic instruments, including debt instruments, guarantees, subsidies, and monetary mechanisms, shall be documented and preserved as public records.

Secrecy, complexity, or technical opacity shall not be used to conceal economic transfer, risk, or obligation from the People.
