ARTICLE XXII — BODILY AUTONOMY, FAMILY, AND CHILD REARING

Charge

This Article establishes constitutional protections governing bodily autonomy, family formation, fertility, and the upbringing of children within the Republic. All public authority exercised in these domains shall be construed narrowly and solely to protect individual rights, parental authority, and family integrity against coercion, undue interference, or compelled conformity.

Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to authorize governmental control, direction, or substitution of judgment over personal bodily decisions, lawful family life, or the upbringing of children, except as expressly permitted by law, supported by clear and convincing evidence, and consistent with constitutional limits.

Section 1. Bodily Autonomy

Every person possesses an inherent right to bodily autonomy.

No person shall be compelled by the State to undergo medical treatment, bodily alteration, sterilization, experimentation, or biological intervention without free and informed consent, except where narrowly necessary to prevent imminent and grave harm to others and subject to due process and judicial review.

Bodily autonomy shall not be abridged through direct or indirect coercion, including denial of employment, travel, education, benefits, legal status, or civil participation, except where expressly authorized by this Constitution and supported by clear and convincing evidence of necessity.

Section 2. Pregnancy, Reproductive Decisions, and Non-Coercion

Decisions concerning pregnancy, reproduction, contraception, sterilization, and related medical care implicate profound interests of bodily autonomy, moral conscience, family integrity, and personal responsibility.

The Republic shall neither compel nor prohibit reproductive outcomes through coercion, penalty, threat, or inducement, nor condition civil rights or legal status upon reproductive choices, fertility status, or pregnancy outcomes.

No public authority shall treat pregnancy or pregnancy termination as presumptive criminal conduct. Any regulation of pregnancy or abortion shall be civil in character unless individualized proof establishes criminal intent independent of the pregnancy itself.

Voluntary sterilization by competent adults shall be a protected personal choice. The State shall not prohibit, compel, or penalize such decisions. Public funding for elective sterilization or elective pregnancy termination shall not occur except where expressly authorized by law.

Section 3. Family Formation and Fertility

The right to form a family, to marry or not marry, and to decide whether and when to bear children belongs to the People and shall not be dictated by the State.

The Republic shall neither compel nor prohibit reproduction, sterilization, contraception, or fertility decisions, nor condition civil rights, benefits, or legal standing upon such choices.

Public funding, subsidy, or sponsorship of fertility, reproduction, or family formation shall not occur except where expressly authorized by law to address demonstrable crisis conditions threatening the survival or basic functioning of the Republic, and only for the duration and scope strictly necessary to address such conditions.

Section 4. Parental Authority and Child Rearing

Parents or lawful guardians possess the primary right and duty to direct the upbringing, education, moral formation, medical care, and lawful discipline of their children.

The State shall not supplant, override, or interfere with parental authority absent clear and convincing evidence, after due process and judicial determination, of abuse, neglect, or imminent and specific danger to the child.

Child rearing shall not be used as a vehicle for ideological enforcement, demographic engineering, social experimentation, or substitution of state judgment for parental conscience.

Section 5. Limits on State Intervention

The Republic may act to protect children or other vulnerable persons only where necessary to prevent serious and specific harm. Any such intervention shall be:

a. narrowly tailored to the individualized risk;
b. proportionate to the harm sought to be prevented;
c. subject to prompt judicial oversight and periodic review;
d. terminated immediately upon resolution of the risk.

No general presumption of parental unfitness shall exist, and no class-based, belief-based, or status-based standard shall substitute for individualized proof.

Section 6. Non-Discrimination and Equal Protection

No person or family shall be discriminated against, penalized, or deprived of rights or opportunities on the basis of lawful family structure, fertility status, pregnancy outcome, number of children, sterilization status, or parental choices, except where necessary to protect the rights and safety of others and supported by clear and convincing evidence.

Section 7. Construction

This Article shall be interpreted to:

a. favor personal responsibility over state control;
b. preserve the primacy of family, conscience, and informed consent in human formation;
c. forbid direct or indirect coercion of bodily, reproductive, or parental decisions in any direction;
d. require individualized proof and strict scrutiny for any state intrusion into pregnancy, child rearing, or bodily autonomy;
e. harmonize with Article XXVI (Charter of Inviolable Rights) and Article XXXVIII (Disaster Response), without permitting emergency, crisis, or public-health claims to dissolve these protections.

Section 8. Status

This Article is unlocked and subject to amendment pursuant to Article XV.
