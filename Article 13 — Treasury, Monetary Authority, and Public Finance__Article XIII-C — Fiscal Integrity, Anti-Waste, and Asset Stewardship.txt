Article XIII-C — Fiscal Integrity, Anti-Waste, and Asset Stewardship

Section 1. Prohibition of Baseline Budgeting

No budgetary authority, appropriation, or funding level shall be determined by reference to prior-year expenditure alone.

The use of “baseline budgeting,” “use-it-or-lose-it” allocation models, or any doctrine that incentivizes unnecessary expenditure to preserve future funding is hereby prohibited.

New or increased funding shall require affirmative justification independent of prior-year expenditure, demonstrating value added, necessity, and efficiency.

All appropriations shall be justified on demonstrated necessity, efficiency, and public benefit, independent of prior consumption.

⸻

Section 2. Carryover, Return, and Credit of Unused Funds

Unexpended public funds shall not be forfeited or penalized solely due to non-use.

Agencies shall be permitted, and encouraged, to:
	•	return unused funds to the Treasury;
	•	carry forward justified balances, subject to audit and reasonable limits defined by law.;
	•	receive credit for efficiency, conservation, and cost reduction.
Savings achieved through efficiency or conservation shall not trigger automatic future reductions or adverse personnel action.
No agency shall suffer reduction, retaliation, or loss of mission authority solely for spending less than appropriated.

⸻

Section 3. Prohibition on Destruction of Usable Public Assets

The intentional destruction, disposal, or disabling of functional public property, equipment, or supplies for the purpose of preserving budget authority, justifying procurement, or avoiding accounting adjustment is prohibited.

Usable assets shall be:
	•	redeployed,
	•	transferred,
	•	stored,
	•	sold,
	•	or returned to public inventory,

unless destruction is required for safety, security, or lawful demilitarization under strict oversight.
Mandatory redeployment or transfer screening shall precede any disposal or destruction of usable public assets.

⸻

Section 4. Procurement Integrity and Anti-Gaming Rule

No officer, agency, or contractor may procure goods or services without demonstrable necessity for current or reasonably anticipated public use.

Procurement undertaken primarily to:
	•	exhaust budgets,
	•	preserve funding levels,
	•	prevent future reductions,
	•	or manufacture apparent demand

shall constitute fiscal misconduct and breach of public trust..

⸻

Section 5. Audit, Enforcement, and Standing

Independent auditors shall review compliance with this Article.

Knowingly engaging in prohibited practices under this Article constitutes:
	•	breach of public trust,
	•	fiscal misconduct,
	•	and grounds for removal, sanction, and restitution.

Taxpayers, oversight bodies, and designated inspectors shall have standing to challenge violations.

Audits shall be conducted regularly and made publicly available, subject only to narrow security redactions.

⸻

Section 6. Prohibition on Monopoly Pricing and Certification Rent-Seeking

No public procurement shall be awarded on the basis of domestic origin, certification, or political designation where such designation is used to justify prices grossly exceeding fair market value for equivalent quality and performance.

The use of patriotic labeling, domestic-content rules, or regulatory exclusivity to extract monopoly rents from the public treasury is prohibited.

Goods priced substantially above market norms without demonstrable superiority in performance, security, or lifecycle cost shall be presumed noncompliant.

Such presumption may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence of superior performance, security, or lifecycle value.

⸻

Section 7. Conditional Domestic Preference (Good-Faith Rule)

Preference for goods manufactured within the Republic may be afforded only where domestic suppliers:

(a) offer goods of comparable quality and performance;
(b) price such goods within a reasonable margin of prevailing global market rates;
(c) do not rely on exclusive certification, political influence, or procurement lock-in to suppress competition.

Domestic preference shall not operate as an entitlement to supra-market pricing.

Failure to meet these conditions constitutes breach of patriotic duty and forfeiture of preferential treatment.

⸻

Section 8. Authorization of Foreign Procurement Upon Domestic Failure

Where domestic suppliers fail to provide goods of adequate quality at reasonable market-aligned prices, the Republic shall not be compelled to procure inferior or exorbitantly priced domestic alternatives.

In such cases, procurement of foreign-manufactured goods is authorized and shall not be deemed disloyal, unpatriotic, or contrary to national interest.

National interest is served by stewardship of public funds, readiness, quality, and resilience—not by enrichment of protected monopolies.

Overreliance on protected domestic monopolies that undermines readiness or supply resilience shall constitute domestic failure under this Section.

⸻

Section 9. Defense and Critical Systems Safeguard

For defense, public safety, and critical infrastructure procurement, comparative evaluation shall include:

(a) unit cost;
(b) performance under realistic conditions;
(c) durability and lifecycle cost;
(d) interoperability and logistics;
(e) security and supply resilience.

No vendor may rely solely on domestic origin to avoid comparative evaluation.

⸻

Section 10. Anti-Capture Enforcement

Knowingly approving or maintaining procurement arrangements that:

(a) impose extreme price disparities;
(b) suppress competitive sourcing without necessity;
(c) enrich vendors through political connection rather than value;
(d) shield suppliers from review under patriotic pretext;

constitutes fiscal misconduct and breach of public trust and may result in personal liability.

Standing to challenge such practices shall extend to auditors, inspectors, legislators, and taxpayers as provided by law.

⸻

Section 11. Construction

This Article shall be construed to:
	•	reward efficiency rather than consumption,
	•	preserve public assets,
	•	eliminate perverse incentives,
	•	and restore stewardship as the governing principle of public finance.
	•	support domestic industry in good faith;
	•	prohibit procurement parasitism disguised as patriotism;
	•	reward quality, efficiency, and resilience;
	•	preserve national capability without tolerating extortion.

No slogan, certification, or political designation shall override fiduciary duty to the People.
No emergency, national security claim, or administrative doctrine shall be used to revive baseline budgeting or justify waste.
Domestic origin shall be treated as a preference of good faith, not a license for extortion.
