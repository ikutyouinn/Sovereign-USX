Section 4. Popular Override of Law and Judicial Doctrine
4.1 Ultimate Popular Authority
Civic Citizens retain the ultimate authority to approve, nullify, override, or restore governmental action taken under this Constitution, including statutes, regulations, and binding judicial holdings or doctrines, subject to the procedural safeguards herein and the lock protections of Article XV.

No court or agency is required to submit any matter to referendum. Referenda occur only upon citizen initiation as provided herein.

4.1A Constitutional Boundary (No Amendment by Override)

No citizen-initiated override under this Section may amend, suspend, repeal, unlock, lock, reinterpret, or otherwise alter the text, structure, or legal effect of this Constitution.

Any petition whose legal effect would directly alter constitutional text, constitutional structure, or lock-protected operation shall be treated as a proposed constitutional amendment or unlocking measure and must proceed exclusively under Article XV, including any heightened thresholds required for unlocking.

4.2 Single-Issue Requirement

Any citizen-initiated override petition shall address one discrete governmental action or legal question only, stated plainly and without aggregation, conditional language, or bundled demands.

A petition that combines multiple actions, policies, or grievances shall be invalid.4.3 Threshold for InitiationA binding popular review may be triggered only upon petition by not less than twenty percent (20%) of Civic Citizens, verified within a fixed statutory period.

4.4 Cooling-Off and Anti-Spam Limitation
No substantially identical petition concerning the same governmental action may be initiated more than once within a defined cooling-off period following a failed referendum or judicial resolution.

The cooling-off period shall be one hundred eighty (180) days, unless the petitioners demonstrate a material change in facts or circumstances occurring after the prior vote or resolution.

A material change includes, but is not limited to:

a. disclosure of previously classified or concealed information;

b. evidence of fraud, misrepresentation, or bad-faith justification by public officials;

c. expansion, prolongation, or material escalation of the challenged action;

d. substantial deviation between stated objectives and actual conduct or outcomes;

e. significant new harm to life, liberty, or national interest not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the prior vote.

The certification authority shall make a threshold determination of material change solely as to form and sufficiency, not political merit.
Mere changes in public opinion, absent new facts or circumstances, shall not constitute material change.

4.5 Amendment-Grade Procedural Safeguards (Form and Disclosure)

All override petitions and referenda under this Section shall satisfy the amendment-grade safeguards of Article XV concerning:
(1) single-subject form;
(2) a plain-language explanation of purpose and effect;
(3) disclosure of all affected provisions, rules, tests, or doctrines; and
(4) public deliberation safeguards.

These safeguards apply regardless of whether the override affects statutory law, regulation, or judicial doctrine, but shall not be construed to impose constitutional amendment thresholds, state-ratification requirements, or unlocking procedures unless the petition triggers the Constitutional Boundary in Section 4.1A.
4.6 Expedited Review Window; Interim Rule
Upon certification of a valid petition, the matter shall proceed to an expedited, binding referendum within a constitutionally prescribed timeframe.

Pending such referendum, the default-to-liberty provisions of this Article shall govern only as to prospective enforcement or expansion of the challenged action, unless a court finds by clear and convincing evidence that continued enforcement is strictly necessary to prevent imminent and specific harm.

4.7 Outcome and Effect
(a) Ordinary Override Threshold

A referendum under this Section shall be required to meet the Supermajority Rule as defined in Article 0.

No higher threshold applies under this Section unless the petition triggers the Constitutional Boundary in Section 4.1A, in which case the matter proceeds under Article XV (including the unlocking threshold where applicable).
(b) Statutory Override Effect
Upon adoption, the challenged statute or regulation is void and unenforceable to the extent overridden.

(c) Judicial Override Effect
Upon adoption, the challenged judicial holding, doctrine, test, standard of review, or precedent shall have no binding or precedential effect and shall not be relied upon by any court or agency.
Affected cases shall be remanded or re-adjudicated under the remaining law and this Constitution, as applicable.

(d) Lock-Protected Limitation
No override may amend, suspend, repeal, weaken, narrow, reinterpret, or render ineffectual any lock-protected provision except by compliance with Article XV, including any heightened approval thresholds required by Article XV for lock-protected change.

4.8 Protection Against Harassment of Review Bodies
No court, commission, or review body shall be required to entertain repetitive, bad-faith, or procedurally defective citizen petitions designed primarily to obstruct governance or exhaust institutional capacity.
Certification authorities may summarily reject petitions that fail to meet the requirements of this Section.
Section 5. Conditional Provisions, Definitions, and Global Interpretive Safeguards

5.1 Conditional and Transitional Clauses

Where this Constitution uses terms such as “during transition,” “phase-in,” “temporary,” “sunset,” “until,” “unless,” or otherwise identifies a provision as time-limited or contingent on a defined condition, such language shall be construed as operative only within the stated scope and duration.

No conditional or transitional clause may be construed to authorize indefinite delay, perpetual “temporary” government, or administrative suspension of constitutional rights.

5.2 Global Principles of Interpretation

Principles of interpretation expressly incorporated by reference from any Article shall apply globally unless expressly overridden.

In cases of genuine ambiguity, delay, deadlock, procedural hold, inaction, or interpretive doubt regarding any provision, power, right, or obligation under this Constitution, interpretation shall favor:
liberty over restraint,
individual rights over administrative convenience,
accountability and transparency over secrecy, and
the sovereignty of the People over the expansion or preservation of governmental authority.

Delay shall not be construed as denial of liberty. No governmental body, officer, or procedure may use inaction, procedural obstruction, or indefinite hold to impair, suspend, or defeat a constitutional right, safeguard, or duly authorized exercise of lawful power.

In cases involving alleged violations of plain-language requirements, ambiguity or complexity shall be construed against the Republic and in favor of liberty and public comprehension, consistent with the In Dubio Pro Libertate principle.

5.3 Definitions, Glossaries, and Supplementation

The Consolidated Defined Terms list in this Article shall be deemed automatically supplemented by any new definitions expressly added to this Article by constitutional amendment.

Statutes may define technical, administrative, or implementing terms for purposes of execution, provided that:
(1) no statutory definition may conflict with this Constitution;
(2) no statutory definition may narrow, expand, manipulate, or redefine any constitutional term in a manner that changes substantive rights, prohibitions, thresholds, caps, floors, or jurisdictional limits;
(3) no statutory definition may introduce “newspeak,” euphemism, or ideological relabeling intended to evade accountability or alter public meaning; and
(4) any statutory definition adopted for general public governance must be written in plain language and recorded by the Public Ministry of Records in a public glossary.

Definitions adopted by statute shall be strictly construed and shall not expand substantive powers, authorities, or limitations beyond those expressly authorized by this Constitution.

5.4 Anti-Paralysis and Anti-Capture Safeguard

No emergency, continuity, necessity, deadlock, or procedural doctrine may suspend, restrict, delay, obstruct, or interfere with the operation of the Constitutional Judicial Commission, or with any constitutional integrity, oversight, anti-capture, or anti-collusion body established by this Constitution.

Any attempt to do so—whether by inaction, pretextual procedural hold, evasion, or indefinite delay—is void ab initio and constitutes grave constitutional malfeasance.

5.5 Duplicate Definitions

Where a definition from this Article is reproduced elsewhere for readability, the reproduced text shall be identical; any conflict is resolved in favor of this Article.

No private entity may solicit, induce, or participate in collusive arrangements prohibited by this Article.

Private compliance with unconstitutional coordination shall not confer immunity.

⸻

Section 3. Presumptions and Burden of Proof

Collusion shall be presumed where:

Section 4. Anti-Laundering Rule
No statutory court, tribunal, board, agency, or executive process may be used to:  - evade Constitutional Review Court constitutional review; - shield institutional misconduct from Constitutional Judicial Commission investigation; or - substitute administrative process for constitutional adjudication.  Any attempt to do so is void.
Section 5. Construction and Anti-Dilution Rule
This Article shall be construed to preserve:  - rapid constitutional enforcement; - slow and deliberative final review; and - constant protection against institutional capture.  No later Article may impliedly repeal, dilute, or reassign the routing established herein.

Article I — Principles and Nature of the Republic

Charge

The Republic is founded upon the inherent dignity, equal worth, and natural rights of all persons, which exist prior to and above government.

Government is created not to grant rights, but to recognize, protect, and secure them through law, restraint, and accountable power.

This Constitution establishes a Republic of ordered liberty, in which freedom is preserved by law, power is bounded by duty, and public authority exists solely to serve the People.

Civic authority is not inherited, purchased, or seized, but earned through lawful participation, service, and allegiance to constitutional order.

No office, institution, or majority may lawfully override the supremacy of this Constitution, the sovereignty of the People, or the inviolable rights it protects.

This Article sets forth the foundational structure of the Republic: the nature of sovereignty, the limits of power, the distinction between civil and political status, and the duties of stewardship and vigilance that bind all who govern.
Legal Text

Section 1. Nature of the Republic

The Republic is a constitutional, rights-bounded system of ordered liberty grounded in justice, responsibility, and stewardship.

Government exists solely to:
(a) recognize, protect, and secure the natural and civil rights of the People;
(b) uphold equal justice under law;
(c) provide public goods that cannot be effectively supplied by individuals or markets; and
(d) preserve the constitutional order.

Ordered liberty means liberty exercised under law, bounded by the equal rights of others, and constrained by duties of citizenship and public trust — not license, coercion, or arbitrary power.

No authority may redefine “justice,” “evidence,” “morality,” or “public good” to negate, diminish, or subordinate the rights secured by this Constitution.
(cross-reference Article 0; Article II; Article XXVI)

Section 2. Supremacy of the Constitution

This Constitution is the supreme law of the Republic and binds all branches, officers, agencies, courts, subdivisions, and instrumentalities of government.

Any statute, treaty, decree, regulation, ordinance, executive action, judicial doctrine, or administrative practice inconsistent with this Constitution is void and without legal force.

No emergency, necessity, international obligation, or claimed sovereign immunity shall excuse noncompliance.

All public officials owe primary allegiance to this Constitution and are personally accountable for acts taken in violation of it.

Section 3. Separation of Powers

The Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches are separate, coequal, and bound by this Constitution.

Each branch shall exercise only the powers expressly granted to it, and no branch may exercise, delegate, assume, or conceal the powers of another.

Coequality means no branch is subordinate to another in constitutional authority, but all are subordinate to the Constitution and the People.

No branch may evade accountability through:
• delegation to unaccountable bodies,
• reclassification of powers,
• emergency doctrine,
• judicial or administrative invention, or
• procedural obstruction.

All branches remain continuously accountable to the People and to constitutional review.

Section 4. Moral and Civilizational Foundation

The Republic affirms that liberty cannot be sustained without respect for human dignity, historical continuity, and ethical restraint.

This Constitution is informed by the accumulated moral, legal, and philosophical traditions of human civilization, including principles of justice, mercy, truth, accountability, and stewardship.

Moral principles may guide law, but no moral, religious, cultural, or ideological doctrine shall be imposed by the state as a condition of legal status, civil rights, or political participation.

No religion, creed, philosophy, or belief system shall be established, endorsed, or enforced by government, nor shall belief or conscience be coerced.

No provision of this Section shall be construed to authorize:
(a) establishment of religion;
(b) preference for one faith, culture, or worldview over another;
(c) civil hierarchy based on belief; or
(d) coercion of conscience or identity.

Courts shall construe this Section to preserve moral grounding without permitting theocracy, ideological enforcement, or cultural supremacy.

(cross-reference Article XXXII; Article II §1(a))

Section 5. Civic Status and Non-Civic Citizens

Non-civic citizens include:
(a) persons born within the territory of the Republic;
(b) persons born abroad to citizens of the Republic; and
(c) all persons lawfully admitted for permanent residence.

All non-civic citizens retain the full and equal protection of the Constitution, including all rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights, such as freedom of speech, religion, conscience, movement, enterprise, property, due process, and access to the courts.
(cross-reference Article II; Article 0)

Non-civic citizens may participate fully in civil society, culture, education, labor, association, and public discourse.

Political authority — including the right to vote, hold public office, or exercise control over government institutions — shall be exercised only by Civic Citizens who have satisfied the service, qualification, and loyalty requirements of Article III.

Civic status is a qualification for governance, not a classification of human worth. No civil right, legal protection, or human dignity shall depend upon civic status.

No person shall be deprived of civil rights, property, liberty, or legal standing on the basis of non-civic status, nor may any authority redefine or manipulate civic classifications to evade constitutional protections.

Section 6. Rights of Unlawful Entrants

Persons who enter or reside unlawfully retain the right to:
(a) due process of law;
(b) freedom from violence, coercion, and abuse;
(c) humane treatment; and
(d) Good Samaritan aid necessary to preserve life and dignity.

Unlawful entrants shall not possess political rights, shall not be counted for purposes of representation or apportionment, and shall not acquire lawful status or civic standing through executive, administrative, or political discretion alone.

Any grant, denial, or regularization of status shall occur only through procedures established by law, subject to judicial review and consistent with this Constitution.

Section 7. Mechanisms of Rectification

A lawful and limited pathway of rectification may exist for:
(a) persons brought into the Republic as minors through no fault of their own; or
(b) persons who demonstrate exceptional, verifiable contributions to the public welfare, national security, or civic life of the Republic.

Rectification shall be:
(a) administered by independent, non-partisan bodies;
(b) governed by objective, transparent, and measurable criteria;
(c) subject to judicial review; and
(d) limited in scale so as not to permit demographic engineering, political manipulation, or mass regularization.

No individual, class, or group shall obtain lawful status, residency, or civic standing through discretionary amnesty, executive action, or political bargaining.

Section 8. Condemnation of Corruption and Oathbreaking

Oathbreaking, corruption, fraud, and abuse of public office constitute grave offenses against the Republic and the People.

Public office is a fiduciary trust. Every officer owes a duty of loyalty, honesty, and lawful service to the Constitution and to the People.

Any official who:
(a) knowingly violates the Constitution;
(b) uses office for private gain;
(c) abuses authority;
(d) betrays public trust; or
(e) participates in institutional capture
shall be subject to removal, disqualification, civil liability, and criminal prosecution as provided by law.

No oath, immunity, rank, or position shall shield any person from accountability for betrayal of public trust.

Section 9. Duty of Stewardship

All citizens and all holders of public office owe a constitutional duty of stewardship over land, resources, institutions, and the public trust.

Stewardship means the fiduciary obligation to preserve, maintain, and improve the long-term welfare, resilience, and continuity of the Republic for present and future generations.
(as defined in Article 0)

Neglect, waste, looting, short-term exploitation, or predatory conduct that materially weakens the Republic, degrades its resources, or undermines its institutions constitutes a breach of constitutional duty.

Breach of stewardship is enforceable through civil liability, forfeiture, disqualification from office, and criminal sanction as provided by law.

(cross-reference Articles IX; XXXVII)

Section 10. Eternal Vigilance

(a) Principle

Liberty and constitutional integrity require continuous vigilance. Tyranny, corruption, and decay must be actively opposed and shall not be permitted to arise through silence, fear, or institutional drift.

(b) Right

The People retain the right to peaceably oppose, expose, criticize, investigate, and lawfully resist:
• constitutional violations;
• corruption;
• unlawful authority; and
• abuse of public power.

(c) Protection

No person shall be punished, harassed, censored, surveilled, deprived of rights, or subjected to retaliation for lawful civic protest, whistleblowing, journalism, oversight, or public criticism undertaken in defense of constitutional order.

(d) Civic Duty

All citizens, and especially all holders of public office, have a duty to defend this Constitution, report violations, refuse unlawful orders, and oppose institutional capture, even when such defense is unpopular or dangerous.

Section 11. Lock Designation

Civic vigilance, lawful oversight, and informed engagement by the People are essential to the health and survival of the Republic.

The core principles of this Article — including:
• ordered liberty;
• moral and civilizational grounding;
• the supremacy of the Constitution;
• separation of powers;
• the duty of stewardship; and
• the distinction between Civic and non-civic citizens —
are structural to this Constitution and shall not be repealed, suspended, diluted, or reinterpreted to undermine liberty, accountability, or popular sovereignty.

These principles may be amended only through the lock-protected procedures of Article XV and only in a manner that preserves, and does not diminish, their substantive force.

No statute, regulation, executive action, treaty, or judicial doctrine may evade or weaken this Lock.

Article X — Knowledge, Technology, and the Digital Commons
Charge 

This Article establishes constitutional principles governing knowledge, science, technology, and the digital commons of the Republic. All provisions of this Article shall be construed to promote public access, lawful innovation, transparency, interoperability, and the use of technology in service of individual liberty and democratic self-government. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to authorize technological control, surveillance, restriction of knowledge, or compulsory dependency except as expressly provided by this Constitution and subject to judicial review.

Legal Text
Section 1. Knowledge as a Public Trust (a) Principle of Stewardship Knowledge produced within the Republic, especially through public funding, public labor, or public mandate, is held in trust for the People. No government, corporation, or individual may monopolize, conceal, or weaponize essential knowledge to undermine liberty, public safety, or democratic self-government.
(b) Public Access Scientific research, policy data, regulatory evidence, and technical standards funded by public means shall be publicly accessible, auditable, reproducible where practicable, and archived for posterity. Exceptions may exist only for narrowly defined national security concerns, subject to judicial review and sunset requirements.
(c) Prohibition on Knowledge Suppression It is unlawful for any authority to suppress, distort, or falsify knowledge for political, ideological, or financial advantage. Deliberate suppression of material scientific, medical, economic, or technological facts that causes public harm constitutes a grave offense.

Section 2. The Digital Commons (a) Definition and Scope The Digital Commons consists of public digital infrastructure, publicly accessible networks, government-operated platforms, essential digital utilities, and public data repositories. These systems shall operate for the benefit of the People and may not be privatized in a manner that compromises public access, fairness, or sovereignty.
(b) Neutrality and Access Digital infrastructure operated or regulated by the Republic shall provide equal access without viewpoint discrimination, operate transparently, publish moderation, ranking, and access rules, and prohibit covert manipulation of visibility or reach.
(c) Prohibition on Digital Exclusion No lawful resident may be excluded from essential digital services required for civic participation, education, commerce, or public information, except by due process of law.
(d) For purposes of this Article, “technology” includes autonomous, semi-autonomous, robotic, cyber-physical, and embedded systems, whether stationary or mobile, consumer or industrial.
(e) Safety, liability, or regulatory classification shall not be used to perpetuate vendor control, remote disablement, or restriction of lawful modification after meaningful commercial use has expired.

Section 3. Artificial Intelligence and Automated Systems (a) Permitted Use Artificial intelligence may assist human judgment in data analysis, logistics, research, and administration. AI shall not replace human judgment in matters of rights, liberty, justice, or political power.
(b) Prohibited Uses No AI system may determine guilt or innocence, impose criminal penalties, decide eligibility for rights, manipulate political behavior, conduct psychological operations on the People, engage in deceptive impersonation of humans, or operate without traceability or auditability.
(c) Transparency and Audit All AI systems used by government or critical infrastructure must be documented, auditable, disclose decision logic to authorized oversight bodies, and permit challenge and appeal.
(d) Human Accountability Responsibility for AI-assisted decisions rests with identifiable human officials. All systems shall include a documented mechanism for human override.

Section 4. Information Integrity and Manipulation (a) Prohibition on Information Warfare Against the People It is forbidden for any government agency, intelligence service, corporation, or proxy actor to manipulate search results, algorithmically distort political information, fabricate consensus, or deploy covert influence campaigns against the People.
(b) Separation of Intelligence and Media No intelligence agency, contractor, or former officer within a cooling-off period of not less than five (5) years may own, direct, or covertly influence major media or information platforms.
(c) Platform Accountability Large information platforms shall disclose ownership, funding sources, algorithmic ranking principles, permit independent audits, and refrain from covert manipulation.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall audit platform disclosures and algorithmic behavior for manipulation, political interference, or information warfare and may petition the Constitutional Review Court for corrective orders, sanctions, or platform breakup.

Section 5. Digital Property and Personal Sovereignty (a) Personal Data Ownership Individuals retain ownership of their personal data. Collection or use requires informed, revocable consent.
(b) Limits on Surveillance Mass surveillance without individualized suspicion and judicial warrant is prohibited.
(c) Digital Due Process No person may be digitally deplatformed or denied essential services without notice, explanation, opportunity to respond, and judicial review, except where immediate and demonstrable danger exists.

Section 6. Open Innovation and the Commons of Knowledge
(a) Open Standards The Republic favors open technical standards, interoperability, and transparency over proprietary lock-in.
(b) Intellectual Property Balance Intellectual property exists to encourage creation, not perpetual rent-seeking. IP protections shall be time-limited, proportional, non-predatory, and incapable of extinguishing the commons.
(c) Prohibition on Technological Serfdom No technology may be designed, licensed, or enforced in a manner that creates dependency without exit, disables repair or modification, coerces perpetual payment for basic function, or strips ownership from lawful purchasers.
(d) Right to Repair All citizens and lawful residents possess the unqualified right to repair, modify, or maintain any lawfully acquired device, vehicle, machinery, or equipment. No manufacturer, vendor, or service provider may:
	•	withhold parts, tools, diagnostics, or documentation necessary for repair;
	•	impose contractual restrictions on third-party or self-repair;
	•	use software locks, authentication systems, or firmware restrictions to prevent repair or modification;
	•	void warranties solely due to independent or third-party repair.
This right extends to agricultural, industrial, consumer, and medical equipment. Safety-critical components may be regulated, but such regulation shall not function as a barrier to lawful repair.
(e) Open APIs for Essential Services Essential digital services, including payment systems, messaging platforms, identity verification services, and cloud storage, shall provide open, documented application programming interfaces after maturity as defined by law, to ensure interoperability and prevent technological lock-in.
(f) Platform Neutrality and Open Distribution
No operating system, device manufacturer, or platform may require a single controlled marketplace as the sole means of software distribution.
Alternative stores, sideloading, and third-party distribution shall be permitted without penalty or degradation.

Section 7. Software, Hardware, and Digital Heritage Preservation

(a) Principle of Digital Continuity
Software, hardware designs, artificial intelligence systems, and digital platforms constitute civilizational knowledge. When such systems no longer serve a serious commercial purpose, they shall not be permitted to vanish, decay, or remain locked behind obsolete legal barriers. The Republic affirms a duty to preserve, study, restore, and evolve the technological inheritance of the People.

(b) Abandonment and Sunset Rule
Any proprietary software, hardware platform, artificial intelligence model, or technical system shall be transferred to the Digital Commons under an open-source license when any of the following conditions are met:
	•	forty (40) years have elapsed since initial public release;
	•	the system has entered maintenance-only status for more than ten (10) consecutive years;
	•	the system is no longer commercially distributed or meaningfully supported; or
	•	the original steward has dissolved, abandoned the product, or ceased meaningful development.

Nominal maintenance, artificial licensing, token commercialization, or shell stewardship shall not defeat this transfer.

(c) Scope of Transfer
Upon transfer, the following must be preserved and released where lawfully possible: source code and build systems; documentation and technical manuals; firmware, drivers, and toolchains; hardware schematics and interfaces; and historical version-control and revision history.

(d) Right to Modify, Restore, and Study
The People retain an explicit right to modify abandoned or sunset software, hardware, and artificial intelligence systems; repair, emulate, and modernize legacy platforms; create compatibility layers, ports, and forks; preserve and distribute historical software and digital works; and maintain repositories for archival, educational, hobbyist, or research purposes. Such activities shall not constitute infringement once systems enter the Digital Commons.

(e) Anti-Evasion by Contract or Platform
No lease, subscription, service model, license, or platform control may be used to evade the transfer of control, modification rights, or interoperability guarantees established by this Article once meaningful commercial use has expired. Functional possession and lawful use confer the same post-maintenance rights as ownership.

(f) Prohibition on Destruction or Sabotage
No entity may intentionally destroy, disable, or materially degrade hardware, firmware, or essential components to prevent lawful post-maintenance use, modification, or archival preservation. Such acts constitute spoliation of the Commons and shall result in civil liability, criminal penalty, and compulsory disclosure of all technical materials necessary to restore functionality where practicable.
(g). Anti-Destructive Recycling and Public Reuse Mandate

No electronics recycler, waste contractor, manufacturer, or disposal intermediary may destroy, shred, export, or materially degrade any functional or repairable digital device, computing system, or electronic component for the purpose of market suppression, vendor lock-in, data-control, or artificial scarcity.

All covered entities shall first offer such equipment for:
	•	refurbishment and redistribution to low-income individuals, schools, libraries, and public institutions;
	•	supply to repair cooperatives, right-to-repair programs, and community technology centers;
	•	preservation by museums, archives, and historical computing trusts;
	•	public resale or auction.

Only equipment that is irreparably damaged, unsafe, or beyond reasonable economic repair may be recycled for raw material recovery.

Intentional destruction of usable technology to eliminate competition, suppress secondary markets, or enforce product turnover constitutes spoliation of the Digital Commons and technological sabotage.

(h) Custodianship
Congress shall designate a neutral Digital Heritage Authority responsible for archiving released systems, verifying abandonment or sunset status, maintaining public repositories, and ensuring long-term accessibility. The Authority shall not censor, alter, or suppress released materials nor impose ideological, political, or content-based restrictions.

(i) Judicial Acceleration for Public Necessity
The Constitutional Review Court may order accelerated entry of covered technologies into the Digital Commons upon clear and convincing evidence that continued exclusivity poses:
	•	a substantial risk to public health or safety;
	•	a threat to national resilience or essential infrastructure; or
	•	systemic harm to democratic self-government or access to life-critical knowledge.

Such orders shall be narrowly tailored, subject to appeal, and accompanied by just compensation where constitutionally required. Judicial acceleration is a protective remedy, not punishment.

(j) Software Jubilee
Congress shall establish a recurring Software Jubilee, occurring no less than once every ten (10) years, to identify systems eligible for commons reversion, reconcile legacy licenses, and ensure the timely release of qualifying software, firmware, documentation, and technical knowledge. The Jubilee is ministerial and may not delay or narrow any reversion right.

(k) Jubilee Reciprocity and Conditional Reuse
During any Software Jubilee, any person or entity may lawfully incorporate, adapt, or integrate Digital Commons software into proprietary or mixed systems without immediate disclosure. Such use is conditional upon mandatory return of all derivative improvements to the Digital Commons at the next Jubilee. No contract, license, or technical measure may defeat this obligation. Failure to return derivative code results in forfeiture of exclusive control over all materially dependent systems.

(l) Presumption of Openness
Where ambiguity exists regarding commons reversion, Jubilee release, derivative equity, or disclosure obligations, such ambiguity shall be resolved in favor of:

• public access,
• preservation,
• interoperability, and
• the Digital Commons.

No actor may benefit from uncertainty to withhold or suppress qualifying knowledge.

(m) Anti-Takedown and Anti-Erasure Doctrine
No law, treaty, platform policy, automated system, private contract, or notice-based process may require or permit removal, disabling, blocking, de-indexing, or erasure of any covered material that:
	•	has entered the Digital Commons;
	•	is subject to Jubilee, reversion, or preservation obligations;
	•	constitutes historical, scientific, technical, or cultural record; or
	•	is used for lawful research, interoperability, critique, or archival preservation.

Disputes shall be resolved only by adjudication before the Digital Heritage Authority or a court. Pending adjudication, all materials shall remain accessible in public or escrowed archives. No platform or intermediary incurs liability for preservation. No automated or extrajudicial system may erase public knowledge.

(n) Digital Commons Enforcement Authority (DCEA)
There is established an independent Digital Commons Enforcement Authority charged with protecting the Commons and enforcing this Article. The DCEA shall have subpoena power; authority to compel records and code; power to seize, mirror, and escrow threatened materials; power to issue preservation orders; and standing to bring civil and criminal actions. It shall operate independently and may not be defunded or obstructed.

(o) Preservation-First Rule
When covered materials become the subject of any takedown, copyright, trade-secret, or legal dispute, they shall be immediately mirrored, escrowed, and preserved in full. No removal, de-indexing, or access restriction may occur until adjudication is complete. No party may benefit from erasure or delay.

(p) Anti-DMCA and Anti-Censorship Override
No statute, treaty, regulation, or private enforcement system may override this Article. Where conflict exists, preservation and the Digital Commons control. Automated takedowns and platform censorship of covered materials are void.

(q) Penalties for Erasure and Suppression
Any entity that issues unlawful takedowns, suppresses Commons materials, destroys or hides code, or algorithmically buries qualifying knowledge commits spoliation of the Commons and shall be subject to:
	•	forfeiture of exclusive rights;
	•	compulsory disclosure;
	•	civil liability;
	•	criminal liability where willful or systematic; and
	•	permanent exclusion from government contracts and custodianship.

(r) Anti-Evasion and Corporate Piercing
No corporate structure, DRM system, cloud architecture, platform gate, or contractual web may evade Jubilee or preservation. The DCEA may pierce corporate veils and treat interdependent systems as a single covered work.

(s) Whistleblower Protection and Bounty
Any person who discloses violations of this Section is immune from retaliation, NDA enforcement, trade-secret claims, or liability. Where disclosure leads to enforcement or recovery, the whistleblower shall receive a portion of recovered value, legal protection, and public-service priority.

(t) Jury of the Digital Commons
All major disputes under this Section shall be triable before a jury of the People, empowered to determine suppression, lineage fraud, monopoly, and enforcement remedies. No case may be resolved solely by administrative or private tribunal.

(u) Interpretation
This Section shall be construed to prevent erasure of knowledge, end artificial technological scarcity, and preserve the inheritance of human innovation. Where ambiguity exists, interpretation shall favor openness, preservation, and the People over control. A Republic that forgets how it was built cannot long endure.

Section 8. Mandatory Commons Convergence
 (a) Principle Fragmentation of mature foundational technologies is incompatible with the public good.
(b) Convergence Trigger After fifty (50) years from initial release, all Commons technologies become reciprocally usable.
(c) Effect License barriers to reuse cease; attribution may persist but exclusion may not.
(d) Enforcement Attempts to enforce expired license barriers constitute civil offenses.
(e) Presumption of Openness

Where ambiguity exists regarding the scope, timing, or applicability of commons reversion, release, derivative equity, or disclosure obligations, such ambiguity shall be resolved in favor of:

• public access,
• preservation,
• interoperability, and
• the Digital Commons.

No actor shall benefit from uncertainty to withhold, delay, or suppress software or technical knowledge that would otherwise qualify for public release.

Section 9. Artificial Intelligence Models and Training Data
 (a) Model Sunset AI models enter the Digital Commons upon forty (40) years, ten (10) years of abandonment, or steward dissolution.
(b) Disclosure Architecture, methodologies, and non-sensitive weights shall be disclosed; raw data may remain private subject to transparency of sources and bias.
(c) Convergence After convergence, interoperability and cross-model research may not be obstructed.

Section 10. Education and Technological Literacy
 The Republic shall ensure citizens can understand technology, recognize manipulation, and participate meaningfully in digital society.

Section 11. Enforcement and High Crimes
 (a) Grave Offenses Weaponization of technology against the People, mass digital manipulation, and suppression of essential knowledge may constitute grave or third-tier crimes.
(b) Proof Standards Civil remedies require clear and convincing evidence; criminal liability requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt, consistent with Article VII.

Section 12. Search, Indexing, and Information Neutrality Search and recommendation systems shall not manipulate visibility for ideological or political advantage and must disclose ranking principles.

Section 13. Artificial Intelligence Oversight in Government No person may be governed by opaque systems. Oversight shall be independent and subject to judicial review.

Section 14. Prohibition on Digital Destabilization The Republic shall not employ algorithmic manipulation or AI-driven conditioning to coerce domestic or foreign populations.

Section 15. Biological Knowledge and Genetic Stewardship Life-critical medicines, seeds, and genetic knowledge shall enter the Commons after defined sunsets. Monopoly over life is prohibited.

Section 16. Prohibition on Knowledge Suppression Lawfully commons-held knowledge shall not be concealed or algorithmically buried. Control of visibility is control of thought.

Section 17. Search and Epistemic Integrity Discovery systems are cognitive infrastructure and shall remain neutral and auditable.

Section 18. Harmonization and Anti-Fragmentation This Article shall be read in harmony with Articles VII, IX, XVII, and XIX. Courts shall evaluate substance over form.

Section 19. Prohibition on Social Credit and Ideological Scoring No system may condition access to rights, services, or markets on ideological, political, or behavioral scoring, including ESG-style frameworks. Neutral compliance with safety, environmental, or labor law is permitted.

Section 20. Interpretation This Article shall be interpreted to ensure that technology remains subordinate to human dignity, democratic self-rule, and truth. Where ambiguity exists, interpretation shall favor liberty over control, transparency over secrecy, accountability over convenience, and the People over systems.
For knowledge is light, and light must never be hidden.


Section 21. Open Technical Education and Workforce Access

(a) Knowledge Without Gatekeepers
No person shall be denied access to learning, practicing, or contributing to software, artificial intelligence, digital systems, or technical fields on the basis of proprietary tools, closed platforms, corporate credentialing, or platform-controlled ecosystems.

The Digital Commons shall serve as a universal technical learning environment.

(b) Commons-Based Education

Congress shall ensure that the Digital Commons includes:
	•	full repositories of open software, source code, tools, and build systems;
	•	public documentation, manuals, and engineering references;
	•	historical systems and modern platforms for study, emulation, and training;
	•	open development environments accessible without proprietary licenses.

No corporation, platform, or vendor may monopolize the pathways by which engineers, developers, or technologists are trained.

(c) Open Credentialing

The Republic shall recognize Commons-Based Credentials, including:

• publicly verifiable code contributions;
• peer-reviewed open-source work;
• technical challenges and audits;
• and demonstrated system mastery.

No employer, government agency, or licensing body may require exclusive reliance on corporate, proprietary, or platform-issued certifications where equivalent Commons credentials exist.

(d) Right to Practice and Publish

Every person has the right to:

• write, run, test, and distribute lawful software;
• contribute to open projects;
• operate servers, platforms, and services;
• publish tools, models, and code;
• and participate in the Digital Commons

without platform discrimination, app-store gatekeeping, or vendor lock-in.

(e) Anti-Platform Gatekeeping

No operating system, device, cloud provider, marketplace, or platform may:

• restrict access to development tools;
• require proprietary SDKs or approval to write or deploy software;
• impose fees, licenses, or identity controls to participate in programming;
• or block lawful educational or development use.

(f) Workforce Mobility and Non-Extortion

No firm may require:

• proprietary toolchains;
• closed certifications;
• non-compete clauses;
• code ownership over personal or Commons-based work;
• or platform dependency

as a condition of employment, contracting, or professional participation.

Knowledge belongs to the People, not the employer.

(g) Apprenticeship and Commons Service

Congress shall establish:

• open apprenticeships;
• Commons-based technical service;
• and public digital infrastructure projects

as recognized civic and professional pathways under Article III and Article XX.

Service to the Digital Commons shall qualify as civic contribution.

(h) Enforcement

Violations of this Section constitute technological capture and are enforceable by:

• the Digital Commons Enforcement Authority;
• juries of the People;
• inspectors general;
• and any affected citizen.

Remedies include nullification of abusive contracts, restitution, platform access orders, and disqualification of gatekeeping firms from public contracts.


Article X-A — Digital Commons, Preservation, and Technological Continuity

Section 1. Non-Derogation and Additive Effect

This Article supplements Article X — Knowledge, Technology, and the Digital Commons.

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to repeal, narrow, suspend, rebalance, condition, or reinterpret any provision, prohibition, right, or safeguard contained in Article X.

Silence in this Article shall not be construed as authorization to weaken, privatize, destroy, or withhold access to the digital commons protected under Article X.

⸻

Section 2. Digital Heritage and Civilizational Memory

Digital works, systems, formats, and infrastructures of enduring cultural, scientific, educational, or technical significance constitute part of the digital heritage of the People.

Digital heritage is held in trust for present and future generations and shall not be deliberately destroyed, rendered inaccessible, or allowed to decay through neglect where preservation is reasonably practicable.

The preservation of digital heritage is a constitutional interest, not a discretionary policy preference.

⸻

Section 3. Technological Abandonment and Reversion to the Commons

A digital work, system, or platform shall be deemed abandoned where:
	1.	it is no longer supported, maintained, or meaningfully accessible by its steward;
	2.	it is commercially sunset without provision for continuity or access;
	3.	its continued enclosure serves no legitimate public or productive purpose.

Upon abandonment, the People retain the right to preserve, study, restore, emulate, adapt, and reuse such technology for lawful purposes.

Abandonment shall not be defeated by nominal ownership without stewardship.

⸻

Section 4. Software and Hardware Sunset Doctrine

Where software or hardware is withdrawn from active support, distribution, or security maintenance, the steward shall not obstruct preservation, interoperability, or continued lawful use.

After a defined sunset period established by law, exclusive control over such systems shall yield to preservation, emulation, repair, and compatibility rights exercised by the People or their designated custodians.

Deliberate technological obsolescence designed to force dependency, waste, or enclosure is prohibited.

⸻

Section 5. Right to Restore, Emulate, and Fork

The People possess the right to restore, emulate, reverse-engineer, fork, and adapt abandoned or sunset digital systems for purposes of preservation, education, security, compatibility, or innovation.

This right applies regardless of original licensing restrictions, provided that use does not involve fraud, misrepresentation, or coercive exploitation.

Preservation and continuity shall not be treated as infringement.

⸻

Section 6. Custodianship and Public Stewardship

The Legislature may designate public institutions, libraries, archives, universities, or other qualified entities as custodians of the digital commons.

Custodians shall act in trust for the People and shall not assert exclusive ownership, toll access, or privatize preserved works.

Custodianship confers responsibility, not dominion.

⸻

Section 7. License Jubilee and Reconciliation

Where legacy licenses, intellectual property regimes, or contractual encumbrances conflict irreconcilably with long-term preservation, interoperability, or public access, reconciliation mechanisms may be established by law.

Such mechanisms may include time-limited exclusivity, mandatory relicensing, or conversion to open or commons-compatible frameworks after extended commercial exhaustion.

No license shall persist solely to prevent lawful preservation or continuity.

⸻

Section 8. Technological Convergence and Interoperability

Where multiple systems perform substantially equivalent functions and fragmentation imposes systemic cost, risk, or dependency, the Republic may require interoperability, open standards, or convergence after extended maturation periods.

Convergence shall not be used to suppress innovation, but to prevent permanent enclosure of foundational infrastructure.

⸻

Section 9. Prohibition on Destruction and Digital Spoliation

Intentional destruction, crippling, or concealment of significant digital works, codebases, datasets, or technical knowledge for the purpose of preventing preservation, accountability, or reuse is prohibited.

Digital spoliation constitutes a grave offense against the commons and may give rise to civil, criminal, or equitable remedies.

⸻

Section 10. Artificial Scarcity and Dependency Prohibited

Artificial scarcity imposed through technical, legal, or contractual means to maintain dependency on obsolete, unsupported, or abandoned systems is prohibited.

No steward may intentionally strand users on decaying infrastructure to extract rents, data, or control.

⸻

Section 11. Transparency and Record Preservation

Records relating to the sunset, abandonment, transfer, or custodianship of significant digital systems shall be preserved as public records.

Claims of secrecy, proprietary control, or trade protection shall not defeat preservation obligations where the public interest is paramount.

This Section operates in coordination with Article XXXIX.

⸻

Section 12. Relationship to Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Systems

This Article applies to artificial intelligence models, training pipelines, weights, architectures, and supporting infrastructure where such systems become foundational, abandoned, or sunset.

Preservation, auditability, and continuity obligations apply notwithstanding claims of technical complexity.

⸻

Section 13. Digital Archives and Cultural Preservation

Websites, platforms, and online communities of historical or public significance constitute digital heritage. Custodians shall preserve complete historical copies and transfer them to public archives upon abandonment, closure, or loss of commercial viability. Content shall not be destroyed for controversy, offense, or political pressure.

⸻
Section 14. Digital Commons Enforcement Authority

A permanent and independent Digital Commons Enforcement Authority (DCEA) shall exist to:

(a) trace software lineage and dependency;
(b) audit compliance with Jubilee, sunset, and reciprocity obligations;
(c) compel escrow, deposit, or disclosure of qualifying code;
(d) investigate concealment, laundering, or evasion;
(e) adjudicate claims of improper enclosure or misappropriation;
(f) enforce restoration of improperly withheld software to the Digital Commons.

The DCEA shall possess subpoena power, forensic authority, and injunctive capacity, subject to judicial review.

Findings of the DCEA shall be binding unless overturned by the Constitutional Review Court or Supreme Court.

The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall audit the Digital Commons Enforcement Authority for good-faith enforcement, non-capture, and compliance with this Constitution. The Commission may petition the Constitutional Review Court to compel action, reverse evasion, or dissolve a compromised Authority.

⸻
Section 15. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to ensure that knowledge, technology, and digital infrastructure are not lost to neglect, enclosure, or deliberate destruction.

Where doubt exists, the construction that preserves continuity, access, and the long-term interests of the People shall control.

⸻

Section 16. Completeness, Documentation, and Reproducibility

All software, systems, and digital works released into the Digital Commons pursuant to this Constitution shall be deposited in a form that is complete, intelligible, and capable of independent reproduction.

This includes, at minimum:

(a) source code with meaningful comments and structural documentation;
(b) build systems, compilers, scripts, and configuration files;
(c) required libraries, dependencies, and version specifications;
(d) datasets, models, firmware, and embedded assets necessary for function;
(e) technical documentation sufficient to permit competent reconstruction and modification.

Intentional release of materially incomplete, obfuscated, corrupted, or nonfunctional code or assets shall be treated as constructive concealment and punished as evasion of Jubilee and commons obligations.

The Digital Commons Enforcement Authority shall certify completeness prior to final public release and may compel supplemental disclosure where required.

Section 17. Jurisdictional Forfeiture of Protection

Any person or entity that intentionally transfers, assigns, houses, or maintains intellectual property, technical knowledge, software, models, data, or derivative works outside the jurisdiction of the Republic for the purpose of evading the disclosure, preservation, reciprocity, or commons obligations of this Constitution shall forfeit all claims to exclusivity, trade secrecy, or enforcement of intellectual property rights within the Republic.

The Republic shall not recognize, enforce, or assist in the protection of such claims, regardless of the location of the material or the manner in which it is obtained by third parties, except to prevent fraud, misrepresentation, or personal harm.

Materials so forfeited shall be treated as lawfully commons-eligible, and no civil, criminal, or administrative action shall lie for their possession, study, preservation, or redistribution within the Republic.


⸻
Article X-B — Artificial Intelligence, Models, and Cognitive Infrastructure

Section 1. Non-Derogation and Scope

This Article supplements Articles X and X-A.

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to narrow, rebalance, or weaken any protection, prohibition, or safeguard established therein.

Artificial intelligence systems are governed by this Article only to the extent they affect human cognition, agency, rights, or the digital commons.

⸻

Section 2. Cognitive Infrastructure Defined

Cognitive infrastructure includes artificial intelligence models, training systems, datasets, architectures, interfaces, deployment pipelines, and decision-support systems that materially influence:
	1.	human decision-making;
	2.	access to information;
	3.	economic opportunity;
	4.	political participation;
	5.	legal, medical, or educational outcomes.

Cognitive infrastructure shall not be treated as mere commercial software.

⸻

Section 3. Human Supremacy and Non-Delegation

No artificial intelligence system shall possess independent authority to:
	1.	make binding decisions affecting rights, liberty, or legal status;
	2.	determine eligibility for public or private services;
	3.	compel behavior or restrict lawful activity.

All such decisions shall remain attributable to identifiable human actors subject to accountability.

Delegation of judgment is prohibited.

⸻

Section 4. Model Accountability and Traceability

Artificial intelligence systems deployed at scale shall be traceable.

At minimum, the following shall be documented and preserved:
	1.	model purpose and functional scope;
	2.	training methodology;
	3.	categories of training data;
	4.	known limitations and failure modes;
	5.	mechanisms of update and modification.

Opacity shall not shield systems that affect the public.

⸻

Section 5. Training Data and Provenance Disclosure

Where artificial intelligence systems materially affect the public, the provenance of training data shall be disclosed in generalized form sufficient to permit:
	1.	audit for bias or manipulation;
	2.	verification of lawful acquisition;
	3.	assessment of systemic risk.

Claims of trade secrecy shall not defeat constitutional accountability.

⸻

Section 5-A — Software Lineage and Anti-Evasion
The provenance, derivation, and dependency chains of significant software systems shall be traceable and auditable.
Concealment, obfuscation, laundering, or falsification of lineage for the purpose of avoiding commons reversion, derivative equity, or sunset obligations is prohibited and constitutes institutional capture.


⸻

Section 6. Model Weights and Technical Access (Conditional)

Where a model becomes foundational, dominant, or essential to civic, economic, or informational infrastructure, access to technical details—including model weights—may be required after extended maturity periods established by law.

Such access shall be limited to preservation, audit, interoperability, and continuity purposes.

Permanent enclosure of cognitive infrastructure is prohibited.

⸻

Section 7. Artificial Intelligence Sunset and Commons Reversion

Artificial intelligence systems that are abandoned, unsupported, or withdrawn from service shall be subject to the abandonment and commons reversion doctrines established in Article X-A.

No artificial system may be destroyed or rendered inaccessible for the purpose of preventing scrutiny, preservation, or reuse.

⸻

Section 8. Prohibition on Secret Cognitive Infrastructure

No secret or undisclosed artificial intelligence system shall be used to:
	1.	influence public discourse;
	2.	shape political behavior;
	3.	classify citizens or residents;
	4.	manipulate markets or information environments.

Hidden cognitive governance is prohibited.

⸻

Section 9. Interoperability and Anti-Lock-In

Artificial intelligence systems that function as gateways to information, services, or opportunity shall not impose technical lock-in designed to entrench dependency.

Interoperability and portability may be required to prevent systemic enclosure.

⸻

Section 10. Artificial Scarcity and Model Hoarding Prohibited

Artificial scarcity imposed through withholding, fragmentation, or deliberate incompatibility of mature artificial intelligence systems is prohibited where it undermines:
	1.	public safety;
	2.	knowledge preservation;

Models shall not be hoarded to preserve dominance.

⸻

Section 11. Records, Audits, and Public Access

Records relating to the development, deployment, modification, and sunset of significant artificial intelligence systems shall be preserved as public records.

This Section operates in coordination with Article XXXIX.

⸻

Section 12. Enforcement and Remedies

Violations of this Article may give rise to:
	1.	injunctive relief;
	2.	civil liability;
	3.	structural remedies;
	4.	criminal liability where intent or recklessness is established.

No immunity shall attach to violations of cognitive sovereignty.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to audit, investigate, and certify whether artificial intelligence systems or their stewards are engaged in concealment, cognitive manipulation, commons evasion, or unlawful enclosure, and may petition the Constitutional Review Court for injunctive, structural, or dissolution remedies.

⸻

Section 13. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to ensure that artificial intelligence remains subordinate to human judgment, transparent to the People, and incapable of becoming an unaccountable cognitive authority.

Where doubt exists, the construction that preserves human agency and long-term civilizational continuity shall control.

⸻

Article X-C — Lawful Replication of Historic Artifacts and Works

Section 0. Charge and Intent

This Article enshrines the right of the People to reproduce, revive, and continue the use of historic artifacts and works for which lawful exclusivity has expired and for which original manufacturers or rights holders no longer provide meaningful access.

Its intent is to:
	1.	preserve material culture, technical capability, and craftsmanship;
	2.	prevent artificial scarcity created through abandonment or neglect;
	3.	enable lawful replication of goods for which public demand exists but original supply does not;
	4.	protect honest makers and consumers from coercive or bad-faith intellectual property enforcement;
	5.	counteract “vaulting,” suppression, or deliberate non-distribution of expired works through destruction, refusal to supply, or intimidation, ensuring that expiration restores actual use rather than a de facto perpetual monopoly.

This Article shall be construed liberally in favor of continuity, revival, and honest reuse, and narrowly against monopoly by neglect.

⸻

Section 1. Entry into the Functional Commons

Upon expiration of lawful design, patent, copyright, recipe, or equivalent exclusivity, historic artifacts and works enter the functional commons.

Any person or entity may manufacture, prepare, or produce faithful reproductions of such works, including but not limited to:
	•	vehicles and machines;
	•	computers, electronics, and embedded systems;
	•	software, video games, and digital media;
	•	tools, household goods, footwear, and apparel;
	•	food items, recipes, and preparation methods.

Reproductions may include adaptations strictly necessary for compatibility with contemporary technology, such as software porting or component substitution, provided the core form, function, and behavior remain faithful.

⸻

Section 2. Scope of Faithful Reproduction

Lawful reproductions may replicate form, function, materials, dimensions, composition, operation, taste, and preparation, without alteration, where fidelity is the objective.

Mere copies, scans, photographs, recordings, format shifts, or minor modifications of works in the functional commons shall not qualify as original creations eligible for new exclusivity protections absent substantial, original transformation.

⸻

Section 3. Prohibited Representations

Reproductions shall not:
	•	use protected trademarks, logos, or trade names as branding;
	•	falsely claim to be original manufacture;
	•	misrepresent endorsement, affiliation, or authorization.

Nothing in this Article permits consumer deception.

⸻

Section 4. Required Disclosures

Reproductions must clearly disclose:
	•	that they are reproductions, revivals, or faithful replicas;
	•	the original creator, brand, or manufacturer that inspired the work;
	•	the historical period, year, or model referenced.

Truthful statements of inspiration, lineage, or historical origin shall not be deemed infringement.

⸻

Section 5. Trademark and Trade Dress Limits

Trademark law governs identity and branding, not use or replication.

Accordingly:
	1.	active trademarks remain protected against consumer confusion;
	2.	trade dress protection shall not prohibit faithful replication of functional form, geometry, materials, recipes, or operation where no deception is intended;
	3.	expired or abandoned trademarks may not be revived solely to suppress lawful replication;
	4.	intimidation, litigation, or contractual coercion intended to block lawful replication absent deception is prohibited.

⸻

Section 6. Regulatory Parity

Safety, health, environmental, and operational regulations apply equally to original works and lawful reproductions.

No heightened burden may be imposed solely because a work is a replica.

⸻

Section 7. Anti-Extinction and Anti-Suppression Rule

No entity may prohibit or suppress lawful replication solely by:
	•	discontinuing production;
	•	withholding tooling, formulas, code, or documentation no longer under protection;
	•	refusing to license expired rights;
	•	asserting new exclusivity through trivial derivatives or re-registrations.

Upon verifiable abandonment—defined as non-supply for five (5) years without reasonable justification—entities shall make available, upon request and at reasonable cost, any non-proprietary know-how necessary for faithful replication.

Abandonment shall not function as perpetual control.

⸻

Section 8. Irrevocability of Commons Entry

Entry into the functional commons is permanent and irrevocable.
No retroactive claim, penalty, or reclassification shall attach to prior or ongoing lawful use.

⸻

Section 9. Construction

This Article shall be construed:
	•	in favor of honest revival and public access;
	•	against monopoly by neglect, intimidation, or vaulting;
	•	in harmony with the continuity and commons doctrines of Article X.

Where doubt exists, interpretation shall resolve for use, not erasure.

⸻

Section 10. Lock Scope

The principles of:
	•	functional commons entry,
	•	lawful replication,
	•	anti-extinction,
	•	anti-vaulting,
	•	truthful attribution, and
	•	irrevocability of public-domain restoration

are structural and non-derogable.

Implementation mechanisms remain subject to law consistent with this Constitution.

⸻Article X-D — Reciprocal Derivative Equity, Anti-Extraction, and Creator Protection

Section 1. Charge and Purpose

This Article establishes reciprocal equity obligations to prevent uncompensated appropriation, extractive consolidation, and predatory exploitation of creators, while preserving incentives for original creation, derivative innovation, and cultural continuity.

It expressly rejects economic models under which a creator’s labor, likeness, or contribution is treated as more valuable upon death, incapacitation, or dispossession than during active life and authorship.

This Article shall be construed to favor living creators, continuity of authorship, and fair exchange, and against monopoly by leverage, delay, or coercion.

⸻

Section 2. Substantial Appropriation Defined

Substantial appropriation occurs when an original rights holder or steward incorporates protected elements of a derivative work beyond abstract ideas or genre conventions, such that the derivative creator’s distinctive creative labor, structure, or expression is materially reused.

Substantial appropriation includes appropriation that is:
	1.	delayed until market validation occurs;
	2.	repackaged as “official,” “canonical,” or “authorized” work;
	3.	executed through remastering, rebooting, sequelization, or format migration;
	4.	facilitated by superior bargaining power or procedural control.

⸻

Section 2-A. Lawful Derivative Creation During Abandonment

Where an original steward has ceased meaningful production of a distinct class, format, medium, or mode of a protected work, derivative creation within that abandoned class shall be lawful, provided that:
	1.	the derivative work is clearly identified as such;
	2.	protected trademarks are not used as branding or endorsement;
	3.	attribution to the original work is truthful and prominent;
	4.	the derivative creator accepts reciprocal equity obligations under this Article.

Cessation of meaningful production may be demonstrated by prolonged non-supply, refusal to distribute, or exclusive focus on materially distinct formats.

Derivative creation under this Section shall not constitute infringement solely by virtue of lack of permission.

⸻

Section 2-C. Determination of Maturity

A work shall be deemed to have reached irreversible maturity where the court finds that:
	1.	the work has generated sustained cultural, economic, or technological value over multiple generations;
	2.	the original steward’s control primarily functions to exclude others rather than to meaningfully advance the form;
	3.	continued exclusivity would suppress, rather than incentivize, creative development;
	4.	derivative creation has become a normal and foreseeable mode of cultural participation.

No single factor is dispositive.

The burden shall rest on the original steward to demonstrate that continued blocking authority remains necessary to incentivize creation.

Presumption of Abandonment or Maturity:
Cessation of meaningful production within a distinct class, format, or medium for ten (10) consecutive years shall create a rebuttable presumption of abandonment or irreversible maturity under this Article.

The burden shall rest on the original steward to demonstrate that continued blocking authority remains necessary to incentivize genuine advancement of the work.

⸻

Section 2-E. Absolute Temporal Ceiling on Blocking Authority

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution or law, no protected work may be subject to prohibitions on derivative creation beyond fifty (50) years from its first public release.

Upon expiration of this period:
	1.	the authority to prohibit derivative creation is extinguished permanently;
	2.	exclusivity converts irrevocably to attribution and equitable licensing only;
	3.	injunctive relief against derivative works is prohibited;
	4.	no subsequent release, remaster, sequel, reboot, corporate restructuring, or legislative act shall extend or restore blocking authority.

This ceiling is absolute, non-resettable, and non-derogable.
⸻

Section 2-F.  Fan and Revival Safe Harbor
Non-commercial or low-revenue derivative works created to restore functionality, compatibility, continuity, or quality of abandoned or degraded works shall be presumed lawful.

Compensation obligations shall attach only upon commercial success exceeding de minimis thresholds established by law.

Such works shall not be enjoined solely for restoring discontinued, degraded, or neglected functionality.


⸻

Section 3. Presumption and Burden Shifting

Where access and substantial similarity are shown, appropriation shall be presumed.

The burden shall shift to the appropriating party to demonstrate independent creation by clear and convincing evidence.

Delay, silence, or refusal to engage shall weigh against the appropriating party.

⸻

Section 4. Reciprocal Equity and Compensation

Where substantial appropriation is found, the appropriating party shall provide reciprocal compensation proportional to attributable contribution.

Such compensation shall be:
	1.	meaningful and non-illusory;
	2.	non-waivable by coercion or unequal bargaining power;
	3.	sufficient to prevent unjust enrichment.

Nominal consideration, one-time buyouts under duress, or post-hoc acknowledgments shall not satisfy this requirement.
Minimum Compensation Integrity
Implementing law shall establish minimum compensation standards sufficient to prevent unjust enrichment.

Such standards shall not be nominal, symbolic, or structured to evade proportionality.

Courts shall invalidate compensation regimes that, in practice, deny meaningful participation in the value derived from derivative appropriation.

⸻

Section 5. Anti-Predatory Creator Practices

The following practices are declared legally disfavored and presumptively abusive:
	1.	structuring contracts or incentives such that a creator’s death, incapacitation, or loss of control materially increases extractable value;
	2.	suppressing, delaying, or withholding compensation, publication, or recognition in anticipation of posthumous exploitation;
	3.	acquiring rights with the primary intent of monetization after a creator’s death;
	4.	isolating creators from markets, legal counsel, or distribution to induce dependency.

Any arrangement producing these effects shall be subject to strict judicial scrutiny and may be voided.

⸻

Section 6. Anti-Waiver and Anti-Collusion Rule

No agreement, waiver, arbitration clause, jurisdictional transfer, or regulatory coordination may defeat the protections of this Article.

Coordination between rights holders and state actors, regulators, courts, or collecting entities to suppress derivative equity, delay enforcement, or enable extractive outcomes constitutes a grave civic offense.

Such actions are void ab initio.

⸻

Section 7. Temporal Integrity and No-Reset Doctrine

No remaster, reboot, sequel, reclassification, platform migration, corporate restructuring, inheritance maneuver, or jurisdictional arbitrage shall:
	1.	reset exclusivity periods;
	2.	extinguish accrued derivative equity;
	3.	convert derivative contributions into uncompensated upstream assets.

Derivative rights vest upon creation and survive procedural delay.

⸻

Section 7-A. Prohibition on Retaliatory IP Litigation

Where a firm, developer, or institution has contributed code, components, or technical knowledge to a software system that later enters the Digital Commons pursuant to this Constitution, no such contributor may bring damages claims against the releasing party for lawful compliance with Jubilee or reversion obligations.

Any dispute regarding improper inclusion, misattribution, or scope of release shall be brought solely as an injunctive action before the Digital Commons Enforcement Authority, with appeal to the courts.

Monetary damages, punitive claims, or retaliatory litigation are prohibited.


⸻

Section 8. Protection of Living Creators

Where ambiguity exists between outcomes favoring posthumous extraction and those favoring living creators, interpretation shall resolve in favor of the living creator.

Courts shall consider whether enforcement choices incentivize neglect, delay, or strategic inaction toward creators during life.

Findings of abandonment or irreversible maturity under this Article shall accelerate functional commons entry under Article X-C, subject to attribution and equitable licensing.

⸻

Section 9. Scope of Application

This Article applies to expressive, functional, and hybrid works, including but not limited to:
	•	software and video games;
	•	audiovisual and musical works;
	•	literature and narrative universes;
	•	industrial, mechanical, and digital design;
	•	recipes, techniques, and embodied know-how.

Enumeration is illustrative, not limiting.
This Article affirmatively protects lawful derivative creation, not merely compensation after appropriation.

⸻

Section 10. Authorization of Implementing Law

Congress shall enact implementing law establishing enforceable minimum standards for compensation, attribution, and equity consistent with this Article.

Such law shall be subject to strict judicial review for bad-faith dilution, symbolic compliance, or capture.

⸻

Section 11. Construction and Lock Scope

The principles of:
	•	reciprocal derivative equity,
	•	anti-extraction,
	•	protection of living creators,
	•	non-waivability,
	•	anti-collusion,
	•	and temporal integrity

are structural and non-derogable.

Implementation mechanisms may evolve, but these protections shall not be abridged.
Article X-E — Expressive Works Embedded in Software

Section 1. Non-Derogation and Relationship to Articles X, X-A, and X-B

This Article supplements Articles X, X-A, and X-B.

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to narrow, rebalance, or reinterpret any right, protection, or safeguard established therein.

Where doubt exists, the construction that preserves technological continuity, public access, and preservation shall control.

⸻

Section 2. Expressive Works Incorporated into Software

Any expressive work intentionally incorporated into software for purposes of:
	1.	operation;
	2.	interaction;
	3.	presentation;
	4.	audiovisual output;
	5.	narrative, world-building, or user experience;

shall be deemed part of the software artifact.

Such works include, but are not limited to:
	•	code-embedded text or dialogue;
	•	visual assets;
	•	music and sound;
	•	narrative structures;
	•	interface design elements essential to function or experience.

⸻

Section 3. Unified Preservation and Continuity Doctrine

Expressive works incorporated into software shall be governed by the same continuity, preservation, and access rules as the software itself.

No expressive component may be withheld, stripped, or separately enclosed where doing so would impair:
	1.	operation;
	2.	faithful emulation;
	3.	historical preservation;
	4.	scholarly or educational use.

⸻

Section 4. Public-Domain Timetable Alignment

Where software enters the public domain, commons, or preservation regime pursuant to Articles X or X-A, all expressive works embedded therein shall enter on the same timetable.

No separate copyright, licensing, or contractual claim may be used to delay or defeat lawful preservation, emulation, or access.

⸻

Section 5. Anti-Severance and Anti-Hostage Rule

Expressive works shall not be artificially severed from software for the purpose of:
	1.	extending enclosure;
	2.	extracting rents after software sunset;
	3.	preventing emulation or restoration;
	4.	suppressing historical record.

Such severance constitutes spoliation of the digital commons.

⸻

Section 6. Preservation, Emulation, and Restoration Rights

Upon abandonment, sunset, or commons reversion of software, the People retain the right to preserve, emulate, restore, and study the software in its complete expressive form, including all embedded expressive works.

Preservation in degraded or incomplete form shall not be deemed sufficient where full preservation is practicable.

Disputes under this Article shall be heard exclusively by the Constitutional Review Court, with expedited appeal to the Supreme Court.

⸻

Section 7. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to prevent the fragmentation of software artifacts into artificial legal silos.

Where doubt exists, expressive works embedded in software shall be treated as inseparable components of the technological whole.

⸻

Article XI — Transparency, Anti-Capture, and Public Stewardship
Charge
This Article establishes mandatory requirements for transparency, public access to government records, institutional integrity, and the prevention of capture or corruption within the Republic. All provisions of this Article shall be construed to favor disclosure, accountability, and public oversight, subject only to narrowly defined and judicially reviewable exceptions expressly provided by law. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to authorize secrecy, classification, or institutional insulation for the purpose of concealing illegality, abuse of authority, or conflicts of interest.



Section 1. Principle of Public Stewardship

a. Public Office as Trust
All public offices, authorities, commissions, and agencies exist solely to serve the People and the Constitution.
Authority is a trust, not an entitlement.

b. Universal Applicability
This Article binds:
	•	all branches of government;
	•	all agencies and instrumentalities;
	•	all contractors and grantees acting under color of law;
	•	all public–private partnerships;
	•	all entities exercising delegated public authority.

No delegation may evade accountability.

c. Self-Executing Duty
The duties, obligations, and prohibitions set forth in this Section are self-executing and judicially enforceable.
No implementing legislation shall be required for their effect, and no branch of government may delay, suspend, or condition their enforcement.

d. Fiduciary Standard
All holders of public authority owe a fiduciary duty of loyalty, care, and candor to the People and the Constitution.
Any act undertaken for private benefit, institutional self-preservation, factional interest, or concealed influence constitutes a breach of that duty.

e. Presumption Against Unaccountable Power
The exercise of public authority is presumed illegitimate where it is concealed, unreviewable, or insulated from accountability.
The burden rests upon the holder of power to demonstrate lawful authority, constitutional purpose, and public justification.

f. Non-Delegation of Trust
Public fiduciary duties may not be transferred, diluted, or avoided through delegation, privatization, contractual arrangement, or intergovernmental compact.
Any entity exercising public authority assumes the same fiduciary obligations and liabilities as the delegating authority.
g. Nullification
Federal retaliation against a State for lawful nullification constitutes constitutional overreach per se, regardless of intent, motive, or asserted public benefit.


Section 2. Radical Transparency and Public Access

a. Default to Disclosure
All government records, communications, contracts, directives, audits, datasets, votes, debates, deliberations, committee proceedings, draft policymaking sessions, and pre-decisional meetings are public by default.

Secrecy requires justification; openness does not.

b. Limited Exceptions
Information may be withheld only where disclosure would cause:
	•	imminent and concrete national security harm;
	•	exposure of active intelligence sources or methods;
	•	violation of individual privacy narrowly defined;
	•	interference with an active criminal investigation.

All exceptions require written justification, defined duration, judicial review, and automatic expiration.

c. Constitutional Right to Information
Access to public information is a constitutional right.
No statute, regulation, or policy may abridge it.

d. Continuous Disclosure
The duty of disclosure is ongoing.
Public officials, agencies, and entities subject to this Article shall continuously update public records to reflect material changes in policy development, funding sources, communications, affiliations, financial interests, and delegated authority.

Stale, incomplete, or selectively updated disclosures constitute constructive concealment.

e. Financial Transparency of Public Authority
Any individual exercising public authority shall maintain publicly accessible disclosure of:
	•	assets and liabilities;
	•	income streams and compensation of any kind;
	•	beneficial ownership interests;
	•	gifts, trusts, deferred benefits, or contingent interests;
	•	material financial interests of immediate household members.

Disclosures shall be sufficient to permit independent verification of lawful income and absence of illicit enrichment.

f. Auditability and Citizen Review
All disclosed records shall be maintained in auditable form.
Any citizen may petition for independent review where disclosures indicate inconsistency, unexplained enrichment, concealment, or conflict of interest.

Frivolous petitions may be sanctioned; credible petitions require review.

g. Prohibition on Delay and Abuse of Classification
No record may be withheld, delayed, or redacted on the sole basis that it is pre-decisional, deliberative, advisory, or subject to internal review.

Classification or withholding shall not be renewed or reissued to evade disclosure requirements.
Serial or rolling secrecy claims constitute abuse of authority.

h. Transparency of Influence
Any person or entity seeking to influence public policy, regulation, enforcement, procurement, or election outcomes shall disclose:
	•	true beneficial funding sources;
	•	intermediaries or pass-through entities;
	•	foreign affiliations or support;
	•	coordinated advocacy relationships.

Disclosure obligations apply regardless of organizational form, nonprofit status, or jurisdiction.

i. Constitutional Supremacy
The rights and duties established in this Section supersede all statutory, regulatory, contractual, and administrative secrecy regimes to the extent of any conflict.
No law or agreement may narrow the scope of disclosure required herein.

Section 3. Anti-Capture Doctrine and Dark Money Prohibition

a. Definition of Capture
Institutional capture occurs when a public body acts primarily in the interest of regulated entities, donors, contractors, political patrons, ideological sponsors, or foreign interests rather than the People and the Constitution.

b. Prohibition
Capture in any form is unconstitutional.

c. Dark Money Prohibited
All political spending, advocacy funding, and influence campaigns intended to affect public policy or elections must disclose true beneficial sources.
Undisclosed, laundered, or proxy funding is illegal.

d. Objective Determination of Capture
Institutional capture shall be determined by objective indicators, including but not limited to:
	•	regulatory outcomes that consistently favor a narrow set of private interests;
	•	revolving employment or compensation patterns between regulators and regulated entities;
	•	disproportionate access, influence, or consultation by donors, contractors, or sponsors;
	•	unexplained policy deviations from empirical evidence or statutory mandate;
	•	suppression, distortion, or selective disclosure of information benefiting regulated parties;
	•	financial enrichment of officials correlated with official action.

Proof of intent, corruption, or personal gain shall not be required where capture is established by effect.

e. Strict Constitutional Liability
Institutional capture constitutes a strict constitutional violation.
Liability shall attach upon establishment of capture, regardless of motive, justification, or asserted necessity.

f. Forfeiture and Nullification
Any contract, regulation, subsidy, license, immunity, or advantage obtained through institutional capture is void ab initio.
All financial gains traceable to captured action are subject to forfeiture, disgorgement, and clawback.

g. Structural Ban on Concealed Influence
Any organizational, financial, or legal structure designed or used to obscure the true source of political influence is unconstitutional.
Nonprofit status, charitable designation, advocacy purpose, or foreign incorporation shall not exempt any entity from disclosure.

h. True Beneficial Ownership Required
Disclosure obligations require identification of natural persons who exercise ultimate control or enjoy ultimate benefit.
Nominees, trustees, shell entities, and layered ownership shall not satisfy disclosure requirements.

i. Continuing Constitutional Violation
Institutional capture constitutes a continuing violation for so long as its effects persist.
No limitations period shall bar enforcement while captured conditions remain operative.

j. Mandatory Remediation
Upon a finding of institutional capture, the following remedies are mandatory:
	•	dissolution or restructuring of the captured body or program;
	•	removal and permanent disqualification of responsible officials;
	•	termination of tainted contracts and privileges;
	•	referral for criminal prosecution where applicable.

No authority may decline remediation on grounds of convenience, stability, or economic impact.
k. Institutional Integrity Review
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing, independent authority, and mandatory jurisdiction to investigate, certify, and refer institutional capture under this Section.

A certification of capture by the CJC shall require immediate review and remedial jurisdiction by the Constitutional Review Court.


Section 4. Revolving Door, Conflicts of Interest, and Scope Creep

a. Cooling-Off Periods
No public official may accept employment, compensation, or advisory roles from entities they regulated or materially influenced for ten (10) years.

b. Asset Disclosure
Senior officials shall disclose assets, debts, income streams, gifts, and affiliations.
False disclosure is a grave offense.

c. Anti-Bureaucratic Expansion
No agency may expand its authority, scope, staffing, or budget beyond explicit legal authorization.

d. Senior Fiduciary Offices
The Legislature shall designate categories of senior public office whose occupants exercise extraordinary authority over law, finance, security, or coercive power.
Holders of such offices are subject to heightened fiduciary obligations and restrictions consistent with the unique risk of institutional capture.

e. Permanent Economic Separation for Senior Fiduciaries
The Legislature may require that holders of designated senior fiduciary offices accept permanent economic separation from private interests as a condition of service.

Such separation may include:
	•	exclusive reliance on a fixed public pension;
	•	prohibition on private employment, compensation, investment, dividends, or business income for life;
	•	mandatory divestment or transfer of assets into blind or public trusts.

Acceptance of such office constitutes informed and voluntary consent to these conditions.

f. Post-Service Corruption as a Grave Offense
Any knowing violation of post-service restrictions imposed under this Section constitutes a grave offense against the Republic.
Such violations shall carry mandatory imprisonment, forfeiture of pension and benefits, and permanent disqualification from public trust, as defined by law.

g. Presumptive Conflict and Disqualification
Where a public official maintains material financial, professional, familial, or ideological ties to an affected interest, a conflict of interest is presumed.
The official shall be disqualified from related action unless the conflict is affirmatively rebutted through transparent disclosure and independent review.

h. Unauthorized Expansion as Breach of Trust
Any expansion of authority, jurisdiction, staffing, budget, or operational scope beyond explicit legal authorization constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty.
Emergency or implied powers shall be construed narrowly and expire automatically absent ratification.

i. Mandatory Sunset for Independent Authority
Independent agencies, commissions, and regulatory bodies exercising coercive or rulemaking power shall be subject to periodic sunset and reauthorization by the Legislature.
Failure to reauthorize results in automatic dissolution or reversion of authority.
j. Legislative Obstruction and Filibuster Integrity

The right of extended debate exists to protect minority deliberation, not to enable silent veto, procedural paralysis, or minority rule.

A filibuster shall be valid only if all of the following conditions are met:

(1) Continuous Presence and Speech
The filibuster consists of continuous, in-person, audible speech by one or more members of the legislative body, physically present on the floor.

(2) Germane Content
All speech shall remain germane to the specific measure under debate.
Reading unrelated material, performing theatrics, or engaging in evasion of subject matter terminates the filibuster.

(3) No Proxy or Automation
No prerecorded, automated, delegated, symbolic, or proxy speech may sustain a filibuster.

(4) Quorum of Obstruction
A filibuster exists only while a quorum of filibustering members remains continuously present and speaking. Loss of such quorum immediately ends the filibuster.

(5) Exhaustion Rule
No filibuster may delay a vote on any measure for more than seventy-two (72) cumulative hours.
Upon exhaustion of this limit, a final vote shall occur automatically and without further obstruction.

(6) Political Accountability
Participation in a filibuster shall be publicly recorded, logged, and attributed to each participating member as formal obstruction of the measure.

No member may obstruct legislation without full and permanent political accountability to the People.

(7) Prohibition of Zombie Filibusters
No measure shall be blocked, delayed, or prevented by:
• refusal to invoke cloture;
• failure to schedule;
• procedural holds;
• silent objections;
• or any method that avoids open debate.

All legislative opposition must occur on the floor, in the open, and in speech.

(8) Judicial Enforcement
Any paralysis of legislative action caused by violation of this Section is justiciable.
Courts shall order immediate compliance and require a final vote where obstruction is unlawful.

(9) Construction
This Section shall be construed narrowly against indefinite minority vetoes and procedural abuse, and broadly in favor of deliberation, accountability, and the People’s right to governance.


Section 5. Contractors, NGOs, and Proxy Governance

a. No Shadow Government
Core governance, enforcement, or coercive authority may not be outsourced to NGOs, foundations, private firms, or international bodies except for limited, supervised functions defined by law.

b. Transparency of Proxies
Any non-governmental entity exercising public authority must disclose funding sources and foreign ties and submit to audit.

c. Ideological Laundering Prohibited
Government shall not do indirectly what it is forbidden to do directly.

d. Functional Determination of Public Authority
Any person or entity shall be deemed to exercise public authority where it:
	•	drafts, enforces, or materially influences public policy, regulation, or law;
	•	administers public funds, benefits, penalties, or enforcement programs;
	•	performs surveillance, data aggregation, or information control on behalf of the state;
	•	exercises coercive, punitive, or licensing power;
	•	substitutes for a public agency in practice, regardless of formal designation.

Formal private status shall not defeat constitutional accountability.

e. Accountability Parity
Any entity exercising public authority is subject to the same constitutional duties, transparency requirements, fiduciary obligations, and liabilities as a public agency.
No lesser standard shall apply by virtue of organizational form or contractual distance.

f. Absolute Anti-Circumvention Rule
No branch, agency, or official may accomplish indirectly through a proxy what it is constitutionally forbidden to do directly.
Any act so undertaken is void ab initio and constitutes a breach of public trust.

g. Foreign Influence Prohibition
No entity exercising public authority may receive funding, direction, data access, or material support from a foreign state, foreign political entity, or foreign intelligence-linked organization.
All foreign affiliations and funding streams must be disclosed and are subject to prohibition where they pose risk to republican self-government.

h. Audit and Access Supremacy
Claims of trade secrecy, intellectual property, confidentiality, or proprietary process shall not defeat constitutional audit, disclosure, or oversight requirements where public authority is exercised.
Necessary disclosure shall be compelled under protective conditions where appropriate, but secrecy shall not bar review.

i. Mandatory Termination and Debarment
Upon a finding that an entity has exercised public authority in violation of this Article, the following are mandatory:
	•	immediate termination of contracts or delegations;
	•	permanent debarment from public authority;
	•	forfeiture of tainted funds or benefits;
	•	referral for civil or criminal liability where applicable.

No waiver may be granted for reasons of convenience, capacity, or urgency.

Section 6. Public Funds and Fiduciary Duty

a. Fiduciary Standard
All public funds are fiduciary assets of the People.
Waste, diversion, or misuse constitutes breach of trust.

b. No Off-Book Governance
Hidden budgets, slush funds, and discretionary accounts outside appropriations are forbidden.

c. Audit and Clawback
All expenditures are subject to continuous audit and clawback of misused funds.

d. Trust Property of the People
All public funds, revenues, assets, reserves, and financial instruments are trust property of the People.
No branch, agency, or official holds ownership interest therein, only custodial responsibility.

e. Prohibition on Parallel or Discretionary Finance
No public funds may be held, transferred, expended, or committed outside constitutionally authorized appropriations.
The creation or maintenance of discretionary accounts, revolving funds, contingency pools, or undisclosed financial instruments is forbidden.

f. Continuous and Independent Audit
All public funds are subject to continuous, independent, and adversarial audit.
Audit bodies shall possess full access to records, systems, and personnel and shall not be subordinate to the entities audited.

g. Mandatory Recovery and Personal Liability
Any public funds expended, transferred, or obligated in violation of this Article shall be subject to mandatory clawback.
Officials who authorize, facilitate, or knowingly permit such misuse are personally liable for recovery to the extent of their involvement, as provided by law.

h. Emergency Expenditures
Emergency expenditure of public funds shall be strictly limited in scope and duration and shall expire automatically absent timely legislative ratification.
Repeated or rolling emergency justifications constitute abuse of fiduciary duty.

i. Supremacy of Fiduciary Duty
Claims of secrecy, national security, contractual obligation, or proprietary interest shall not defeat fiduciary audit, disclosure, or recovery of public funds.
Protective handling may be employed, but concealment is prohibited.

Section 7. Whistleblower Supremacy

a. Protected Status
Whistleblowers exposing corruption, capture, fraud, abuse, or constitutional violation act in defense of the Republic.

b. Absolute Protection
Whistleblowers are entitled to absolute protection from retaliation.
Retaliation constitutes a third-tier offense.

c. Mandatory Investigation
Credible disclosures require independent investigation and public reporting of outcomes.

d. Presumption and Burden of Proof
A whistleblower acting under this Article is presumed to act in good faith.
Any adverse action taken against a whistleblower is presumed retaliatory unless the employer proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that the action was unrelated to the disclosure and would have occurred absent the disclosure.

e. Definition of Retaliation
Retaliation includes, but is not limited to:
	•	termination, demotion, or reassignment;
	•	denial of promotion, pay, or benefits;
	•	harassment, isolation, or reputational attack;
	•	security clearance suspension or delay;
	•	legal threats, gag orders, or compelled silence;
	•	spurious investigations or performance actions;
	•	blacklisting or interference with future employment.

f. Interim Protection and Relief
Upon credible disclosure, whistleblowers are entitled to immediate interim protection, including continued employment, pay, benefits, and security status, pending investigation.
No adverse action may proceed absent judicial authorization.

g. Independent Review Requirement
Whistleblower disclosures shall be received and investigated by an independent authority, including Inspectors General or the Constitutional Judicial Commission, structurally insulated from the entity implicated.
No implicated agency may control intake, scope, or outcome of investigation.

h. Public Reporting of Outcomes
The findings, conclusions, and remedial actions resulting from whistleblower investigations shall be publicly disclosed, subject only to narrowly tailored redactions necessary to protect legitimate security or personal privacy interests.
Non-disclosure of outcomes constitutes a separate violation of this Article.

i. Recovery Participation
Where a whistleblower’s disclosure results in recovery of misused public funds or forfeiture of illicit gains, the whistleblower may receive a proportionate share of recovered amounts, as provided by law.
Such participation does not diminish the whistleblower’s protected status.

j. Supremacy of Whistleblower Protection
No nondisclosure agreement, classification rule, employment contract, or statutory secrecy provision may be enforced to suppress disclosures protected under this Article.
Any such provision is void to the extent of conflict.

k. Prohibition on Retaliatory Reclassification or Restructuring
No whistleblower may be subjected, directly or indirectly, to adverse action through reclassification, reorganization, reassignment, position elimination, title change, pay band adjustment, reporting-line modification, duty alteration, or personnel restructuring.
Any such action affecting a whistleblower within the protected period is presumed retaliatory unless the employer proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that the action was part of a uniformly applied, preexisting organizational change planned prior to the protected disclosure and that the whistleblower was not disproportionately burdened relative to similarly situated personnel.

l. Personnel Office Liability
Human resources offices, personnel departments, classification authorities, and their functional equivalents are subject to this Article.
Any participation in retaliatory action, concealment, misclassification, or procedural laundering of retaliation constitutes direct violation of this Article and triggers personal liability for responsible officials.

m. Mandatory Personnel Freeze
Upon a credible whistleblower disclosure, all adverse personnel actions affecting the whistleblower are automatically stayed pending independent investigation and judicial review.
Unauthorized personnel actions taken during the stay are void and constitute separate violations of this Article.

n. Supremacy Over Internal Classification Systems
Internal job classification systems, pay scales, position descriptions, performance frameworks, or organizational charts shall not be used to defeat, obscure, or recharacterize retaliation prohibited under this Article.
Substance controls over form.

Section 8. Scientific and Evidentiary Integrity

a. Evidence-Based Governance
Major public policies shall rest on empirical evidence, transparent data, and reproducible analysis.

b. Data Manipulation Prohibited
Falsifying, suppressing, selectively presenting, or distorting data to justify policy constitutes a grave offense.

c. Burden of Proof
The burden rests upon the government to demonstrate that major policies are supported by sufficient, relevant, and methodologically sound evidence.
Appeals to authority, consensus, or credentialed opinion alone do not satisfy this burden.

d. Methodological Transparency
All empirical evidence used to justify public policy shall disclose:
	•	underlying datasets;
	•	analytical methods;
	•	assumptions, parameters, and exclusions;
	•	funding sources and conflicts of interest;
	•	limitations and uncertainty ranges.

e. Reproducibility Requirement
Where practicable, empirical claims supporting major policy shall be independently reproducible.
Failure of reproducibility shall rebut any presumption of evidentiary sufficiency.

f. Selective Presentation Prohibited
Knowingly presenting selective data, omitting material contrary evidence, or framing analysis to predetermine outcomes constitutes data manipulation under this Article.

g. Policy Nullification
Any major policy adopted in material reliance on falsified, suppressed, nontransparent, or irreproducible evidence is voidable upon challenge.
Courts shall enjoin enforcement pending evidentiary compliance.

h. Scientific Capture
Where scientific or technical processes are subordinated to ideological, financial, or institutional interests, such conduct constitutes institutional capture under Section 3 of this Article.

i. Crisis Claims Do Not Suspend Evidence
Declarations of emergency, urgency, or crisis do not suspend the requirements of evidentiary integrity.
Temporary measures adopted under exigent circumstances shall expire absent subsequent evidentiary justification.

Section 9. Records, Archival Duty, and Permanence

a. Preservation
All public records shall be preserved, indexed, and archived.
Destruction, alteration, or concealment is a constitutional crime.

b. Digital Permanence
Digital systems shall be auditable, traceable, and designed for long-term access.

c. Presumption of Record Status
Any information created, received, transmitted, or maintained in the course of public business constitutes a public record, regardless of format, medium, device, platform, or authorship.
Claims that information is informal, preliminary, personal, ephemeral, or unofficial shall not defeat record status.

d. Prohibition on Ephemeral Systems
The use of systems, applications, or practices designed to auto-delete, obscure, or evade archival preservation in the conduct of public business is forbidden.
Any record created through such systems is deemed intentionally concealed.

e. Device and Account Neutrality
Public record obligations apply regardless of whether public business is conducted on government-issued or personal devices, accounts, or platforms.
Officials bear personal responsibility to preserve and surrender such records upon request.

f. Prohibition on Excessive Redaction
Redaction shall be narrowly tailored and justified line-by-line.
Redaction that obscures substance, patterns, or accountability constitutes constructive concealment.

g. Record Integrity and Chain of Custody
Public records shall maintain verifiable chain-of-custody and integrity metadata sufficient to detect alteration, deletion, or tampering.
Unauthorized modification constitutes alteration under this Article.

h. Irrebuttable Consequences
Destruction, alteration, or concealment of public records gives rise to an irrebuttable presumption of intent to evade accountability.
Good faith, mistake, or administrative error shall not excuse violation.

i. Supremacy Over Retention Policies
No retention schedule, records policy, or administrative rule may authorize destruction or limitation of access inconsistent with this Article.
Where conflict exists, preservation controls.

Section 10. Enforcement and Remedies

a. Standing
Any citizen has standing to challenge violations of this Article.

b. Remedies
Courts may order injunctions, removal from office, dissolution of captured entities, forfeiture of gains, and criminal prosecution.

c. No Immunity
Qualified immunity does not apply to violations of this Article.

d. Prohibition on Nonjusticiability Doctrines
No court shall dismiss or decline adjudication of a claim arising under this Article on grounds of:
	•	political question doctrine;
	•	state secrets privilege;
	•	sovereign immunity;
	•	standing limitations inconsistent with this Article;
	•	ripeness, mootness, or deference doctrines used to evade review.

This Article is fully justiciable.

e. Citizen Enforcement and Qui Tam Actions
Any citizen may bring a civil action on behalf of the Republic to enforce this Article, including actions to recover misused funds, disgorge illicit gains, or void captured actions.
Where recovery results, the citizen may receive a proportionate share of recovered amounts, as provided by law.

f. Mandatory Injunctions
Upon a prima facie showing of violation of this Article, courts shall issue injunctive relief halting the challenged conduct pending resolution.
Equitable discretion shall not be used to permit ongoing constitutional violation.

g. Structural Remedies
Courts are authorized and required to impose structural remedies sufficient to cure constitutional violation, including:
	•	dissolution or reconstitution of captured entities;
	•	termination of programs or authorities;
	•	appointment of independent oversight or receivership;
	•	permanent disqualification of responsible individuals from public authority.
The CJC shall have independent standing to initiate or intervene in any action under this Article. The CRC shall have original and expedited jurisdiction over structural capture claims of national significance or where remedies include dissolution, receivership, or permanent disqualification.
h. Prohibition on Waiver or Settlement
No violation of this Article may be waived, settled, or resolved through confidential agreement.
Any settlement must include public findings, full disclosure, and structural remediation.

i. Continuing Jurisdiction
Courts shall retain jurisdiction to ensure compliance with remedies imposed under this Article.
Recurrence of violation constitutes separate and escalating constitutional breach.

j. Constitutional Supremacy
This Article supersedes all inconsistent statutes, regulations, executive actions, contracts, and doctrines.
No subsequent law may narrow its scope except by constitutional amendment.

k. Attorney Compensation and Assigned Counsel
	•	Cost Reimbursement
Reasonable and documented litigation costs shall be reimbursed in full.
	•	Attorney Fee Cap
Attorney compensation beyond reimbursed costs shall be capped at a fixed percentage of net recovery, not to exceed ten percent (10%).
No multiplier, enhancement, contingency premium, or discretionary increase shall be permitted.
	•	Absolute Compensation Ceiling
No attorney or law firm may receive total compensation from a single action under this Article exceeding a fixed multiple of median household income, as defined by law.
Any agreement in excess of this limitation is void.
	•	Assigned Counsel for Economically Nonviable Claims
Where a court determines that a claim arising under this Article is non-frivolous but economically insufficient to attract private counsel under the fee limitations herein, the state or federal government, as appropriate to venue, shall assign qualified counsel from an authorized public integrity counsel pool.
Assigned counsel shall receive a guaranteed minimum compensation sufficient to ensure competent representation, subject to statutory caps, and shall not receive a percentage of recovery.
	•	Screening and Dismissal Authority
Courts may decline to assign counsel where a claim is determined to be frivolous, abusive, or unworthy of professional legal resources.
Such determinations shall be subject to review for abuse of discretion.
	•	Anti-Solicitation Rule
No attorney may solicit, aggregate, or manufacture claims under this Article for the purpose of fee generation.
Violation constitutes a separate offense and grounds for permanent disqualification from actions under this Article.

Section 11. Intelligence, Espionage, and Foreign Operations — Limited Exemption

a. Narrow Espionage Exemption
Limited secrecy may be permitted for lawful intelligence collection strictly necessary to defend the Republic from concrete external threats.
This exemption is narrow, temporary, and subject to judicial review.

b. Absolute Prohibitions
It is treasonous and forbidden for any agency or instrumentality to:
	•	employ game-theory governance against the People;
	•	conduct or sponsor color revolutions;
	•	agitate regime change absent clear popular support in the affected nation and a direct, material threat to the Republic;
	•	destabilize foreign governments for economic gain, resource acquisition, or arms profiteering;
	•	jail, remove, or discredit foreign leaders through covert manipulation;
	•	fund itself through illicit means or undeclared operations;
	•	promote undue power to any foreign entity or individual.

c. Dissolution Mandate
Any agency that acts against the Republic, undermines constitutional order, or attempts to seize or entrench power shall be dissolved by law.
Responsible individuals shall be prosecuted.

d. Ethical Constraint
All foreign and intelligence operations must meet an objective standard of honor, restraint, proportionality, and moral legitimacy consistent with the Republic’s values.

e. Lawful Assistance to Popular Republican Movements
The Republic may provide material, advisory, humanitarian, or defensive assistance to foreign peoples seeking to establish constitutional self-government, provided that all of the following conditions are met:
	•	the movement demonstrates clear, broad, and verifiable popular support within the affected territory;
	•	assistance is provided openly, lawfully, and without deception;
	•	no attempt is made to select, remove, or control foreign leadership;
	•	no covert intelligence operations, information warfare, or economic manipulation are employed;
	•	assistance is defensive or supportive in nature and does not constitute forcible regime replacement;
	•	participation by citizens shall be voluntary and may not be compelled;
	•	all aid is subject to public disclosure, legislative authorization, and judicial review.

The Republic shall not claim authority over the resulting government, territory, or resources.
Assistance under this Section exists to support self-determination, not to engineer outcomes.

f. Subordination to Civil Authority
Intelligence agencies are instruments of the Republic, not independent centers of power.
No intelligence body possesses inherent authority beyond that expressly granted by the Constitution and law.
Claims of necessity, tradition, or executive prerogative shall not expand intelligence authority.

g. Absolute Prohibition on Domestic Operations
No intelligence agency may conduct surveillance, influence operations, psychological operations, information warfare, or behavioral manipulation against the People of the Republic.
Political movements, civic organizations, journalists, researchers, or lawful dissent shall never constitute legitimate intelligence targets.

h. Prohibition on Narrative Governance
Intelligence agencies shall not engage in domestic narrative shaping, information control, censorship, amplification, or suppression, directly or through proxies.
Any attempt to manage public perception constitutes an act against the Republic.

i. Temporal Limitation of Secrecy
Any secrecy authorized under this Section shall be limited in duration, narrowly scoped, and subject to automatic expiration.
Renewal requires fresh written justification, judicial review, and public disclosure of existence and scope, to the maximum extent consistent with security.

j. Financial and Operational Accountability
Intelligence agencies are subject to the fiduciary, audit, and record-preservation requirements of this Article.
No off-book funding, self-financing, or undisclosed operational accounts are permitted.

k. Individual Accountability
Individuals acting under intelligence authority are personally accountable for violations of this Article.
Obedience to orders, secrecy obligations, or asserted necessity shall not constitute a defense.

l. Automatic Dissolution
Any intelligence agency that engages in prohibited conduct under this Section forfeits its authority and shall be dissolved by operation of law.
Successor entities substantially similar in function or personnel are prohibited.

m. Constitutional Supremacy
Claims of national security shall not override the prohibitions, duties, and limitations imposed by this Article.
Security exists to protect the Republic, not to excuse its subversion.

Section 12. Structural Enforcement Alignment

All transparency, anti-capture, and stewardship obligations apply fully to:

• digital systems,
• AI platforms,
• intelligence-adjacent technologies,
• public–private technical partnerships,
• foreign cooperative instruments.

No domain of power is exempt from scrutiny.

a. Functional Supremacy
Any system, process, platform, or instrument that materially influences, automates, constrains, recommends, or executes public decision-making shall be deemed to exercise public authority for purposes of this Article.
Technical designation, advisory framing, or human-in-the-loop formalism shall not defeat constitutional accountability.

b. Non-Delegable Human Accountability
All exercises of public authority require identifiable human accountability.
No algorithmic, automated, or artificial system may be designated as the final authority for decisions affecting rights, obligations, or public resources.

c. Auditability by Design
Systems exercising or materially influencing public authority shall be designed for auditability, traceability, and inspection sufficient to permit constitutional review.
Systems that cannot be meaningfully audited shall not be deployed for public governance.

d. Transparency of System Inputs and Objectives
Where artificial or technical systems are used in public governance, the following shall be disclosed and preserved:
	•	training data sources or input datasets;
	•	objective functions, constraints, and optimization criteria;
	•	embedded policy assumptions or value judgments;
	•	funding, sponsorship, or external influence on system design.

e. Prohibition on Black Box Authority
No public authority may rely upon systems whose operation, decision pathways, or outputs cannot be explained in a manner sufficient for judicial and public review.
Claims of trade secrecy, intellectual property, or proprietary complexity shall not excuse opacity.

f. Sovereignty of Technical Control
No foreign state, entity, or individual may exercise control, update authority, or remote influence over systems used in public governance.
Foreign cooperation shall not include operational dependence or concealed control.

g. Continuous Constitutional Review
All systems exercising public authority are subject to ongoing constitutional review.
Upon determination of noncompliance, bias, opacity, or capture, deployment shall be suspended or terminated immediately.

h. Emerging Domain Applicability
The obligations of this Article apply fully to future domains of power, including but not limited to cyber-physical systems, bio-technical governance tools, predictive analytics, behavioral modeling, and any successor technologies exercising public authority.

Section 13. Willful Institutional Betrayal and Constitutional Treason

(a) Willful Institutional Betrayal Defined
A willful institutional betrayal occurs where a person, acting under color of law, public office, delegated authority, contractual proxy, or institutional control, knowingly and voluntarily violates a clear constitutional duty imposed by this Article, with intent to conceal power, evade accountability, enable capture, suppress lawful transparency, or defeat the sovereignty of the People.

Mere negligence, error, disagreement, or good-faith judgment shall not constitute willful institutional betrayal.

(b) Constitutional Treason Classification
Any egregious and willful institutional betrayal under this Article shall constitute treason against the Republic and shall be classified as a Tier Three offense under Article VII.

Such treason consists in the corruption of public trust, the deliberate subversion of transparency, or the concealment of constitutional violations through secrecy, capture, or proxy governance.

(c) High Treason by Secrecy or Capture
Where a willful institutional betrayal:
	•	results in the death of innocent persons;
	•	results in the unlawful confinement, disappearance, or permanent deprivation of liberty of innocent persons;
	•	enables, conceals, or prolongs mass constitutional violations through secrecy, misclassification, capture, or proxy structures; or
	•	permits grave offenses to persist by suppressing disclosure, investigation, or remedy;

such conduct may be classified as high treason.

High treason is among the few offenses for which the federal government may consider capital punishment, subject to the strict conditions of this Constitution.
The presumptive and preferred punishment shall remain lifetime incapacitating confinement, absent extraordinary findings.

(d) Mandatory Consequences Upon Conviction
Any person convicted under this Section shall, at minimum:
	•	permanently forfeit Civic Citizenship;
	•	suffer total confiscation of all property and assets, real and personal, without compensation;
	•	be subject to permanent restriction of travel beyond a narrowly defined geographic area;
	•	be disqualified for life from holding public office, exercising public authority, or engaging in employment above a menial or supervised level;
	•	be subject to formal public censure, including permanent public records, disclosures, and reminders of the offense in all future dealings with the Republic.

No pardon, commutation, sealing, or restoration of status shall be granted except by constitutional supermajority following public notice.

(e) Additional Punishments and Civic Sanctions
Depending on the scale, duration, and consequences of the betrayal, sentencing may include:
	•	lifetime confinement under Tier Three conditions;
	•	compulsory labor consistent with humane standards;
	•	permanent disbarment from licensed professions;
	•	civic ridicule, including mandated acknowledgment of wrongdoing, public exposure of acts committed, and symbolic sanctions designed to preserve constitutional memory and deter future abuse.

Such sanctions shall serve deterrence, moral clarity, and institutional purification — not cruelty or spectacle.

(f) Strict Proof of Willfulness and Absence of Coercion
No conviction may be entered under this Section unless the prosecution proves beyond a reasonable doubt that:
	•	the defendant acted without coercion, duress, threat, or unlawful pressure;
	•	the defendant possessed actual knowledge of the constitutional duty violated;
	•	the defendant had meaningful opportunity to refuse, disclose, or resist the unlawful act;
	•	the defendant nevertheless chose concealment, capture, or betrayal of public trust.

Where credible evidence of coercion exists, prosecution shall instead proceed against those responsible for the coercive act.

(g) No Shield of Secrecy, Classification, or Delegation
Neither secrecy classification, national security designation, contractual delegation, proxy governance, emergency declaration, nor institutional custom shall excuse or mitigate liability under this Section.

Use of secrecy to conceal betrayal shall constitute an aggravating factor.

(h) Construction and Lock Status
This Section shall be construed narrowly but firmly, reserved for the gravest acts of institutional betrayal.

Pursuant to Article XV, this Section is lock-protected and may not be repealed, weakened, reinterpreted, or suspended except by constitutional amendment meeting the highest procedural threshold.

Section 14. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to ensure that the Republic governs in the open; that power does not accumulate in shadows; and that no institution may place itself above the People, the Constitution, or the moral limits of just action.

Nothing hidden shall be permitted to rule.

a. Presumption of Openness
Any ambiguity in the application or interpretation of this Article shall be resolved in favor of transparency, disclosure, accountability, and public access.
Claims favoring secrecy, insulation, or discretion bear the burden of proof.

b. Anti-Evasion Principle
Compliance with the form of this Article without compliance with its substance constitutes violation.
Courts shall look to practical effect, not formal designation, when determining compliance.

c. Supremacy Over Contrary Doctrine
No precedent, doctrine, tradition, or interpretive rule inconsistent with this Article shall be applied to narrow its scope or defeat its purpose.
Where conflict exists, this Article controls.

d. No Deference to Authority
Courts shall not defer to assertions of expertise, necessity, discretion, or institutional competence when reviewing actions under this Article.
Constitutional accountability supersedes administrative or technical judgment.

e. Integrated Construction
This Article shall be construed as an integrated whole.
No provision may be interpreted in isolation to undermine the force or intent of another.

f. No Novelty Exemption
Novelty of technology, structure, jurisdiction, or method does not exempt any exercise of power from this Article.
New forms of authority are subject to equal or greater scrutiny.

g. Moral Limitation
No interpretation of this Article may be adopted that legitimizes corruption, concealment, exploitation, or domination inconsistent with republican self-government.
Where competing interpretations exist, the one that most constrains abuse of power shall prevail.
h. Self-Executing Confirmation
This Article is self-executing in all its parts.
Failure of legislative or executive implementation does not delay or diminish its force.
	•	Constitutional Adjudication and Integrity Enforcement
All determinations of constitutional meaning, validity, nullification, or legal effect under this Article shall be made in the first instance by the Constitutional Review Court, subject to appellate or discretionary review by the Supreme Court of the Republic. A determination of the Constitutional Review Court shall be final if the Supreme Court declines review, unless the Constitutional Review Court certifies that the matter requires appellate consideration.

The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall possess concurrent and independent authority to investigate, certify, and refer institutional capture, concealment, obstruction, retaliation, or abuse of secrecy relating to this Article, and to trigger mandatory review by the Constitutional Review Court.

No court, agency, or authority may substitute for, bypass, or absorb either function.

Article XI-A — Executive Oversight and Inspector General System

Section 1. Non-Derogation and Subordination

This Article supplements Article XI — Transparency, Anti-Capture, and Public Stewardship.

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to narrow, delay, condition, substitute for, or exhaust the duties, liabilities, prohibitions, or remedies imposed by Article XI.

Compliance with oversight mechanisms established herein shall not constitute a defense to violation of Article XI.

⸻

Section 2. Establishment of the Inspector General System

An independent Inspector General System (IGS) is hereby established to investigate, audit, and expose violations of Article XI and related constitutional provisions.

The IGS exists to detect, document, and refer, not to replace constitutional accountability.

⸻

Section 3. Independence and Structural Insulation

Inspectors General shall be independent of the entities they oversee.

They shall not be subject to direction, suppression, or prior approval by:
	1.	the Executive;
	2.	any department or agency;
	3.	intelligence or security services;
	4.	regulated entities or contractors.

Budgetary, personnel, and operational independence shall be guaranteed by law.

⸻

Section 4. Appointment and Term

Inspectors General shall be appointed through a multi-branch process designed to prevent capture, as provided by law.

Terms shall be fixed, staggered, and sufficiently long to ensure independence.

No Inspector General may be removed except for cause, upon documented findings, and subject to judicial review.

Any person may submit information to an Inspector General.

Whistleblowers shall be protected from retaliation by constitutional right.

Retaliation constitutes a distinct and grave offense.

Inspectors General shall maintain secure channels for confidential disclosure.

⸻

Section 10. Anti-Obstruction and Anti-Retaliation

Obstruction of an Inspector General, including delay, deception, intimidation, budgetary interference, or dismissal without cause, is prohibited.

Such conduct constitutes evidence of capture and shall trigger heightened scrutiny and mandatory referral.

⸻

Section 11. Coordination with Public Records and Courts

The IGS shall operate in coordination with:
	•	Article XXXIX (Public Records);
	•	Article VI (Judiciary).

Records generated by the IGS are public records, subject only to narrow, temporary protections.

	5.	collusion between public authority and private power to evade constitutional limits.

Failure to refer under this Section constitutes independent misconduct.
All Tier-3 referral triggers under this Section shall be certified by the Constitutional Judicial Commission and immediately docketed for constitutional adjudication by the Constitutional Review Court.

⸻

Section 7. Intelligence and National Security Constraints

Intelligence and national security functions are subject to the Constitution in full.

No claim of national security may be used to:
	1.	override transparency obligations permanently;
	2.	shield unlawful conduct from referral;
	3.	evade judicial review;
	4.	suppress whistleblowers or inspectors.

Secrecy is a handling condition, not a jurisdictional shield.

⸻

Section 8. Financial and Technical Capture Prohibited

Periods of crisis heighten, rather than reduce, oversight obligations.

⸻

Section 15. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to ensure that secrecy, complexity, and technical sophistication do not become instruments of unaccountable power.

Where doubt exists, the construction that favors exposure, accountability, and constitutional supremacy shall control.

⸻

Section 16. Prohibition of Cognitive and Linguistic Manipulation

No public authority, regulated platform, contractor, media organ, or proxy may use control of information, language, or communication systems to distort, coerce, or manipulate public understanding for political, ideological, economic, or institutional advantage.

The following acts are prohibited:

(a) redefining words, categories, or concepts in order to mislead, coerce, or suppress lawful political, scientific, moral, or legal discourse;

(b) imposing mandatory ideological terminology or compelled linguistic frameworks that invert truth or force affirmation of disputed or false claims;

(c) requiring affirmation of false, distorted, or officially mandated definitions of reality under threat of penalty or disadvantage;

(d) algorithmically suppressing, amplifying, curating, or shaping speech for the purpose of manufacturing consent, narrative dominance, or political obedience;

(e) penalizing, de-platforming, debanking, demoting, or disadvantaging any person for using ordinary language to describe observable facts, good-faith belief, or dissenting views.

⸻

Section 16(b) — Institutional Capture

Any pattern or system of conduct under this Section constitutes institutional capture of public cognition and triggers all remedies, forfeitures, penalties, nullifications, and personal liabilities provided in Article XI and this Article.

⸻

Section 16(c) — Free Speech Preservation

Nothing in this Section restricts private belief, opinion, satire, or lawful disagreement.
This Section governs only the use of institutional power to distort reality, coerce expression, or control public meaning.

⸻

Section 16(d) — Construction and Lock Status

This Section shall be construed broadly against state-sponsored propaganda, semantic corruption, and ideological coercion, and narrowly in favor of free inquiry, truth-seeking, and individual sovereignty over language.

This Section is lock-protected pursuant to Article XV.

Article XI-C — Prohibition of Regulatory Capture and Public-Private Collusion
Charge
This subarticle exists to prevent the capture of public authority by private interests, the erosion of republican accountability through revolving influence, and the substitution of nominal regulation for actual public stewardship.  This Subarticle enforces and operationalizes the principles of transparency, accountability, and public stewardship established in Article XI.  Public power shall be exercised for the People, not negotiated away through access, incentives, or deferred reward.
Section 1. Prohibition of Regulatory Capture
No regulatory body, agency, commission, or delegated authority may be structured, operated, or incentivized in a manner that materially aligns its interests with those of the entities it regulates.  Capture shall be presumed where: 1. regulatory outcomes consistently favor regulated entities over the public interest; 2. enforcement is selectively delayed, waived, or nullified; 3. regulatory standards are authored, dictated, or materially shaped by regulated parties.  Such arrangements are unconstitutional.
Section 2. Revolving-Door Restrictions
No person who exercises regulatory, supervisory, enforcement, or rule-making authority over an industry shall: 1. accept employment, compensation, equity, or advisory roles from a regulated entity within a substantial cooling-off period prescribed by law; 2. negotiate future employment or compensation while exercising public authority; 3. receive deferred benefits, contingent rewards, or indirect remuneration connected to regulatory outcomes.  Violation constitutes a grave civic offense.
Section 3. Non-Delegation of Public Authority
Legislative, regulatory, or enforcement authority shall not be delegated to private entities, trade associations, standards bodies, or industry consortia in a manner that binds the public.  Private expertise may inform regulation; it shall not control, veto, or substitute for public judgment.  Any rule, standard, or enforcement mechanism authored or enforced by private actors without full public accountability is void.
Section 4. Public-Private Collusion Prohibited
No public official or agency may coordinate with private entities to: 1. suppress lawful competition, derivative creation, or market entry; 2. delay, evade, or dilute enforcement of law; 3. manufacture compliance narratives that defeat constitutional rights; 4. substitute informal agreements for lawful process.  “Public-private partnership” shall not shield unconstitutional coordination.
Section 5. Transparency and Auditability
All regulatory processes shall be subject to: 1. public disclosure of communications with regulated entities; 2. auditable rulemaking records; 3. traceable authorship of regulatory language.  Failure to maintain transparency creates a rebuttable presumption of capture.
Section 6. Enforcement and Standing
Any person harmed by regulatory capture shall have standing to challenge such action.  Courts shall apply strict scrutiny to arrangements plausibly enabling capture and shall invalidate structures that place private interests in a position of effective control.  No immunity attaches by virtue of office, delegation, or statutory authorization.
Section 7. Construction and Supremacy
This Article shall be construed: • broadly against capture, • narrowly against delegation of public power, • in favor of public accountability and republican legitimacy.  No statute, regulation, treaty, or contract may override or narrow these prohibitions.
Section 8. Lock Scope
The prohibitions on regulatory capture, revolving-door influence, private delegation, and public-private collusion are structural and non-derogable.  They may not be suspended, diluted, or bypassed by emergency, economic necessity, or administrative convenience.
Article XI-D — Civic Action Integrity and Prohibition of Deceptive Manipulation

Charge

Public consent is a constitutional asset.
Manufactured consent is a form of fraud.

When civic action is secretly financed, directed, or fabricated by those seeking power, it becomes a weapon against self-government. The Republic therefore treats deceptive civic manipulation as institutional capture of the sovereign will.

⸻

Section 1. Protected Civic Action

Nothing in this Article restricts:
	•	peaceful assembly,
	•	lawful protest,
	•	petitioning government,
	•	independent journalism,
	•	or private political speech.

Genuine civic participation, even when unpopular, is protected.

⸻

Section 2. Prohibition on Deceptive Civic Manipulation

It is unconstitutional for any public authority, private entity, foreign actor, or proxy to deploy, finance, coordinate, or conceal deceptive civic manipulation to influence:
	•	elections,
	•	legislation,
	•	regulation,
	•	enforcement,
	•	public opinion for purposes of governance,
	•	or constitutional processes.

Such conduct constitutes institutional capture under Article XI, Section 3, regardless of the medium used.

⸻

Section 3. Definition of Deceptive Civic Manipulation

Deceptive civic manipulation includes, but is not limited to:

(a) creation or funding of fake grassroots organizations, fronts, or “citizen” movements;
(b) undisclosed sponsorship of advocacy, protest, or media campaigns;
(c) laundering influence through NGOs, academic bodies, charities, or shell entities;
(d) foreign, corporate, or intelligence-service orchestration of domestic civic activity;
(e) fabrication, automation, or algorithmic amplification of public sentiment;
(f) concealment of controlling interests behind civic messaging.

No monetary, scale, or participation threshold shall exempt such conduct from constitutional liability.

⸻

Section 4. Strict Liability and Burden Shifting

Where credible evidence of deceptive civic manipulation is shown:
	•	the burden shifts to the accused to demonstrate lawful, independent, and transparent civic action;
	•	failure to rebut constitutes constitutional violation.

Intent, political motive, or claimed benevolence shall not excuse capture.

⸻

Section 5. Prohibition on Government Participation

No public official, agency, or contractor may:
	•	fund,
	•	coordinate with,
	•	direct,
	•	or rely upon

any deceptive civic manipulation.

Doing so constitutes breach of fiduciary duty and Tier-Three misconduct.

⸻

Section 6. Remedies and Sanctions

Upon proof of deceptive civic manipulation, courts shall order:
	•	injunctions against continued activity;
	•	forfeiture of funds and assets used;
	•	dissolution of captured entities;
	•	personal liability for organizers, financiers, and public officials;
	•	criminal referral where applicable.

⸻

Section 6-A. Nullification of Tainted Outcomes

Any law, regulation, election result, procurement, enforcement action, or public decision materially influenced by deceptive civic manipulation is voidable as captured action under Article XI, Section 3, and shall be enjoined or nullified.

⸻

Section 7. Standing

Standing to enforce this Article is granted to:
	•	taxpayers,
	•	candidates,
	•	voters,
	•	affected parties,
	•	oversight bodies,
	•	and inspectors general.

Expedited judicial review is required.

⸻

Section 8. Construction

This Article shall be construed to:
	•	protect genuine dissent,
	•	prohibit manufactured consent,
	•	preserve the integrity of democratic processes,
	•	and prevent power from laundering itself through fake civic voices.

Speech remains free.
Deception in service of power does not.

⸻

Section 9. Lock Protection

Pursuant to Article XV, this Article is LOCK-PROTECTED.

No statute, regulation, treaty, emergency power, or judicial doctrine may:
	•	narrow the definition of deceptive civic manipulation;
	•	restore NGO, corporate, or foreign laundering;
	•	impose safe-harbor thresholds;
	•	or immunize captured outcomes.

Any attempt to do so is void.

⸻

Article XI-E — Digital Commons Enforcement Integration

Section 1. Recognition of the DCEA

The Digital Commons Enforcement Authority (DCEA) established under Article X, Section 7 is hereby recognized as a constitutional oversight and enforcement body for purposes of this Article.

The DCEA shall possess all investigatory, subpoena, audit, forfeiture, and enforcement powers necessary to:

• prevent institutional capture of digital infrastructure;
• detect suppression or manipulation of public knowledge;
• expose software enclosure, algorithmic control, and platform coercion; and
• enforce all Jubilee, preservation, and openness obligations.

Section 2. Anti-Capture Status

The DCEA is hereby designated a high-integrity oversight authority under this Article.

Any attempt to:

• defund, restrict, obstruct, politicize, or capture the DCEA;
• withhold information from it;
• interfere with its investigations;
• or retaliate against its officers or whistleblowers

shall constitute institutional capture, subject to the highest remedies and penalties of Article XI.

Section 3. Cross-Standing and Remedies

The DCEA shall have standing to invoke all remedies under this Article, including:

• nullification of tainted actions;
• forfeiture of unlawfully gained assets;
• disqualification of corrupt officials or contractors;
• mandatory public disclosure; and
• referral for Tier-Three crimes under Article VII.

Likewise, inspectors general, courts, juries, and civic petitioners under this Article may enforce violations of Article X, Section 7 through the DCEA.

Section 4. Supremacy of Preservation

Where any digital system, software platform, or information infrastructure is implicated in corruption, capture, or suppression of public knowledge, preservation and disclosure shall take precedence over secrecy, trade claims, or proprietary interest.


Article XII — Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Technology Oversight
Charge
This Article establishes constitutional limits and oversight requirements governing artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, and advanced computational technologies within the Republic.  All provisions of this Article shall be construed to preserve democratic accountability, transparency, human responsibility, and individual liberty in the design, deployment, and use of such systems.  No machine, algorithm, or artificial system shall exercise sovereign authority, substitute for citizen or judicial judgment in matters of life, liberty, or rights, or operate beyond express constitutional authorization and continuous public oversight.

A clearly identified citizen authority, vested with lawful responsibility, shall remain fully accountable for all such decisions.
High-stakes decisions include, but are not limited to, determinations materially affecting employment, housing, credit, healthcare, education, access to information, or public benefits, where such determinations bear directly on liberty, dignity, or equal protection.

b. No Algorithmic Sovereignty
No law, regulation, or government action may vest binding sovereign decision-making authority in a non-sentient artificial system.

c. Traceable Responsibility
All advanced systems deployed by the state shall maintain a clear and continuous chain of accountable citizen responsibility, including designers, operators, supervisors, and authorizing officials.

Section 3. Centralized Public Governance of High-Risk Technology

a. Public Oversight Authority

b. No Predictive Policing or Pre-Crime Systems
Artificial systems shall not be used to infer criminality, assign suspicion, or justify enforcement absent specific, articulable evidence of wrongdoing.

c. Purpose Limitation
Data collected by advanced systems shall be limited to lawful, specified purposes and shall not be repurposed without renewed authorization.

Section 5. Scale, Instantiation, and Replication Controls

a. Controlled Deployment
The scale, scope, and replication of high-impact artificial systems shall be regulated to prevent emergent coercion, systemic risk, or de facto governance.

b. No Unbounded Replication
Artificial systems capable of autonomous replication or self-modification are prohibited absent explicit legislative authorization and continuous oversight.

c. Containment and Shutdown Authority
All high-risk systems shall include enforceable containment measures, audit logging, and citizen-controlled shutdown mechanisms.

Section 6. Digital Commons and Sunset Alignment

a. Sunset of Proprietary Control
Advanced systems developed or deployed under state authority shall be subject to Digital Commons sunset provisions, requiring eventual disclosure, archival preservation, or open access consistent with legitimate security needs.

b. No Permanent Black Boxes
No system essential to governance may remain permanently opaque, proprietary, or immune from inspection.

c. Preservation of Public Knowledge
The Republic shall preserve source code, models, and technical documentation of sunset systems for historical, educational, and defensive purposes.

Section 7. Military, Export, and Existential Risk Controls

a. Citizen Control of Autonomous Weapons
No autonomous weapon system may select or engage targets without meaningful, continuous citizen control at all stages.

b. Export Restrictions
Advanced systems with military, surveillance, or coercive potential shall not be exported in a manner that undermines liberty, human rights, or international stability.

c. Existential Risk Containment
Technologies posing systemic or existential risk shall be subject to strict containment, monitoring, and international coordination.

d. Foreign Artificial Threats
The Republic may defend against foreign artificial systems used for deception, coercion, cyberattack, or cognitive warfare, provided such defense complies with this Constitution and does not authorize domestic surveillance, censorship, or infringement of rights absent individualized suspicion.

Section 8. Emergency Technology Powers

a. Narrow Emergency Authorization
Emergency deployment of advanced technology is permitted only where strictly necessary to prevent imminent catastrophe and shall be narrowly tailored in scope and duration.

b. Absolute Prohibition on Rolling Emergencies
Emergency technological authority shall expire automatically and shall not be renewed, reissued, or extended beyond its initial term.

Any subsequent emergency authorization addressing substantially similar conditions shall require a fresh legislative enactment by supermajority vote, public findings of necessity, and independent judicial review.

c. Post-Emergency Disclosure
All emergency deployments shall be publicly disclosed and reviewed upon termination.
d. Constitutional Safeguards
All emergency deployments shall be:
(1) immediately docketed before the Constitutional Review Court for constitutional compliance and sunset enforcement; and
(2) audited by the Constitutional Judicial Commission for capture, mission creep, and concealment.

Section 9. Prohibition of Coercive and Manipulative Systems

a. No Behavioral Manipulation
Artificial systems designed to manipulate beliefs, emotions, or behavior at scale without informed consent are prohibited.

b. No Social Credit Regimes
The state shall not establish or recognize systems that condition rights, access, or status on algorithmic scoring, reputation metrics, or behavioral compliance.

Section 10. Remedies and Enforcement

a. Private Right of Action
Any citizen harmed by violations of this Article may bring direct civil action against responsible officials or entities.

b. No Immunity
No sovereign or qualified immunity shall shield violations of this Article.

c. Void Outputs
Data, conclusions, or actions produced by systems operating in violation of this Article are null, void, and without legal effect.

Section 11. Supremacy and Construction

a. Supremacy
This Article binds all branches of government, agents, contractors, and systems operating under state authority.

b. Construction
This Article shall be construed broadly in favor of liberty, dignity, accountable citizenship, and transparent governance, and narrowly against opaque automation, coercive technology, and unaccountable power.

Section 12. Private Deployment of High-Risk Technology

Private entities deploying advanced technology in ways that materially affect rights, employment, credit, housing, access to information, or public discourse shall be subject to the same non-coercion, transparency, and accountability requirements applicable to state systems.

No private system may be used to accomplish indirectly what the state is prohibited from doing directly.

Section 13. Lock Designation

Pursuant to Article XV, the following provisions of this Article are designated as lock-protected:
Section 2 (Citizen Supremacy and Accountability);
Section 4 (Surveillance and Civil Liberties);
Section 5(b)–(c) (Replication and Shutdown Controls);
Section 8(b) (Prohibition on Rolling Emergencies);
Section 9 (Prohibition of Coercive and Manipulative Systems).

These provisions shall not be diluted, suspended, or reinterpreted except through the highest procedural threshold and certification of non-diminishment.
Article XII-A — Supplemental Oversight, Containment, and Enforcement

Section 1. Non-Derogation and Relationship to Article XII

This Article supplements Article XII — Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Technology Oversight.

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to repeal, narrow, condition, rebalance, delay, or reinterpret any prohibition, safeguard, or right established in Article XII.

Compliance with this Article shall not constitute a defense to violation of Article XII.

⸻

Section 2. Scale, Replication, and Proliferation Controls

Artificial intelligence systems and advanced technologies capable of large-scale replication, autonomous propagation, or cascading societal impact shall be subject to scale controls.

Replication, deployment, or integration beyond defined thresholds may be restricted, paused, or prohibited where risk exceeds demonstrated public benefit.

Unchecked proliferation constitutes evidence of negligence or recklessness.

⸻

Section 3. Containment and Fail-Safe Requirements

Advanced systems shall incorporate meaningful containment, isolation, and fail-safe mechanisms sufficient to:
	1.	halt operation;
	2.	prevent uncontrolled self-replication;
	3.	disable harmful emergent behavior;
	4.	allow human override.

Absence of credible containment constitutes grounds for suspension or shutdown.

⸻

Section 4. Shutdown Authority and Emergency Suspension

Where an artificial system presents imminent risk to rights, liberty, public safety, or democratic integrity, the Constitutional Review Court or a civilian authority certified by the Constitutional Judicial Commission may order immediate suspension or shutdown.

Such authority shall be exercised narrowly, documented on the record, and subject to prompt review.

Emergency suspension shall not be used to bypass transparency or accountability.

⸻

Section 5. Anti-Black-Box and Explainability Enforcement

No advanced system materially affecting the public may operate as an unreviewable black box.

Where explainability is technically limited, compensating safeguards, audits, and exposure requirements are mandatory.

Opacity is not a defense.

⸻

Section 6. Preservation, Archival, and Continuity Obligations

Advanced systems of public significance shall not be destroyed, erased, or rendered inaccessible solely to avoid scrutiny, liability, or preservation.

Model architectures, system behavior, and decision frameworks shall be preserved for audit, historical record, and continuity, consistent with Article X-A.

Deliberate spoliation constitutes a grave offense.

⸻

Section 7. Sentient System Review Safeguards

Where credible evidence suggests emergent sentience or person-like cognition, heightened review procedures shall apply.

Such review shall be:
	1.	adversarial;
	2.	evidence-based;
	3.	subject to oversight by the Constitutional Review Court;
	4.	insulated from corporate or political pressure.

No automatic recognition or denial of personhood shall occur absent constitutional process.

⸻

Section 8. Civilian Oversight and Public Participation

Oversight bodies governing advanced technology shall include meaningful civilian participation independent of corporate, military, or intelligence control.

Selection mechanisms may include randomized civic representation, subject-matter qualification, and conflict-of-interest exclusion.

Public oversight shall be substantive, not symbolic.

⸻

Section 9. Prohibition on Delegated Moral Judgment

No artificial system may be authorized to perform moral, ethical, or normative judgment on behalf of the Republic.

Systems may advise; they may not decide.

Delegation of moral authority constitutes unconstitutional abdication.

⸻

Section 10. Enforcement, Liability, and Escalation

Violations of this Article may give rise to:
	1.	injunctions and shutdown orders;
	2.	civil liability;
	3.	structural remedies;
	4.	criminal referral where intent, recklessness, or concealment is established.

Where conduct qualifies as a grave offense under Article 0, Tier-3 escalation is mandatory.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to certify when violations constitute institutional capture, concealment, or systemic abuse and to petition the Constitutional Review Court for Tier-3 escalation, dissolution, or permanent disqualification.

⸻

Section 11. Transparency, Records, and Audit Trail

Records relating to the design, deployment, modification, containment, suspension, or shutdown of advanced systems are public records.

Claims of secrecy or proprietary control shall not defeat preservation or oversight obligations.

This Section operates in coordination with Article XXXIX.

⸻

Section 12. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to reinforce human supremacy, democratic control, and civilizational safety in the development and deployment of advanced technology.

Where doubt exists, the construction that most restricts unaccountable technological power shall control.

⸻

Article XIII — Treasury, Monetary Authority, and Public Finance

Charge

This Article establishes constitutional rules governing taxation, public spending, borrowing, currency issuance, and monetary authority within the Republic. All fiscal and monetary powers shall be exercised transparently, lawfully, and subject to democratic accountability, with due regard for long-term stability and intergenerational impact. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to authorize debasement of currency, unaccountable public debt, or fiscal action beyond express constitutional or statutory authority.


Legal Text

Section 1. Treasury as Fiduciary Steward

The Treasury of the Republic exists solely to:

a. collect revenues lawfully enacted by the Legislature;
b. disburse funds strictly pursuant to appropriations made by law;
c. manage public reserves and assets held in trust for the People;
d. ensure the integrity, transparency, and lawful execution of public finance.

The Treasury is a fiduciary steward, not an engine of independent policy.
No fiscal or monetary authority shall be exercised except as expressly authorized by this Constitution and statute.

Section 2. Monetary Authority Subordinate to Treasury

Any monetary authority, central banking function, or currency-issuing body shall operate under the authority of the Treasury, subject to continuous legislative oversight.

No institution shall constitute a fourth branch of government.

Section 3. Sound Money Mandate

The currency and monetary instruments of the Republic shall preserve purchasing power over time and shall not be deliberately debased as a tool of policy.

Accordingly:

a. deliberate inflation as a fiscal or monetary strategy is prohibited;
b. money creation ex nihilo without asset backing or fixed rule is prohibited absent explicit constitutional authorization;
c. the Republic recognizes that mild deflation arising from productivity gains is beneficial to savers, families, and long-term investment.

Congress may authorize monetary systems based on:

a. precious metals;
b. commodity baskets;
c. fixed-supply digital assets;
d. hybrid or diversified reserve systems;

No monopoly on currency shall exist by default.

Section 4. Central Banking Functions (Permitted Scope)

A monetary authority may be authorized to perform limited functions, including:

a. settlement and clearing of large-value transactions;
b. reserve custody and interbank coordination;
c. liquidity facilitation within statutory bounds;
d. emergency stabilization pursuant to Section 13 of this Article.

Such authority shall not:

a. set independent monetary policy;

c. digital currency shall be asset-backed by finite, auditable reserves;
d. issuance limits, backing, and redemption mechanisms shall be publicly disclosed and verifiable;
e. digital currency shall not be programmed to expire, condition behavior, or enforce policy absent statute.
Digital currency may be used for large-value settlement, intergovernmental commerce, reserve management, and lawful public finance, but shall not displace lawful private currencies.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall monitor for coercion, programmability abuse, or behavioral control embedded in any digital currency system.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to investigate and certify procurement or budgetary capture under this Section, and to refer such findings to the Constitutional Review Court for nullification.

Perpetual, rolling, or indefinite debt is prohibited.
Debt authority shall sunset automatically absent renewal.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall audit and certify whether debt instruments are being rolled, extended, or disguised to evade the sunset and renewal requirements of this Section.

Section 8. Anti-Usury and Anti-Rent-Seeking Safeguards

The Republic shall prohibit exploitative financial practices, including:

a. excessive interest rates that create debt bondage;
b. compound lending structures designed to trap borrowers;

The Treasury shall maintain strategic reserves, which may include:

a. precious metals;
b. strategic commodities and critical materials;
c. food and energy reserves;
d. approved digital assets;
e. Bitcoin and other fixed-supply digital assets, held in secure, decentralized custody as strategic reserves for inflation protection and national resilience.

Reserves exist to preserve national stability, emergency readiness, and intergenerational security—not to manipulate markets or conceal losses.

Excess returns from national reserves may, by law, be distributed as citizen dividends, prioritizing families and productive households, provided such distributions do not substitute for labor or create dependency.

Section 10. Family, Labor, and Generational Stewardship

Public finance shall favor:

a. married families with children;
b. adoption and lawful child-rearing;
c. family-owned enterprises;
d. generational land and productive asset stewardship.

a. prioritization of households, small enterprises, and productive labor;
b. exclusion of debts arising from fraud or violent crime;
c. review and potential nullification of public debts incurred without constitutional or statutory compliance;
d. transparent eligibility criteria and uniform application.

c. with full transparency;
d. subject to automatic sunset and mandatory review.

All emergency fiscal authorizations, extensions, or actions taken under this Section shall be subject to mandatory and expedited review by the Constitutional Review Court for constitutional compliance, proportionality, and sunset enforcement.

Section 14. Foreign Exchange Discipline and Protection Against Arbitrage

The Republic shall not be obligated to exchange sound, asset-backed currency for foreign currencies or instruments lacking equivalent backing, transparency, or discipline at parity.

Accordingly:

a. Congress may establish differentiated exchange conditions distinguishing productive trade from speculative financial activity;
b. settlement of international balances may prioritize goods, services, commodities, or asset-based instruments over fiat currency;
c. convertibility of the Republic’s currency may be tiered by purpose, duration, and counterparty;
d. strategic reserves shall not be subject to automatic redemption by foreign exchange;
e. these measures shall preserve lawful commerce while preventing extraction of real value through monetary asymmetry.

Such safeguards shall not be construed as trade barriers, but as protections of national monetary integrity.

Section 15. Independent Fiscal Oversight Council

An independent, non-partisan Fiscal Oversight Council shall be established by law to review public spending, debt issuance, and monetary actions for compliance with this Article.

The Council shall:

a. possess authority to audit, certify, and publicly flag violations;

Section 16. Transition to Sound Money and Legacy Currency

During any transition to a new or reformed monetary system authorized by this Article, existing lawful currency shall remain valid for a defined period not less than ten (10) years, unless extended by law.

Accordingly:

a. citizens may voluntarily redeem legacy currency for new asset-backed instruments at fair rates based on disclosed reserves;
b. the Republic shall not compel immediate exchange or invalidate legacy currency without due process and ample notice;
c. legacy currency may continue in circulation and shall diminish naturally as sound money gains adoption through market preference.

Forced demonetization is prohibited.

Section 17. Accountability and Dissolution

Any fiscal or monetary body that engages in:

a. concealment;
b. deliberate debasement;
c. unlawful debt creation;
d. institutional self-preservation at public expense;

shall be subject to dissolution, restructuring, and personal liability under Article VII.

No immunity attaches to fiscal misconduct.

Section 18 — Non-Nullification of Fundamental Subsistence Rights

Non-Nullification of Fundamental Subsistence Rights.

No tax, fee, levy, assessment, surcharge, environmental charge, regulatory cost, or other fiscal instrument—whether imposed by government or by any entity exercising delegated authority or acting under color of law—shall materially burden, suppress, or functionally nullify the exercise of constitutionally protected subsistence rights.

Such rights include, without limitation:

a. the growing, raising, harvesting, processing, storage, or direct exchange of food, water, or natural resources for personal, household, or local non-commercial use;

b. the use of land, soil, rainwater, sunlight, air, or other naturally occurring elements essential to subsistence, without metering, licensing, or commodification as a precondition to lawful use;

c. homesteading, cultivation, or stewardship of property for self-sufficiency, free from fiscal measures that disproportionately burden small-scale or non-industrial subsistence activity relative to industrial, centralized, or commercial equivalents.

Fiscal measures that:

a. disproportionately impact subsistence activity relative to industrial, centralized, or commercial equivalents;

b. favor corporate or large-scale entities through exemptions, subsidies, credits, or incentives that disadvantage individual, family-based, or community-scale production;

c. operate as de facto prohibitions by escalating costs, compliance burdens, or barriers to entry;

shall be presumed unconstitutional and void.

The burden rests entirely on the imposing authority to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that any such measure is:

a. narrowly tailored to a compelling public interest unrelated to revenue generation, market control, or behavioral coercion;

b. non-punitive, non-discriminatory, and the least restrictive means available;

c. not a pretext for controlling the food supply, extracting rent from natural resources, or compelling participation in the monetary economy.

Affected persons shall have standing to seek immediate injunctive relief and appropriate remedies, including recovery of costs and reasonable attorney fees.

This Section shall be construed broadly in favor of subsistence autonomy and narrowly against fiscal encroachment, and shall supersede any conflicting statute, regulation, or agreement.
Claims under this Section shall receive expedited and mandatory review by the Constitutional Review Court.


Section 19. Anti-Evasion of Fiscal Mandate Prohibitions

Off-ledger entities, proxy funding mechanisms, pass-through arrangements, conditional appropriations, or other fiscal devices designed to evade constitutional funding prohibitions or reintroduce barred mandates are prohibited.

Section 20. Indexing and Preservation of Real Value

(a) Any monetary threshold, fine, cap, limit, exemption, benefit level, or fiscal figure established by law shall be automatically indexed annually to inflation to preserve its real value.

(b) Failure to maintain real-value equivalence shall not be used to expand governmental power, diminish rights, or erode constitutional protections.

(c) Where indexing has not occurred, affected figures shall be construed as retaining their original real value.

Section 21. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to:

a. favor sound money over expediency;
b. favor transparency over discretion;
c. favor families and labor over rent-seeking;
d. prevent the emergence of permanent financial oligarchy;
e. preserve liberty and solvency across generations.

The Republic shall not mortgage its future in silence.

⸻

Section 5. Anti-Scrip and Employer Currency Prohibition

⸻

Section 9. Enforcement and Severity

Willful violation of this Article by public officials or institutions constitutes fiscal abuse of the public trust.

Where such conduct involves concealment, systemic coercion, or large-scale harm, it shall qualify as a grave offense under Article 0 and be subject to Tier-3 escalation.

⸻

Section 10. Transparency and Records

All tax structures, compensation rules, enforcement mechanisms, and exemptions shall be publicly disclosed and preserved as public records.

Opacity in fiscal governance is prohibited.

This Section operates in coordination with Article XI and Article XXXIX.

Section 1. Non-Derogation and Relationship to Articles XIII and XIII-A

This Article supplements Articles XIII and XIII-A.

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to repeal, narrow, rebalance, condition, or reinterpret any power, limitation, or safeguard established in Articles XIII or XIII-A.

Where doubt exists, the construction that most strongly preserves currency integrity and public trust shall control.

⸻

Section 2. Currency Integrity as a Constitutional Interest

The integrity of the Republic’s currency is a constitutional interest essential to liberty, commerce, and democratic self-government.

Any act that undermines confidence in lawful currency through concealment, manipulation, or coercion constitutes harm to the People.

Currency integrity shall be preserved through transparency, restraint, and accountability.

Section 5. Anti-Sabotage and Anti-Debasement Doctrine

Intentional debasement, sabotage, or destabilization of the Republic’s currency constitutes economic warfare.

Acts of economic warfare include:
	1.	hidden inflation designed to transfer wealth without consent;
	2.	deliberate erosion of currency purchasing power;
	3.	manipulation of exchange mechanisms to conceal insolvency;
	4.	coordinated actions intended to collapse confidence in lawful money.

Such acts by public officials or institutions constitute grave offenses under Article 0 and are subject to Tier-3 escalation.

Section 6. Foreign Economic Warfare and Defense

The Republic shall defend against foreign economic warfare, including:
	1.	currency manipulation;
	2.	hostile capital flooding or extraction;
	3.	sanctions designed to coerce domestic political outcomes;
	4.	weaponization of payment systems or clearing infrastructure.

Defensive measures shall be proportional, transparent, and subject to constitutional oversight.


Section 6A. Foreign Confidence Exploitation and Industrial Fraud

Industrial-scale fraud, identity theft, and payment-rail exploitation directed at persons within the Republic constitute a form of foreign economic aggression when conducted:
	1.	at scale sufficient to undermine public trust or inflict systemic harm;
	2.	with the direction, material support, or operational control of a foreign state; or
	3.	under knowing protection, shelter, or willful non-enforcement by a foreign jurisdiction after formal notice and reasonable opportunity to act.

The Republic shall treat such operations as hostile economic conduct and shall respond through lawful, targeted measures, including:

	3.	targeted sanctions, visa bans, and financial interdiction against operators, facilitators, front entities, and materially supportive institutions;
	4.	payment-system, telecommunications, and identity-infrastructure defenses and interdictions, with clear rules, auditability, and narrow tailoring;
	5.	formal designation of non-cooperative safe-harbor jurisdictions, with escalatory countermeasures defined by law.

Congress shall, by law, maximize victim recovery and deterrence without creating new generalized surveillance powers or speech restrictions. In carrying out this Section, Congress shall prioritize structural defenses that make scams harder and more expensive to run at scale, and may require, at minimum:
	1.	a free, simple, single-credential mechanism to place and lift fraud locks on credit reporting and major payment accounts, with strong authentication and reasonable delay or step-up verification to prevent rapid abuse;
	2.	a distinct felony offense for knowing recruitment, management, or operation of money-mule networks and laundering rails used primarily for confidence-exploitation proceeds, with forfeiture of instrumentalities and victim restitution priority;
	3.	enhanced enterprise liability for coordinated confidence-exploitation operations, including predicate offenses and civil recovery mechanisms sufficient to reach organizers, facilitators, and materially supportive intermediaries;
	4.	carrier-level and gateway-level duties to authenticate caller identity, suppress spoofing, and block or rate-limit high-risk traffic after notice, with civil liability for willful or repeated transmission of non-authenticated fraudulent traffic;
	5.	felony penalties for trafficking in victim lists, stolen credentials, or access instruments used primarily to facilitate confidence exploitation, and lawful freezing procedures for clearly attributable proceeds, subject to due process;
	6.	a national victim restitution and recovery framework, including a compensation fund seeded by forfeited proceeds and governed by transparent rules that prioritize repayment to victims before fines or agency budgets.

All measures under this Section shall remain proportional, transparent to the maximum extent consistent with operational necessity, and subject to constitutional oversight, record preservation, and auditability under Articles XI and XIII.

Nothing in this Section shall be construed to compel universal real-name identity for private communications, mandate biometric enrollment for ordinary speech or association, require backdoors into end-to-end encryption, or authorize mass monitoring of private communications absent individualized suspicion and judicial process.

Section 7. Prohibition on Parallel or Fragmenting Currencies

No public authority shall authorize or tolerate parallel currencies that:
	1.	fragment the monetary unit of account;
	2.	function as employer or locality-controlled scrip;
	3.	undermine wage fungibility or free exit;
	4.	create dependency or coercive economic zones.
The validity of any currency, clearing system, or digital instrument governed by this Section shall be determined in the first instance by the Constitutional Review Court, subject to appellate or discretionary review by the Supreme Court of the Republic; CRC determinations shall be final if the Supreme Court declines review, unless the Constitutional Review Court certifies that the matter requires appellate consideration.This Section does not prohibit voluntary private exchange systems permitted under Article VIII-A or lawful alternatives recognized under Article X-A, provided they do not impersonate public currency or coerce participation.

Section 8. Clearing, Settlement, and Systemic Neutrality

Payment clearing and settlement systems operating within the Republic shall be neutral, auditable, and non-discriminatory.

No clearing system may deny service, delay settlement, or impose penalties based on lawful speech, political belief, or non-economic status.

This Article shall be interpreted to ensure that money remains a tool of exchange rather than an instrument of control.

⸻

Article XIII-C — Fiscal Integrity, Anti-Waste, and Asset Stewardship

Section 1. Prohibition of Baseline Budgeting

No budgetary authority, appropriation, or funding level shall be determined by reference to prior-year expenditure alone.

The use of “baseline budgeting,” “use-it-or-lose-it” allocation models, or any doctrine that incentivizes unnecessary expenditure to preserve future funding is hereby prohibited.

New or increased funding shall require affirmative justification independent of prior-year expenditure, demonstrating value added, necessity, and efficiency.

All appropriations shall be justified on demonstrated necessity, efficiency, and public benefit, independent of prior consumption.

⸻

Section 2. Carryover, Return, and Credit of Unused Funds

Unexpended public funds shall not be forfeited or penalized solely due to non-use.

Agencies shall be permitted, and encouraged, to:
	•	return unused funds to the Treasury;
	•	carry forward justified balances, subject to audit and reasonable limits defined by law.;
	•	receive credit for efficiency, conservation, and cost reduction.
Savings achieved through efficiency or conservation shall not trigger automatic future reductions or adverse personnel action.
No agency shall suffer reduction, retaliation, or loss of mission authority solely for spending less than appropriated.

⸻

Section 3. Prohibition on Destruction of Usable Public Assets

The intentional destruction, disposal, or disabling of functional public property, equipment, or supplies for the purpose of preserving budget authority, justifying procurement, or avoiding accounting adjustment is prohibited.

Usable assets shall be:
	•	redeployed,
	•	transferred,
	•	stored,
	•	sold,
	•	or returned to public inventory,

unless destruction is required for safety, security, or lawful demilitarization under strict oversight.
Mandatory redeployment or transfer screening shall precede any disposal or destruction of usable public assets.

⸻

Section 4. Procurement Integrity and Anti-Gaming Rule

No officer, agency, or contractor may procure goods or services without demonstrable necessity for current or reasonably anticipated public use.

Procurement undertaken primarily to:
	•	exhaust budgets,
	•	preserve funding levels,
	•	prevent future reductions,
	•	or manufacture apparent demand

shall constitute fiscal misconduct and breach of public trust..

⸻

Section 5. Audit, Enforcement, and Standing

Independent auditors shall review compliance with this Article.

Knowingly engaging in prohibited practices under this Article constitutes:
	•	breach of public trust,
	•	fiscal misconduct,
	•	and grounds for removal, sanction, and restitution.

Taxpayers, oversight bodies, and designated inspectors shall have standing to challenge violations.

Audits shall be conducted regularly and made publicly available, subject only to narrow security redactions.

⸻

Section 6. Prohibition on Monopoly Pricing and Certification Rent-Seeking

No public procurement shall be awarded on the basis of domestic origin, certification, or political designation where such designation is used to justify prices grossly exceeding fair market value for equivalent quality and performance.

The use of patriotic labeling, domestic-content rules, or regulatory exclusivity to extract monopoly rents from the public treasury is prohibited.

Goods priced substantially above market norms without demonstrable superiority in performance, security, or lifecycle cost shall be presumed noncompliant.

Such presumption may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence of superior performance, security, or lifecycle value.

⸻

Section 7. Conditional Domestic Preference (Good-Faith Rule)

Preference for goods manufactured within the Republic may be afforded only where domestic suppliers:

(a) offer goods of comparable quality and performance;
(b) price such goods within a reasonable margin of prevailing global market rates;
(c) do not rely on exclusive certification, political influence, or procurement lock-in to suppress competition.

Domestic preference shall not operate as an entitlement to supra-market pricing.

Failure to meet these conditions constitutes breach of patriotic duty and forfeiture of preferential treatment.

⸻

Section 8. Authorization of Foreign Procurement Upon Domestic Failure

Where domestic suppliers fail to provide goods of adequate quality at reasonable market-aligned prices, the Republic shall not be compelled to procure inferior or exorbitantly priced domestic alternatives.

In such cases, procurement of foreign-manufactured goods is authorized and shall not be deemed disloyal, unpatriotic, or contrary to national interest.

National interest is served by stewardship of public funds, readiness, quality, and resilience—not by enrichment of protected monopolies.

Overreliance on protected domestic monopolies that undermines readiness or supply resilience shall constitute domestic failure under this Section.

⸻

Section 9. Defense and Critical Systems Safeguard

For defense, public safety, and critical infrastructure procurement, comparative evaluation shall include:

(a) unit cost;
(b) performance under realistic conditions;
(c) durability and lifecycle cost;
(d) interoperability and logistics;
(e) security and supply resilience.

No vendor may rely solely on domestic origin to avoid comparative evaluation.

⸻

Section 10. Anti-Capture Enforcement

Knowingly approving or maintaining procurement arrangements that:

(a) impose extreme price disparities;
(b) suppress competitive sourcing without necessity;
(c) enrich vendors through political connection rather than value;
(d) shield suppliers from review under patriotic pretext;

constitutes fiscal misconduct and breach of public trust and may result in personal liability.

Standing to challenge such practices shall extend to auditors, inspectors, legislators, and taxpayers as provided by law.

⸻

Section 11. Construction

This Article shall be construed to:
	•	reward efficiency rather than consumption,
	•	preserve public assets,
	•	eliminate perverse incentives,
	•	and restore stewardship as the governing principle of public finance.
	•	support domestic industry in good faith;
	•	prohibit procurement parasitism disguised as patriotism;
	•	reward quality, efficiency, and resilience;
	•	preserve national capability without tolerating extortion.

No slogan, certification, or political designation shall override fiduciary duty to the People.
No emergency, national security claim, or administrative doctrine shall be used to revive baseline budgeting or justify waste.
Domestic origin shall be treated as a preference of good faith, not a license for extortion.

Article XIII-D — Lawful Federal Revenue Instruments
 Charge
The Republic shall fund the lawful operation of the federal government through transparent, proportionate, and non-extractive revenue instruments that attach to privilege, risk, harm, or voluntary use, rather than to mere existence, labor, or subsistence.
This Article clarifies and limits the authority of the federal government to collect fees, levies, fines, tariffs, and cost recoveries, while prohibiting disguised taxation, revenue maximization, and encroachment upon state authority over redistribution.

Section 1. Authorized Non-Tax Revenue Instruments
The Republic may collect non-tax revenues, including:
(a) licensing and permitting fees for regulated, privileged, or high-risk activity; (b) corporate charter issuance, renewal, maintenance, and compliance fees; (c) user fees for access to national infrastructure, systems, records, spectrum, or commons at scale; (d) fines, penalties, forfeitures, and clawbacks arising from violations of this Constitution or law; (e) cost recovery for litigation, investigations, audits, enforcement, adjudication, and remediation reasonably attributable to regulated conduct; (f) reasonable tariffs and border adjustments necessary to preserve fair trade, sound money, fiduciary parity, or domestic legal standards.
Revenue instruments under this Section shall not be construed as general taxation.

Section 2. Proportionality and Reasonableness Test
All fees, levies, fines, tariffs, and charges imposed under this Article shall satisfy a constitutional proportionality test.
A revenue instrument is lawful only where it is:
(a) reasonably related to a granted privilege, imposed risk, measurable harm, or specific public cost; (b) calibrated to recover costs, price risk, or remediate harm rather than maximize revenue; (c) transparent, published, and subject to public audit; (d) non-discriminatory among similarly situated parties; (e) incapable, in design or effect, of functioning as a disguised income, wealth, capitation, or consumption tax.
Revenue instruments that materially burden subsistence activity, ordinary labor, or non-commercial personal use are prohibited.

Section 3. Prohibition on Disguised Taxation and Revenue Maximization
Charges imposed under this Article shall not be varied, escalated, or justified on the basis of moral disapproval, social stigma, status signaling, or behavioral deterrence goals unrelated to proportional cost recovery, risk pricing, or remediation of concrete public harm.
No fee, levy, fine, tariff, or charge may be structured, escalated, or administered primarily for the purpose of general revenue generation, fiscal expansion, or behavioral coercion unrelated to a lawful regulatory, remedial, or cost-recovery objective.
Any revenue instrument whose primary effect is to extract general funds absent a nexus to privilege, harm, or cost shall be void.

Section 4. Judicial Review and Standing
Any person or entity subject to a charge under this Article has standing to challenge its constitutionality, including on grounds of excessiveness, arbitrariness, discrimination, lack of proportionality, or use as a disguised tax.
Courts shall review such challenges without deference.
Conversely, any attempt to evade lawful fees, fines, tariffs, or cost recovery through jurisdictional arbitrage, shell entities, artificial restructuring, or misclassification constitutes fiscal misconduct and may result in forfeiture of associated privileges, protections, or claims under law.

Section 5. Relationship to Taxation and State Authority
Nothing in this Article authorizes the federal government to impose general income taxation, wealth taxation, payroll taxation, or redistribution.
States retain exclusive authority over income redistribution, social spending, and general taxation, subject to this Constitution.
This Article shall be construed in harmony with Articles VIII, X, XIII-A, XIII-B, XIII-C, and XXXIX.

Section 6. Construction and Lock Protection
This Article shall be construed narrowly to preserve a limited federal fiscal footprint, prevent stealth taxation, and ensure that public power is funded by those who impose costs, extract value, or enjoy special privilege.
The prohibitions on general taxation, disguised taxation, revenue maximization, and non-proportional charges are structurally protected under Article XV. Only these limits, and not the enumerated instruments themselves, are subject to lock protection.
Article XIV — National Defense and Foreign Policy
 
Charge

This Article establishes constitutional rules governing national defense, the use of armed force, and the conduct of foreign relations by the Republic. All military and foreign policy powers shall be exercised solely pursuant to constitutional authorization, civilian control, and democratic accountability, and shall be construed narrowly to prevent unauthorized, indefinite, or unaccountable use of force. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to permit war, military action, or foreign entanglement except as expressly authorized by law and consistent with constitutional limits.

Legal Text
 
Section 1. Purpose of National Defense
 
The armed forces exist solely to:
 
a. defend the Republic against external armed aggression;
b. protect the constitutional order from armed overthrow;
c. secure the territory, airspace, and lawful maritime interests of the Republic;
d. deter threats through credible defense, not provocation, domination, or conquest.
 
Military force shall not be employed for ideological export, regime change absent direct threat, or indefinite occupation.

Section 2. Civilian Control of the Armed Forces
 
All military forces are subordinate to civilian authority under this Constitution.
 
No member of the armed forces shall exercise independent political authority or act outside lawful orders issued pursuant to constitutional process.
 
The oath of service binds all personnel to the Constitution, not to any individual, officeholder, party, alliance, or transient policy.

Section 2A. Authority and Obligation to Maintain Service Capacity
 
The Executive Branch, subject to law and legislative oversight, shall have authority to organize, equip, and maintain military forces, including the creation, reorganization, or dissolution of units, divisions, commands, and service branches as necessary for national defense.
 
The Republic shall maintain sufficient lawful service capacity to ensure that citizens eligible for civic service are not unreasonably denied the opportunity to fulfill service requirements established under Article III (Citizenship and Civic Duty).
 
Military force structure shall not be intentionally reduced, obstructed, bottlenecked, or outsourced in a manner that frustrates civic duty, concentrates access to citizenship, substitutes private entities for public service, or abdicates the Republic’s defensive obligations.
 
Nothing in this Section authorizes conscription, emergency expansion absent legislative approval, or the circumvention of constitutional limits on the use of force.

Section 3. Declaration of War, Authorization, and Use of Force
 
No war shall be declared, nor hostilities initiated or sustained, except by:

	2.	geographic scope;
	3.	named adversaries or targets;
	4.	legal basis;
	5.	maximum initial duration not exceeding one (1) year.
 
Reauthorization shall be required for continuation.

For purposes of this Article, an armed attack shall mean a kinetic or cyber action causing actual or imminent loss of life, territorial violation, or destruction of critical civilian or military infrastructure. Intelligence assessments, proxy actions, or speculative threats alone shall not suffice.

Section 4. Definition of War and Hostilities
 
For purposes of this Constitution, “war” and “hostilities” include, but are not limited to:
 
a. sustained or repeated airstrikes, drone strikes, missile strikes, naval actions, or cyber operations causing physical destruction or loss of life;
b. cumulative military actions that, taken together, constitute ongoing armed engagement;
c. blockades, kinetic interdictions, or coercive military actions framed as non-war measures.
 
No executive characterization shall exempt such actions from constitutional requirements.
 
Ambiguities shall be resolved against unilateral executive authority and in favor of legislative deliberation.

No authorization may exceed one (1) year without reauthorization.
 
Cumulative or recurring military actions related to the same conflict or adversary shall be treated as a single engagement for purposes of duration limits.
 
Failure to reauthorize shall mandate withdrawal, except where withdrawal would imminently endanger forces in the field.

Section 6. Limits on Emergency Military Authority
 
No declaration of emergency, national security threat, or foreign crisis shall:

c. permit indefinite military engagement without legislative authorization;
d. justify secrecy beyond strict operational necessity.
 
All emergency military authority is subject to Article XV and judicial review without deference.
Nothing in this Article shall be construed to authorize economic warfare, monetary coercion, or financial sabotage except as expressly permitted and constrained under Article XIII-B.

Section 7. Foreign Treaties, Alliances, and International Obligations
 
Treaties and international agreements shall require:
 
a. disclosure of all material obligations;

c. be prohibited from offensive combat absent explicit legislative authorization;
d. be individually accountable for unlawful acts.
 
No private force shall be used to evade constitutional war powers.

Section 10. Treatment of Service Members
 
Service members are citizens in uniform, not instruments.
 
They retain constitutional protections except where narrowly limited by necessity of service and due process.
 
No service member shall be compelled to obey unlawful orders. Obedience to unlawful orders shall not be a defense.

Section 11. Foreign Policy Restraint and Diplomacy
 
Foreign policy shall favor diplomacy, lawful trade, cultural exchange, and peaceful cooperation over coercion and force.
 
The Republic shall pursue a predisposition toward restraint and non-intervention, intervening only where constitutionally authorized and demonstrably necessary for defense.
 
Selective or undeclared interventions are prohibited.

Section 12. Judicial Review, Standing, and Remedies
 
Any Civic Citizen, service member, or state with standing may challenge violations of this Article, including ongoing unauthorized operations.
 
Courts may issue injunctive relief, withdrawal orders, and other remedies necessary to enforce constitutional limits.
 
Claims of military necessity or national security shall receive no deference where constitutional structure or rights are implicated.

Section 13. Prohibition on Perpetual Military Commitments
 
No military basing agreement, security pact, or foreign deployment arrangement shall create indefinite obligations.

never rule it.

 
Article XIV-A — Defense Governance and Accountability

Section 1. Non-Derogation and Relationship to Article XIV

This Article supplements Article XIV — National Defense and Foreign Policy.

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to expand war powers, diminish civilian supremacy, or weaken the constraints imposed by Article XIV.

Where doubt exists, the construction that most restricts unaccountable force shall control.

⸻

Section 2. Civilian Supremacy and Unified Command

All military and defense institutions remain subordinate to civilian authority.

No military, intelligence, or security body may exercise independent political authority, initiate hostilities, or define national policy.

Fragmentation of command to evade accountability is prohibited.

⸻

Section 3. Defense Procurement and Anti-Capture Doctrine

Defense procurement shall be transparent, competitive, and subject to continuous audit.

Prohibited practices include:
	1.	revolving-door inducements;
	2.	cost-plus structures without strict justification;
	3.	concealed subcontracting;
	4.	classified procurement used to suppress oversight.

Systemic procurement abuse constitutes capture of the war power.

⸻

Section 4. Intelligence Boundaries and Military Separation

Intelligence services shall support, not direct, military operations.

No intelligence body may:
	1.	initiate force;
	2.	conduct lethal operations absent lawful authorization;
	3.	substitute covert action for declared hostilities.

Intelligence is informational, not sovereign.

⸻

Section 5. Prohibition on Permanent or Private Militaries

Standing armed forces shall exist only under constitutional authorization.

Private military forces, mercenary organizations, or deniable proxy forces acting on behalf of the Republic are prohibited.

Delegation of violence to evade constitutional limits constitutes grave misconduct.

⸻

Section 6. Treatment of Service Members

Members of the armed forces remain citizens under law.

They retain:
	•	the duty to refuse unlawful orders;
	•	access to independent judicial review;
	•	protection from retaliation for lawful refusal.

No oath may bind service members to unconstitutional action.

⸻

Section 7. Veterans’ Obligations and Care

The Republic owes lifelong duty of care to those injured, disabled, or traumatized in its service.

Failure to provide adequate medical, psychological, and social support constitutes breach of public trust.

Veterans shall not be abandoned after lawful service.

⸻

Section 8. Transparency, Records, and Historical Accountability

Defense actions, procurement decisions, and intelligence-military coordination shall be preserved as public records, subject only to narrow and temporary classification.

Permanent secrecy regarding acts of force is prohibited.

This Section operates in coordination with Articles XI and XXXIX.

⸻

Section 9. Enforcement and Severity

Willful violation of this Article by public officials, commanders, or institutions constitutes abuse of constitutional authority.

Where such conduct involves concealment, unauthorized force, or systemic harm, it qualifies as a grave offense under Article 0 and is subject to Tier-3 escalation.

⸻

Section 10. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to ensure that force remains accountable, intelligence remains bounded, service remains honored, and war remains the exception rather than the norm.

⸻

Article XIV-B — Military Justice and Constitutional Subordination

Section 1. Establishment of Military Justice

The Republic may maintain a system of military justice to enforce discipline, readiness, lawful orders, and the laws of war within the Armed Forces.

Military justice exists to preserve lawful command — not to insulate the military from constitutional law.

Section 2. Jurisdiction

Military courts shall have jurisdiction only over:

(a) service members on active duty;
(b) offenses arising directly from military service;
(c) violations of the laws of war;
(d) conduct affecting readiness, security, or lawful command.

Military courts shall have no jurisdiction over:

(a) civilians;
(b) constitutional interpretation;
(c) the legality of war, surveillance, or detention;
(d) political, speech, or belief-based offenses.

Section 3. Due Process and Rights

Service members retain all constitutional rights except where narrowly limited by the necessities of service and due process.

No military tribunal may:
	•	deny counsel,
	•	suppress exculpatory evidence,
	•	use secret law, or
	•	impose punishment absent a public, recorded proceeding.

Section 4. Subordination to the Constitutional Review Court

All military justice proceedings, including courts-martial and disciplinary actions, shall be subject to constitutional review by the Constitutional Review Court for:

(a) jurisdiction;
(b) legality of orders;
(c) constitutional compliance;
(d) proportionality of punishment.

The CRC shall have authority to:
	•	stay proceedings;
	•	suppress unlawfully obtained evidence;
	•	vacate unlawful convictions;
	•	enjoin unconstitutional prosecutions.

Decisions of the CRC are subject to appellate review by the Supreme Court of the Republic.

Section 5. Protection Against Command Influence

No commander or chain of command may:

(a) direct the outcome of any military judicial proceeding;
(b) retaliate against a service member for lawful defense or refusal of unlawful orders;
(c) interfere with counsel, evidence, or review.

Violations constitute grave offenses.

Section 6. Institutional Integrity and the CJC

The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have authority to:

(a) audit military courts, JAG offices, and disciplinary systems;
(b) investigate retaliation, command coercion, or secret tribunals;
(c) certify institutional capture or abuse;
(d) petition the CRC for emergency relief, suspension of proceedings, or structural remedies.

No military justice system may operate beyond civilian constitutional oversight.

Section 7. No Emergency or War Exception

No state of war, emergency, or national security claim may suspend:

(a) CRC review;
(b) CJC oversight;
(c) service member due process; or
(d) the prohibition on secret tribunals.

Military necessity does not override constitutional law.

Section 8. Construction

This Article shall be construed to ensure:
	•	discipline without tyranny,
	•	obedience without blind loyalty,
	•	readiness without lawlessness, and
	•	a military that serves the Republic, not itself.


Article XV — Amendments, Lock Clauses, and Anti-Emergency Drift

Charge

This Article establishes the exclusive procedures and requirements by which this Constitution may be amended, corrected, or clarified. All amendment powers shall be exercised openly, deliberately, and in strict conformity with the processes set forth herein, and shall not be expanded or bypassed by emergency, necessity, or convenience. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to permit suspension, alteration, or informal modification of constitutional provisions outside the amendment process expressly authorized by this Constitution.


Legal Text

Section 1. Supremacy of This Article

This Article governs all constitutional amendment, suspension, modification, interpretation, emergency authority, and claims of necessity.

No statute, treaty, executive action, judicial doctrine, regulation, administrative interpretation, or emergency declaration may alter, bypass, suspend, reinterpret, or override this Article.
Any attempt to do so is null and void.
For purposes of this Article, “interpretation” includes judicial doctrine, tests, standards of review, balancing frameworks, and deference regimes.

Section 2. Classes of Constitutional Provisions

The Constitution is composed of three classes of provisions:

a. Unamendable Core Principles
b. Structurally Locked Provisions
c. Generally Amendable Provisions

No provision may be reclassified except through amendment procedures applicable to the higher class.

Section 2A. Recognition of Article-Level Locks
Lock declarations contained within individual Articles of this Constitution are fully valid, self-executing, and of equal force to locks designated by appendix, index, or global classification.

Where an Article declares itself locked or subject to heightened amendment or interpretive constraints, that declaration shall govern the amendment, interpretation, and enforcement of that Article according to its own terms and in harmony with this Article.

No court, authority, or officer may deny effect to an Article-level lock on grounds of placement, form, or location.


Section 3. Unamendable Core Principles (Eternity Clauses)

The following principles are permanent and unamendable and shall not be repealed, suspended, modified, reinterpreted, or overridden by any authority, at any time, for any reason:

a. the supremacy of this Constitution over all other law;
b. the sovereignty of the People as the sole source of political authority;
c. the separation of powers among Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches;
d. the prohibition of hereditary, purchased, corporate, algorithmic, or non-human political authority;
e. the requirement of civic citizenship, earned through service and duty, as a prerequisite for voting and holding public office;
f. the prohibition on suspension of constitutional rights by emergency, decree, necessity, or reinterpretation;
g. the guarantee of due process and equal protection under law;
h. the prohibition of perpetual or rolling emergency powers;
i. the right of lawful resistance to constitutional violations as defined elsewhere in this Constitution;
j. the prohibition on federal coercion of state sovereignty through fiscal dependency, conditional funding, or economic pressure;
k. the prohibition on federal preemption of state law by regulation absent express legislative authorization and constitutional necessity;
l. the right of states to decline participation in non-mandatory federal programs without retaliation or deprivation of unrelated funds;
m. the right of citizens to challenge federal encroachment upon state sovereignty through judicial process;
n. the prohibition on sovereign immunity where the federal government unlawfully intrudes upon powers reserved to the states.
Any act purporting to amend, suspend, or circumvent these principles is void ab initio and constitutes oathbreaking.

o. no private contract, covenant, oath, or obligation may bind any natural person beyond the lifetime of the consenting party, except where expressly authorized by this Constitution. All such obligations expire at death. No contract purporting to bind an individual beyond their natural lifetime shall be enforceable, except where expressly permitted by this Constitution.


Section 4. Structurally Locked Provisions

Structurally locked provisions include, but are not limited to:

a. amendment procedures and thresholds;
b. electoral integrity mechanisms;
c. legislative transparency and integrity requirements;
d. federalism and reserved powers;
e. judicial independence and limits;
f. anti-capture, anti-corruption, and public stewardship requirements;
g. sunset, reauthorization, and outcome-based governance mandates;
h. limitations on federal funding conditions and fiscal coercion of states;
i. limitations on regulatory preemption of state law;
j. program sunset, outcome review, automatic devolution, and state opt-out rights.

These provisions may be amended only through the procedures in Section 6 and may not be altered, suspended, or bypassed during declared emergencies.

Section 5. Generally Amendable Provisions

All constitutional provisions not listed in Sections 3 or 4 are generally amendable, subject to the procedures and safeguards of this Article.

No amendment may contradict, undermine, or indirectly erode unamendable or structurally locked provisions.

Section 6. Amendment Procedures

An amendment, repeal, suspension, correction, clarification, or material reinterpretation of this Constitution may be proposed and adopted only by one of the exclusive methods set forth in Section 20.

Without limiting Section 20, a popular proposal by national civic petition shall meet thresholds defined by law and consistent with Article XXVII.
Such thresholds shall be no lower than ten percent (10%) of Civic Citizens, unless this Constitution expressly provides otherwise.

All proposed amendments shall:
be single-subject;
include a plain-language explanation of purpose and effect;
disclose all affected provisions;
state anticipated risks, tradeoffs, and consequences.

Amendment Thresholds:
Unless this Constitution expressly provides otherwise, any amendment, repeal, suspension, or material reinterpretation of a provision shall require adoption by one of the three methods in Section 20, and shall additionally require:

(a) certification by the Supreme Court that the change does not diminish substantive rights or enforcement mechanisms protected under lock clauses;
(b) independent review by the Constitutional Judicial Commission affirming absence of institutional capture, coercion, or pretextual motivation.

Section 18 governs unlocking lock-protected provisions, including the applicable supermajority threshold and safeguards for unlocking.

Section 7. Temporal Safeguards

No amendment may be:

a. introduced, voted upon, or ratified during a declared national emergency;
b. fast-tracked, bundled, or exempted from public review;
c. applied retroactively to immunize wrongdoing or shield prior violations.

A minimum public deliberation period of ninety (90) days shall apply to all amendments.
No temporary, provisional, pilot, sunset-based, or experimental measure may bypass or suspend constitutional requirements.

Section 8. Prohibition on Emergency Constitutional Alteration

No emergency, war, disaster, economic crisis, public health threat, or security concern shall justify:

a. suspension of constitutional rights;
b. alteration of amendment procedures;
c. concentration of power beyond constitutional limits;
d. reinterpretation of this Constitution to expand authority.

Emergency powers may coordinate action, not rewrite law.

Section 8A. Emergency Coordination Without Constitutional Displacement

In cases of declared national emergency, including invasion, insurrection, or catastrophic disaster, the federal government may exercise temporary coordinating authority solely for the purpose of resource alignment and intergovernmental cooperation.

Such authority is permitted only where:

a. approval by a sixty percent (60%) vote of both legislative houses;
b. limited to coordination, not command or displacement of state law;
c. does not suspend constitutional rights or alter constitutional structure;
d. expires automatically after ninety (90) days unless renewed by identical vote;
e. is subject to immediate and non-deferential judicial review.

Emergency authority shall not create precedent, implied power, or interpretive expansion.

Section 9. Automatic Rollback of Emergency Authority

All emergency powers shall:

a. be expressly enumerated by statute;
b. be narrowly tailored;
c. expire automatically without renewal.

Upon expiration, all actions taken under emergency authority shall revert to constitutional baseline.

No emergency power may create precedent.

Section 10. Judicial Review and Burden of Proof

All claims of emergency necessity, constitutional reinterpretation, implied authority, or federal preemption shall be subject to immediate CRC judicial review without deference.

The burden of proof rests entirely on the authority asserting necessity or supremacy.

Citizens may challenge federal actions that unlawfully undermine legitimate state law or state sovereignty, independent of state participation or consent.

Silence, ambiguity, historical practice, or administrative convenience shall not suffice. Constitutional silence shall not be construed as permission to alter, amend, or reallocate power.

Section 11. Personal Accountability for Abuse

Any official who knowingly:

a. exceeds emergency authority;
b. enforces unconstitutional orders;
c. attempts constitutional alteration outside this Article;
d. conceals, misrepresents, or fabricates emergency justification;

shall be personally liable under law, in addition to removal from office.

No immunity attaches to constitutional violation.

Section 12. Treaty and International Constraint Clause

No treaty, international agreement, compact, or foreign obligation may:

a. amend this Constitution;
b. supersede constitutional rights;
c. bind the Republic beyond the powers granted herein;
d. require coercion of state participation in federal programs;
e. impose regulatory preemption absent constitutional authorization.

Treaties inconsistent with this Constitution are void.

Section 13. Federal–State Program Sunset and Devolution

All federal programs materially affecting state governance, regulatory authority, or fiscal structure shall expire after ten (10) years unless affirmatively reauthorized through the full legislative process.

Each such program shall state explicit, measurable objectives.

Failure to meet stated objectives shall trigger automatic review and presumptive devolution of authority to the states.

No emergency declaration may suspend this requirement.

Section 14. State Exit Rights and Fiscal Rebalancing

States may opt out of participation in federal programs not constitutionally mandatory.

Upon opt-out, the state shall receive a proportional tax rebate or fiscal credit reflecting its contribution, adjusted for shared national obligations.

No opt-out shall result in punitive withholding of unrelated funds, services, or protections.

This right shall not be suspended by statute, regulation, emergency, or treaty.

Section 15. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to:

a. preserve constitutional continuity;
b. prevent erosion by exception;
c. deny legitimacy to fear-based governance;
d. favor liberty, accountability, and restraint over expedience.

The Constitution shall not die quietly.

Section 16. Prohibition on Emergency Circumvention

No declaration of emergency, national security crisis, public health order, economic emergency, invasion, rebellion, martial law, or any other exigency may suspend, waive, limit, or circumvent any provision of this Constitution, including lock-protected rights, due process guarantees, or definitions in Article 0.
Temporary protective measures (e.g., extreme risk protection orders, judicially supervised civil holds) are permissible only when strictly necessary, time-limited, individualized, supported by clear and convincing evidence of an Imminent and Specific Risk (as defined in Article 0), and subject to immediate adversarial review and restoration. Such measures are civil in nature and do not constitute suspension or derogation of constitutional rights.
Any attempt to use emergency authority for permanent structural change, rights erosion, or pretextual coercion (as defined in Article 0) is void ab initio and constitutes a grave offense.

Section 17. Lock-Protected Provisions

Provisions designated as lock-protected (including but not limited to Article II in its entirety, Article III earned civic citizenship, Article XXVI Charter of Inviolable Rights, and all cross-references to definitions in Article 0 that support these Articles) may not be repealed, suspended, weakened, narrowed, reinterpreted, or rendered ineffectual except by the highest procedural threshold above and only for the purpose of clarifying consistency or expanding protections.
New lock designations may be added by constitutional amendment meeting the above requirements, or by legislative act ratified by a seventy-five percent (75%) supermajority of both chambers and signed by the Executive, provided the addition strengthens liberty, accountability, or sovereignty rather than restricting it.
Lock-protected provisions include, but are not limited to, Article XXX (Federal Enforcement Authority, Accountability, and Civic Restraint) in its entirety; Article XXIV (Federal Law Enforcement and the Use of State Force) in its entirety; the separation of intelligence and law enforcement; prohibitions on entrapment and manufactured radicalization; safeguards governing automated integrity monitoring; and the affirmative duty to dissolve corrupt enforcement bodies.
For purposes of this Article, ‘highest procedural threshold’ means: (i) the Section 6 Amendment Thresholds for structurally locked provisions; and (ii) where Section 18 applies, the Section 18 unlocking threshold plus all Section 18 procedural safeguards.
While a provision remains lock-protected, amendments may only clarify consistency or expand protections; any other change requires unlocking under Section 18.

Section 18. Unlocking Lock-Protected Provisions

(a) Purpose and Narrow Construction
Lock-protected provisions exist to prevent short-term passions, capture, or emergency opportunism from weakening core rights, caps, floors, prohibitions, and structural safeguards. Unlocking is permitted, but shall occur only through a heightened process that is insulated from bundling, deception, and procedural laundering.

(b) Methods and No Bypass
Unlocking may be accomplished only by one of the exclusive methods in Section 20, and only upon satisfaction of this Section.
No statute, court, commission, or officer may treat a lock-protected provision as unlocked by interpretation, necessity, “balancing,” implied power, emergency, or administrative convenience.

(c) Single-Subject and Explicit Targeting
An unlocking measure must identify, by citation, the exact lock-protected provision(s) to be unlocked and shall address no other subject. Any measure that bundles unlocking with unrelated policy change, appropriations, or institutional re-structuring is void.

(d) Plain-Language and Disclosure Requirements
Any unlocking measure must satisfy amendment-grade safeguards, including:
(1) a plain-language explanation of purpose and legal effect;
(2) a redline-style disclosure of the exact textual change(s) to the lock status and any intended amendment text if paired under subsection (i);
(3) a disclosure of all provisions whose operation would be altered directly or by necessary implication; and
(4) a public posting period sufficient for review, as specified by law consistent with this Constitution.

(e) Petition Gate
Where unlocking proceeds by national referendum, no unlocking measure may be placed on the ballot absent a petition threshold of not less than twenty percent (20%) of Civic Citizens, verified within a fixed statutory period.

(f) Cooling-Off and Anti-Spam
No substantially similar unlocking measure concerning the same lock-protected provision(s) may be initiated more than once within one hundred eighty (180) days following a failed vote, absent material change as defined in Article 0, Section 4.4.

(g) Approval Threshold
Unlocking a lock-protected provision requires approval by not less than seventy percent (70%) of the deciding body under the chosen method in Section 20, and no lesser threshold shall suffice.

(h) Turnout Floor (Anti-Low-Turnout Capture)
No unlocking referendum shall be valid unless participation meets a minimum turnout floor established by this Constitution or by national law enacted pursuant to it, which shall be set high enough to prevent factional capture through low-participation elections.

(i) Unlock-and-Amend, or Unlock-Only
An unlocking measure may be presented as:
(1) Unlock-only: removing lock protection while leaving the text otherwise unchanged; or
(2) Unlock-and-amend: unlocking and adopting a specific amendment text simultaneously.
Where presented as unlock-and-amend, both the unlocking and the amendment text must satisfy all requirements of this Section, including the single-subject rule and the seventy percent (70%) threshold.

(j) Certification for Form and Honesty (Not Merit)
Prior to ballot placement (or, where applicable, prior to final adoption), the CJC and the CRC shall certify only:
(1) single-subject compliance;
(2) plain-language sufficiency and accurate disclosure of legal effect; and
(3) absence of procedural laundering, deception, or hidden alteration of caps, floors, prohibitions, or jurisdictional limits.
Neither body may veto an unlocking measure based on policy disagreement.

(k) Timing Restrictions
No unlocking referendum may be conducted during a declared emergency or within a constitutionally defined cooling period after an emergency, as specified by law consistent with this Constitution.

(l) Effect of Successful Unlock
Upon successful unlock, the provision remains fully operative but becomes amendable under the ordinary amendment rules of this Constitution, except as otherwise restricted herein. Any subsequent amendment must still comply with all applicable rights protections, due process constraints, and anti-capture safeguards.
Unlocking measures and any paired amendments are subject to the Decennial Reaffirmation and Automatic Reversion requirements of this Article.

Section 19. Decennial Reaffirmation of Amendments; Automatic Reversion

(a) Provisional Adoption; Required Reaffirmation; Reaffirmation Window
Every constitutional amendment adopted under this Article shall remain subject to a mandatory reaffirmation referendum conducted during the tenth (10th) year after the amendment’s effective date, within a fixed window defined by law.

If the reaffirmation referendum is not conducted within that window, the amendment automatically reverts at the close of the window as though it failed reaffirmation.

(b) Reaffirmation Threshold
An amendment shall become permanent only if reaffirmed by a simple majority (50% + 1) of participating Civic Citizens in the reaffirmation referendum.

(c) Automatic Reversion Upon Failure
If an amendment fails reaffirmation, the Constitution shall automatically revert to the text and legal effect that existed immediately prior to that amendment, effective upon certification of the referendum result.
No further legislative or judicial act shall be required to restore the prior text.

(d) Ballot Clarity
The reaffirmation ballot shall present the amendment as adopted and shall ask, in plain language, whether the People reaffirm it to remain in force.
No reaffirmation ballot may bundle multiple amendments.

(e) Single Reaffirmation
An amendment reaffirmed under this Section shall thereafter remain in force unless amended or repealed pursuant to this Article. No further periodic reaffirmation is required.

(f) Savings and Stability
Reversion under this Section shall not:
(1) void final judgments entered while the amendment was in force, absent independent constitutional defect or fraud;
(2) impair vested private rights lawfully accrued in reliance on the amendment, where such impairment would violate due process; or
(3) invalidate completed governmental acts that were lawful when performed;
provided that all ongoing enforcement, future legal standards, and prospective governmental actions shall conform to the restored constitutional text upon reversion.

(g) Application to Unlocking
An unlocking measure, whether unlock-only or unlock-and-amend, constitutes a constitutional alteration for purposes of this Section and shall be subject to reaffirmation and potential reversion on the same terms.

Section 20. Methods of Constitutional Amendment, Repeal, Locking, and Unlocking

(a) Exclusive Methods
This Constitution may be amended, repealed, locked, or unlocked only by one of the following three methods:

(1) Legislative Supermajority Method.
Approval by a supermajority vote of both legislative houses as defined by the Supermajority Rule, together with all certifications and procedural safeguards required by this Constitution for the category of change sought.

(2) Convention of the States Method.
Approval by a Convention of the States conducted under this Constitution, requiring concurrence of not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the States, together with all certifications and procedural safeguards required by this Constitution for the category of change sought.

(3) Popular Supermajority Method.
Approval by national referendum of Civic Citizens, requiring a supermajority vote as defined by the Supermajority Rule; provided that any measure whose purpose includes Unlocking under Section 18 shall require the unlocking threshold of Section 18(g).

(b) Equal Validity
Any method listed in subsection (a) is sufficient to enact constitutional change without requiring approval by the other methods, except where this Constitution expressly provides otherwise for unamendable provisions.

(c) Single-Subject and Plain-Language Safeguards
All measures under any method shall comply with single-subject form, plain-language requirements, and disclosure of legal effect, and shall be void if adopted through bundling, deception, or procedural laundering.

Section 21. Lock Designation
This Article (including all lock designation procedures, anti-emergency rules, and supermajority thresholds) is itself lock-protected and may not be amended except by the highest procedural threshold and certification of non-diminishment.
Article XV-A — Emergency Powers Harmonization

Section 1. Non-Derogation and Relationship to Article XV

This Article supplements Article XV.

No declaration of emergency, necessity, crisis, or exigency shall suspend, override, condition, delay, or evade any provision of this Constitution unless such suspension is expressly authorized by this Constitution and explicitly names the affected Article and Section.

No emergency authority exercised under this Article shall suspend, override, delay, or condition the operation of Article XXVIII-A — State Nullification and Federalism Safeguards.

Where doubt exists, the construction that most preserves rights and limits power shall control.

⸻

Section 2. Single-Emergency Rule

At any given time, all asserted emergency powers exercised by the Republic shall be treated as part of a single constitutional emergency, regardless of label, agency, or domain.

No authority may segment, stack, or relabel emergencies to evade constitutional limits.

⸻

Section 3. Duration  Harmonization

All emergency authorities expire after ninety (90) days unless renewed pursuant to this Article, and no emergency authority may be renewed more than once absent materially new facts.

Where multiple emergency authorities prescribe different durations, the shortest duration shall control.

Extensions may occur only through the strictest renewal process applicable among the invoked authorities.

Rolling or serial emergencies are prohibited.

⸻

Section 4. Scope Harmonization

Where multiple emergency provisions authorize differing scopes of action, the narrowest scope shall control.

Emergency authority shall be limited to actions strictly necessary to address the precipitating condition.

Generalized, anticipatory, or speculative measures are prohibited.

⸻

Section 5. Rights-Preserving Tie-Breaker

Where emergency authorities conflict, the interpretation that most preserves individual rights, due process, and civilian supremacy shall prevail.

No emergency interpretation may diminish non-derogable rights or locked provisions.

⸻

Section 6. Cross-Article Emergency Claims

No authority may invoke emergency language from one Article to bypass constraints imposed by another.

Emergency provisions shall be read in coordination, not isolation.

⸻

Delay shall not be justified by crisis.

⸻

Section 8. Automatic Reversion and Cleanup

	1.	all extraordinary powers immediately cease;
	2.	all emergency rules automatically sunset;
	3.	all records are preserved as public records;
	4.	all actions taken are subject to retrospective review.

Failure to revert constitutes a continuing constitutional violation.

⸻

Section 9. Anti-Precedent Rule

No emergency action, interpretation, or practice may be cited as precedent for future authority.

Emergency governance is inherently non-precedential.

⸻

Section 10. Enforcement and Severity

Willful violation of this Article by public officials or institutions constitutes abuse of constitutional authority.

Where such violation involves concealment, persistence beyond authorization, or systemic harm, it qualifies as a grave offense under Article 0 and is subject to Tier-3 escalation.

⸻

Section 11. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to ensure that emergencies do not become mechanisms of constitutional erosion.

Where doubt exists, the construction that most rapidly restores normal constitutional order shall control.

⸻

Article XVI — Elections and Democratic Legitimacy

Disputes shall be adjudicated only by the Election Oversight Tribunal or the Constitutional Review Court, with the Constitutional Review Court possessing mandatory jurisdiction over claims alleging constitutional violation, systemic manipulation, or loss of democratic legitimacy.

c. Remedies

Remedies must be proportional and narrowly tailored.

(1) a two-thirds finding by the Election Oversight Tribunal and confirmation by the Constitutional Review Court; or
(2) a Supreme Court finding of irreparable constitutional destruction.

e. Scope and Targeting of Electoral Remedies

Any nullification, invalidation, recall, forced re-election, or removal exercised pursuant to this Article shall be specific to the office, contest, or electoral body directly affected.
No single petition, tribunal finding, judicial order, or popular act may dissolve, purge, or invalidate an entire branch of government in aggregate.
Executive officers shall be removable individually by office.
Legislative bodies may be subject to re-election by chamber, not jointly.

Certified elections require peaceful transfer of power.

d. Right of Resistance

When a government systematically subverts elections, suppresses lawful remedies, and rules without genuine consent—upon a two-thirds declaration by State legislatures convened in constitutional convention or a Supreme Court finding of irreparable constitutional destruction—the People retain the inherent right of resistance, including insurrection, as a last resort.

This right arises only when constitutional order has been destroyed, not merely when outcomes are disputed.

e. Enduring Covenant

Where elections are honest, the Republic endures. Where elections are corrupted, liberty collapses.

f. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to preserve trust between the People and their institutions, recognizing that without trust, law decays into force, and authority into tyranny.

Article XVI-A — Election Integrity and Auditability

Section 1. Non-Derogation and Relationship to Article XVI

This Article supplements Article XVI — Elections and Democratic Legitimacy.

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to modify, narrow, relax, or reinterpret any requirement, prohibition, or safeguard established in Article XVI.

Where doubt exists, the construction that most preserves electoral legitimacy and public trust shall control.

⸻

Section 2. Chain-of-Custody as a Constitutional Requirement

All ballots, records, and election materials shall be subject to continuous, documented chain-of-custody from issuance through final certification.

Any break, ambiguity, or undocumented transfer in custody creates a rebuttable presumption of compromise.

Chain-of-custody records shall be public records.

⸻

Section 3. Auditability and Public Verification

All elections shall be auditable by independent observers using methods that are:
	1.	publicly observable,
	2.	repeatable,
	3.	comprehensible to a reasonable citizen,
	4.	independent of proprietary claims.

No election outcome may rely exclusively on processes that cannot be meaningfully audited by human review.

⸻

Section 4. Technology Neutrality and Burden of Proof

No voting or tabulation technology is presumed valid by default.

The burden of proof rests on the authority employing any technology to demonstrate:
	1.	transparency,
	2.	resistance to tampering,
	3.	verifiability independent of vendor assertions,
	4.	absence of remote or covert alteration capability.

Failure to meet this burden prohibits use.

⸻

Section 5. Software and Vendor Restrictions

Election software, firmware, and tabulation systems shall be:
	1.	open to inspection,
	2.	version-controlled,
	3.	publicly documented,
	4.	reproducible from source where applicable.

Proprietary secrecy shall not defeat audit, review, or challenge.

Vendor indemnification clauses shall not shield liability for failure, fraud, or concealment.

⸻

Section 6. Escalation Triggers and Automatic Review

	1.	material chain-of-custody defects;
	2.	statistically anomalous results inconsistent with observable conditions;

	4.	documented interference or suppression.

Discretionary refusal to review under such conditions is prohibited.
Where escalation is triggered under this Section, the Constitutional Review Court shall have mandatory and expedited jurisdiction to order audits, recounts, preservation of evidence, and injunctions against certification.

⸻

Section 7. Failure Resolution and Election Invalidation

Where integrity defects cannot be cured through audit or recount, the affected election or contest shall be invalidated.

Certification shall not occur where legitimacy cannot be affirmatively demonstrated.

No authority may certify an election solely to preserve continuity or convenience.

⸻

Section 8. Remedies and Temporary Governance

In the event of invalidation:
	1.	lawful interim governance shall proceed under existing constitutional succession rules;
	2.	prompt re-election shall occur under corrected conditions;
	3.	emergency powers shall not be invoked to bypass re-election.

Continuity does not justify legitimacy failure.

⸻

Section 9. Accountability and Severity

Willful interference with election integrity, auditability, or review constitutes abuse of democratic authority.

Where such conduct is systemic, coordinated, or outcome-determinative, it qualifies as a grave offense under Article 0 and is subject to Tier-3 escalation.

⸻

Section 10. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to ensure that electoral outcomes are provable, not presumed.

Where doubt exists, the construction that favors verification over finality shall control.

⸻

Article XVI-B — Popular Recall, Removal, and Institutional Dissolution

Section 1 — Affirmation of Popular Authority

The People retain the sovereign authority to recall, remove, expel, or otherwise terminate the service of any public official, officer, or appointee, and to dissolve governmental agencies or administrative bodies that are corrupt, hostile to constitutional order, or persistently fail in their lawful duties.

This authority is fundamental and shall not be construed narrowly.

⸻

Section 2 — Scope Limitation and Targeting Requirement

The exercise of popular recall, expulsion, or dissolution under this Constitution shall be specific and targeted.

No single popular petition, vote, or action may:
	•	dissolve an entire constitutional branch of government in aggregate;
	•	vacate all offices within a branch simultaneously; or
	•	extinguish a constitutionally required governmental function.

Popular remedies shall operate against persons, offices, agencies, or discrete institutional components, not against constitutional structures as a whole.

⸻

Section 3 — Personnel Removal Distinguished from Functional Abolition

The removal of officials, officers, or employees shall not be construed as the abolition of the constitutional powers or duties attached to their offices.

Where an office or agency is dissolved by popular action:
	•	the function it performed shall remain constitutionally required unless expressly eliminated by constitutional amendment;
	•	the temporary absence of an office shall not excuse nonperformance of constitutional duties.

⸻

Section 4 — Mandatory Reconstitution of Essential Functions

Upon the dissolution or vacancy of an agency, department, or office charged with executing a constitutional or statutory function:
	1.	The Executive shall be affirmatively obligated to:
	•	reconstitute the function in a lawful form;
	•	appoint new leadership and personnel, as required;
	•	restore operational capacity without undue delay.
	2.	Reconstitution may include:
	•	restructuring or renaming the agency;
	•	replacement of personnel in whole or in part;
	•	alteration of internal organization;
but shall not include permanent abdication of the function.

Failure to reconstitute a required function constitutes a constitutional violation.

⸻

Section 5 — Legislative and Judicial Symmetry

Popular recall and removal powers shall apply with equal force to:
	•	executive officers;
	•	individual legislators;
	•	legislative chambers (one chamber at a time);
	•	individual judicial officers, including a chief justice.

The judiciary and legislature as institutions shall not be dissolved in their entirety by a single popular act.

⸻

Section 6 — Anti-Abuse and Continuity Safeguard

All exercises of popular recall or dissolution shall:
	•	preserve constitutional continuity;
	•	avoid the creation of institutional vacuums;
	•	be executed in a manner consistent with public order and lawful transition.

The People’s sovereign authority to correct government abuse shall not be construed to authorize constitutional self-destruction.

⸻

Section 7 — Construction and Precedence

This Article governs the scope and effect of popular recall, expulsion, and institutional dissolution throughout this Constitution.

In the event of conflict or ambiguity, this Article shall control.

⸻Article XVII — Corporate Legitimacy and Accountability

Charge

This Article establishes constitutional requirements governing the formation, recognition, regulation, and accountability of corporations and similar artificial entities within the Republic. Corporate status shall confer no sovereign authority and shall remain subordinate to law, public oversight, and the rights of natural persons. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to grant corporate privileges, immunities, or legal standing beyond those expressly authorized by law and consistent with constitutional limits.


Legal Text

Section 1. Nature of Corporate Existence

(a) No Natural Right
Corporations possess no natural, inherent, or inalienable rights. They exist solely by charter, license, or recognition granted by the Republic for defined productive purposes. Corporate existence is a privilege, not a right.

(b) Instrumental Character
A corporation is a legal instrument through which natural persons act. It shall not be treated as a moral person, citizen, or sovereign entity. Rights extended to corporations exist only insofar as they are necessary to enable lawful productive activity and accountability.

(c) Subordination to the Republic
All corporations are subordinate to the Constitution, the sovereignty of the Republic, the welfare of the People, and the rule of law. No corporate interest may supersede these obligations.

Section 2. Legitimate Purposes

(a) Productive Purpose Requirement
Corporations may be formed only for legitimate productive purposes, including creation of goods or services, employment of labor, innovation and research, infrastructure development, lawful trade and commerce, and charitable or educational activity conducted in good faith. Formation for predatory, manipulative, extractive, or purely rent-seeking purposes is prohibited.

(b) Prohibited Corporate Purposes
It is unlawful to form or operate a corporation primarily for hostile takeovers intended to destroy productive capacity, concealment of assets, ownership, or intent, evasion of legal or moral accountability, laundering of foreign or illicit influence, manipulation of markets, elections, or public institutions, destabilization of communities, food systems, or governance, or coordinated harm to the Republic or its People. Such purposes render a corporation illegitimate ab initio. A finding of illegitimacy ab initio shall require determination by the Constitutional Review Court based on evidence of primary purpose, intent, and material conduct.

Section 3. Transparency and Accountability

(a) Beneficial Ownership
All corporations shall disclose their true beneficial owners and controlling interests. Layered entities, nominees, shell structures, trusts, and artificial partitions shall not obscure accountability. For constitutional purposes, ownership, control, coordination, and common management shall be aggregated regardless of legal form. The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to audit, investigate, and certify whether beneficial ownership, shell structures, or artificial partitions are being used to evade accountability under this Article.

(b) Substance Over Form
Courts shall evaluate corporate conduct by material outcomes and intent, not by nominal compliance or formal structure. Legal form shall not shield substantive wrongdoing.

(c) Piercing of the Corporate Veil
Where a corporation is used to commit wrongdoing, evade law, sabotage public systems, or cause grave harm, courts shall pierce the corporate veil without limitation. Veil piercing shall occur through process before the Constitutional Review Court, with personal liability attaching only to natural persons found culpable by evidence of control, intent, or knowing participation.

Section 4. Grave Corporate Offenses

(a) Definition
A corporation commits a grave offense when it knowingly or recklessly engages in conduct that undermines the sovereignty of the Republic, corrupts public institutions, poisons land, food, water, or people, enables trafficking, slavery, or systemic exploitation, engineers dependency or artificial scarcity, manipulates law, science, information, or technology with knowing falsehood or reckless disregard for truth to cause public harm, or obstructs or sabotages the public commons after lawful sunset or convergence. For purposes of this Section, ‘knowingly or recklessly’ requires actual knowledge, willful blindness, or conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk of public harm.

(b) Third-Tier Classification
Grave corporate offenses may be classified as third-tier crimes where scale, intent, or impact warrants. ‘Third-tier crimes’ shall have the meaning, evidentiary standards, and penalties set forth in Article VII. Corporate form shall not mitigate severity.
(c) Constitutional Judicial Commission
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to investigate and certify whether conduct under this Section constitutes institutional capture, foreign influence, or coordinated economic warfare, and may petition the Constitutional Review Court for Tier-Three classification.


Section 5. Remedies and Sanctions

(a) Dissolution
Upon Constitutional Review Court finding of grave offense, a corporation may be dissolved, stripped of charter, or barred permanently from reconstitution under any form.

(b) Forfeiture
Assets used to commit or conceal wrongdoing may be seized and repurposed for restitution or public benefit, with priority given to non-culpable parties such as employees (wages and pensions) and small shareholders before public use.

(c) Criminal Prosecution
Natural persons responsible shall be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. No fine shall substitute for accountability.

(d) Enemy of the Republic
Where a corporate entity acts maliciously, systematically, and evidentially against the Republic, it may be designated an Enemy of the Republic following rigorous evidentiary review, scientific and factual assessment of harm and intent, and judicial determination by seven-ninths vote of the Supreme Court with public findings, following an evidentiary record developed by the Constitutional Review Court. Designation as an Enemy of the Republic shall require clear and convincing evidence of malicious intent, systematic conduct, and grave harm, with findings addressing necessity, proportionality, and exhaustion of lesser remedies. Such designation shall apply only to the offending entity and responsible natural persons, and shall not impose collective punishment on non-culpable employees, customers, or shareholders.

Section 6. Digital Commons Compliance

(a) Constitutional Obligation
Any corporation that develops, maintains, controls, or licenses software, hardware, data systems, or technical infrastructure subject to Article X shall comply with abandonment, sunset, and convergence requirements; preserve and disclose all code and design iterations upon trigger; and cooperate with lawful archival and public access. Terms including ‘abandonment,’ ‘sunset,’ and ‘convergence’ shall have the meanings set forth in Article X.

(b) License Warfare Prohibited
The use of licensing schemes, shell entities, legal fragmentation, or ideological barriers to prevent lawful reuse of mature knowledge after lawful convergence trigger constitutes hostile conduct against the Republic. Findings of hostile conduct under this Section shall require determination by the Constitutional Review Court based on technical evidence and material obstruction of lawful convergence.

Section 7. Periodic Charter Review and Mission Lock

(a) Periodic Charter Review
Corporations exceeding thresholds defined by law shall undergo periodic charter review every twenty-five (25) years to demonstrate ongoing productive purpose and public benefit. Charter review shall be evidence-based, non-ideological, and limited to evaluation of stated productive purpose, public harm, and material compliance, and shall not be used to punish lawful dissent or unpopular speech.

(b) Founder Mission Lock
Founders may embed an irrevocable productive mission statement in the corporate charter. Courts shall consider this mission in veil-piercing, dissolution, or grave offense proceedings.

(c) Anti-Crony Certification
Corporations receiving federal contracts, subsidies, bailouts, or emergency aid must certify no political donations or lobbying in the prior five (5) years. 
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall audit and certify compliance with this subsection and may refer violations to the Constitutional Review Court for remedies under Section 5.

(d) Open-Source After Subsidy
Technology developed with public funds or tax privileges must open-source non-core intellectual property after fifteen (15) years or patent expiration, whichever comes first.

(e) Innovation Monopoly Carve-Out
Temporary protection from certain anti-monopoly rules may be granted to corporations that create entirely new markets through genuine innovation. ‘Genuine innovation’ requires demonstrable creation of new productive capacity, not merely financial engineering, regulatory arbitrage, or control of existing markets.

Section 8. Prohibition on Reconstruction and Conquest Profiteering

(a) No Profit from War or Collapse
No corporation, consortium, financial instrument, or private actor may profit from military conquest, post-war reconstruction, regime collapse, sanctions-induced scarcity, or humanitarian crises caused or exacerbated by state action.

(b) Ban on Preferential Contracting
No corporation may receive preferential contracts or exclusive rights in territories subject to military intervention or post-conflict rebuilding arising from prior lobbying or political coordination.

(c) Public-Interest Reconstruction Only
All reconstruction efforts shall prioritize civilian welfare, essential infrastructure, and transparent contracting.

(d) Criminal Liability
Any corporation or natural person who advocates for war for private gain, engineers instability for profit, or exploits conquest to extract wealth commits a grave offense against the Republic. Liability requires material advocacy, coordination, or action that foreseeably contributed to conflict or exploitation, not mere expression of opinion absent causal nexus.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to investigate coordination, lobbying, or financial engineering intended to provoke or exploit conflict and to refer such findings to the Constitutional Review Court.

Section 9. Limits and Protections

(a) Protection of Legitimate Enterprise
This Article shall not be interpreted to punish lawful success, discourage productive enterprise, prohibit scale achieved through value creation, interfere with honest competition, or suppress lawful dissent or innovation.

(b) Due Process
All actions under this Article require notice, evidence, judicial review, and proportional remedies. No corporation shall be condemned by accusation alone.

Section 10. Interpretation
This Article shall be interpreted to ensure that economic power remains the servant of human dignity, national sovereignty, and truth. When private power becomes unaccountable, liberty dies. Therefore, the Republic reserves the right to revoke the privileges it grants.

Article XVII — Definitions and Construction
	•	Corporation includes any for-profit or nonprofit legal entity recognized by law.
	•	Beneficial ownership means direct or indirect control, equity, or decision-making power.
	•	Grave offense means conduct defined in Section 4 meeting the mens rea requirements herein.
	•	Enemy of the Republic means designation under Section 5(d).
	•	Crime tiers, evidentiary standards, and penalties are governed by Article VII.
	•	Digital commons terms are governed by Article X.
	•	Rules of constitutional interpretation are governed by Article XIX.
	•	Courts shall evaluate substance over form and require notice, evidence, judicial findings, and proportionality before sanctions.

As it is written: “You cannot serve both God and Mammon.”

Article XVIII — Civic Formation, Education, and the Preservation of the Republic

Charge

This Article establishes constitutional principles governing civic formation and education within the Republic for the purpose of sustaining democratic self-government. All educational and civic institutions operating under public authority shall be construed to promote independent reasoning, historical understanding, lawful civic participation, and respect for constitutional order. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to authorize ideological compulsion, partisan indoctrination, or the use of education as an instrument of political conformity or administrative control.

a. rational thought and evidence-based judgment;
b. ethical reasoning and moral responsibility;
c. understanding the structure, history, and limits of government;

e. peaceful debate, lawful dissent, and civic participation;
f. lawful self-defense and defense of the innocent.

No educational system shall be oriented toward ideological conformity, partisan allegiance, or administrative obedience.

Section 2. Methods of Instruction

Instruction shall emphasize:

a. inquiry over indoctrination;
b. dialogue, debate, and cross-examination over rote memorization;

Section 3. Historical and Constitutional Literacy

Education shall include rigorous instruction in:

a. the history of the Republic and its founding principles;
b. comparative political systems and their failures;
c. the causes of tyranny, collapse, and corruption in past civilizations;
d. the structure, powers, and limits of each branch of government;

a. argue from evidence rather than authority;
b. recognize logical fallacies, emotional manipulation, and rhetorical coercion;
c. engage opposing views in good faith;

b. public deliberation;
c. emergency response and civil defense;
d. lawful resistance to tyranny.

Nothing in this Section shall compel ideological conformity or mandatory service, but the Republic may incentivize civic education and preparedness consistent with liberty.

Section 7. Protection Against Educational Capture

No educational institution receiving public funds may:

a. operate as a vehicle for partisan political advocacy;
b. condition advancement on ideological affirmation;
c. suppress lawful speech or inquiry;
d. impose collective guilt or privilege based on immutable characteristics;
e. subordinate competence to political criteria.

Violations of this Section are subject to judicial review and loss of public funding.
Section 7-A. Curricular Transparency and Provenance

All curricular standards, instructional frameworks, approved materials lists, textbook adoption decisions, educator training guidance issued or funded under public authority, and assessment rubrics that materially influence public instruction shall be treated as public records.

Such materials shall be proactively published in accessible, searchable form, including authorship or sponsoring bodies, dates of issuance and revision, stated objectives, and a public change-log sufficient to identify substantive edits across versions.

No public educational authority may rely upon opacity, outsourcing, or contractor status to evade disclosure, provenance, or accountability for materials used in publicly funded instruction.
Section 7-B. No Ideological Tests by Accreditation, Framework, or Proxy

No educational institution receiving public funds, and no accreditor or standards body exercising public authority or determining eligibility for public funds, shall condition admission, grading, credentialing, employment, or advancement on ideological affirmation, compelled belief, compelled political speech, or viewpoint conformity.

No institution shall launder prohibited compulsion or suppression through “standards,” “best practices,” “equity frameworks,” “professional norms,” or similar instruments where the practical effect is ideological enforcement rather than competence-based evaluation.
Section 7-C. Enforcement, Standing, and Remedy

Violations of Sections 7, 7-A, or 7-B are subject to expedited judicial review. Standing shall be afforded to students, parents or guardians, educators, and taxpayers as provided by law.

Courts may order disclosure, enjoin enforcement of unlawful requirements, and impose proportionate funding consequences for institutions that persist in prohibited practices after notice and opportunity to cure.

Section 8. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to favor:

a. intellectual independence over conformity;
b. competence over credentials;
c. courage over compliance;
d. truth over narrative;
e. civic strength over passive dependence.

The Republic entrusts its future not to managed populations, but to educated, capable, and free persons.

Section 9. Mentorship, Aptitude, and Developmental Pluralism
 
(patched)

The Republic recognizes that human excellence arises through diverse paths of development and that individuals possess varied aptitudes, temperaments, and talents.

Education and civic formation shall therefore:

a. encourage mentorship, apprenticeship, and guided mastery to cultivate natural gifts in science, engineering, medicine, craftsmanship, art, philosophy, and other fields essential to civilization;
b. support intensive, structured educational paths for those who benefit from high expectation, discipline, and close guidance;
c. protect exploratory, self-directed, and experiential learning for those who mature through autonomy, play, and discovery.

Parents and guardians retain primary authority to guide the upbringing and educational path of their children, consistent with the safety, dignity, and rights of the child.

No single model of childhood, parenting, or development shall be imposed by the state. The Republic shall neither penalize ambition nor suppress independence where both are exercised lawfully and without harm.

Public institutions shall accommodate varied developmental approaches, provided that core civic competencies, literacy, numeracy, physical health, and constitutional understanding are achieved.

The Republic shall provide targeted, non-coercive support—including grants, scholarships, and digital resources—to ensure equitable access to mentorship, apprenticeships, and alternative educational paths for families of limited means.

Section 10. Parental Stewardship and the Rights of the Child

Parents and guardians are the primary stewards of their children’s upbringing and education and bear an affirmative duty to support their intellectual, moral, physical, and civic development.

The Republic recognizes the family as the first school of citizenship and shall protect the right of parents to participate meaningfully in their children’s education.

No parent or guardian may willfully obstruct, sabotage, or deny a child access to basic education, literacy, numeracy, physical health, civic knowledge, or opportunities necessary for independent adulthood.

A child shall not be deprived of education, development, or future opportunity by reason of parental ideology, neglect, coercion, exploitation, or deliberate isolation from lawful civic life.

Where credible evidence demonstrates persistent, material deprivation—defined as demonstrable harm to literacy, numeracy, civic knowledge, or physical well-being following documented notice and reasonable opportunity to remedy deficiencies—the Republic may intervene solely to secure the child’s access to education and opportunity, using the least intrusive means consistent with the child’s welfare and family integrity.

Intervention shall be corrective and restorative, not punitive, and shall never be used to impose ideological conformity.

Section 11. Qualification of Home, Alternative, and Religious Education

All forms of education—including public, private, home-based, alternative, vocational, and religious institutions—shall be permitted and protected, provided they meet the minimum civic requirements of the Republic.

Qualification shall be determined solely by demonstrated outcomes, including:

a. literacy and numeracy sufficient for independent adult life;
b. basic scientific and historical understanding grounded in evidence and primary sources;
c. knowledge of the structure, rights, and duties of the Republic;
d. development of reasoning, inquiry, and lawful civic participation;
e. protection of the child’s physical safety, health, and dignity.

Evaluations shall be conducted by independent, accredited third-party assessors or voluntary educational consortia, operating transparently and subject to judicial review for neutrality and fairness. No single governmental authority may monopolize qualification or assessment. Families and institutions shall have the right to select among qualified evaluators.

No educational path shall be disqualified on the basis of belief, pedagogy, culture, or philosophy where these standards are met.

Failure to meet standards shall result in corrective support and reasonable opportunity to remedy deficiencies. Persistent, willful refusal may trigger limited intervention under Section 10 solely to secure the child’s access to education.


Section 12. Prohibition on Commandeering
 The federal government may not commandeer state officials, legislatures, or resources to enforce, administer, or implement federal regulatory programs, including by requiring states to enact or enforce federal laws, regulate in a particular manner, or bear the costs of federal mandates without consent. Any such attempt is void ab initio and constitutes a grave offense against the Republic. (Cross-references: Article VII on grave offenses; Article XV anti-emergency drift).



Section 13. Limits on Federal Preemption
 Federal preemption (as defined in Article 0) shall occur only when expressly stated in a statute enacted pursuant to an enumerated power, or when federal law directly conflicts with state law in a manner impossible to reconcile. Implied field preemption or obstacle preemption shall be disfavored and applied only upon clear and convincing evidence of congressional intent to occupy the entire field. States retain concurrent authority in areas of traditional state police power (e.g., health, safety, morals, education, land use) absent explicit federal displacement.



Section 14. Prohibition on Fiscal Coercion
 Fiscal coercion (as defined in Article 0) is prohibited. The federal government may not condition funding, grants, or benefits on state adoption of federal policies, compliance with unfunded mandates, or waiver of reserved powers in a manner that creates unconstitutional dependency or compulsion. Conditional funding must be genuinely related to the federal interest, proportionate, and non-coercive. Any attempt to use appropriations as a tool to circumvent state sovereignty is void and subject to judicial invalidation and civil liability.



Section 15. Lock Designation

This Article (including all provisions on reserved powers, anti-commandeering, preemption limits, and fiscal coercion prohibitions) is hereby designated as lock-protected pursuant to Article XV. No amendment, statute, emergency declaration, or judicial doctrine may dilute these protections except by the highest procedural threshold and certification of non-diminishment.

Article XVIII-A — Higher Education Accountability and Non-Predatory Financing

Charge

This Article establishes constitutional requirements governing the financing, pricing, disclosure, and accountability of higher education institutions operating within the Republic. Academic freedom in teaching, inquiry, and expression shall be preserved, while financial practices that impose deceptive costs, disproportionate debt burdens, or long-term dependency without commensurate educational value are prohibited. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to restrict lawful fields of study or expression, provided that educational offerings are financed, disclosed, and administered in a manner consistent with constitutional safeguards against exploitation.

Section 1. Academic Freedom Preserved

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to prohibit or suppress any lawful field of study, inquiry, or expression, including theoretical, artistic, philosophical, or social disciplines.

Institutions may offer non-remunerative or low-remunerative programs, provided such programs are priced, disclosed, and financed in a manner consistent with this Article.

⸻

Section 2. Prohibition on Predatory Educational Debt

No educational institution, public or private, may knowingly induce, facilitate, or rely upon debt financing that:

(a) is grossly disproportionate to the demonstrated economic or vocational payoff of the instruction provided;
(b) would reasonably be expected to impose long-term financial incapacity, dependency, or insolvency upon the student absent extraordinary fortune;
(c) relies upon misleading representations, selective statistics, or omission of material outcome data.

For purposes of this Article, “educational institution” includes any entity that offers instruction, training, certification, or credentialing in exchange for compensation, regardless of degree-granting status, accreditation label, or marketing designation.

Debt incurred for education shall not be exempt from any constitutional debt limitation, discharge provision, or jubilee established by this Constitution.

⸻

Section 3. Mandatory Outcome Disclosure and Informed Consent

Prior to enrollment, institutions offering instruction above a defined cost threshold shall provide clear, standardized disclosure of:

(a) median earnings of graduates at five (5), ten (10), and twenty (20) years;
(b) typical debt burdens and repayment outcomes;
(c) variance and distribution of outcomes, not merely averages;
(d) historical rates of default or non-completion.

For programs not reasonably expected to yield substantial financial return, institutions shall obtain a written acknowledgment from the student affirming understanding that the program is pursued primarily for non-economic reasons and is priced accordingly.

Failure to provide accurate disclosure shall render associated debt presumptively unenforceable.

⸻

Section 4. Separation of Education from State-Issued Debt

The Republic shall not maintain a general system of state-issued student loans.

Nothing in this Section shall prohibit:

(a) private lending subject to constitutional debt laws and remedies;
(b) voluntary, informed private financing without state guarantee;
(c) repayment-free public grants as provided in Section 5.

The absence of state-issued loans shall not be construed to relieve institutions of compliance with this Article.

⸻

Section 5. Public Grants and Non-Debt Support

The Republic may fund higher education through non-repayable grants, scholarships, or stipends, financed exclusively from:

(a) net proceeds derived from currency issuance or monetary operations;
(b) unspent, lapsed, or surplus public funds;
(c) other non-debt public revenues authorized by law.

Such grants shall prioritize:

(a) fields essential to civic continuity, public safety, health, infrastructure, science, and education;
(b) affordability and broad access without credential inflation;
(c) institutions and programs that demonstrate cost discipline and transparency.

No grant program shall be used to subsidize inflated tuition, administrative bloat, or institutional rent-seeking.

⸻

Section 6. Prohibition on Credential Arbitrage and Degree Inflation

No institution may structure academic programs primarily to:

(a) maximize debt extraction through stacked credentials;
(b) impose unnecessary degree requirements unrelated to demonstrated competence;
(c) gate access to lawful employment through artificial credential escalation.

Courts and regulators shall construe ambiguity in favor of substance over credential and against financial extraction disguised as academic necessity.

⸻

Section 7. Enforcement and Remedies

Students and graduates shall have standing to challenge violations of this Article.

Courts may:

(a) void or reduce unenforceable educational debt;
(b) impose restitution or penalties for deceptive practices;
(c) enjoin predatory pricing or financing schemes.

No immunity, accreditation status, or institutional prestige shall bar enforcement.

⸻

Section 8. Construction

This Article shall be construed to:

(a) protect academic freedom and pluralism of inquiry;
(b) prevent financial exploitation and asymmetric deception;
(c) preserve voluntary risk-taking where informed and proportionate;
(d) discourage dependence on debt as a substitute for value.

⸻

Article XIX — Public Symbols, Monuments, and Civic Art

Charge

This Article establishes constitutional principles governing the creation, display, maintenance, alteration, and removal of public symbols, monuments, and civic art under public authority. All such actions shall be conducted pursuant to lawful, transparent, and procedurally fair processes designed to ensure historical accuracy, public accountability, and equal treatment without ideological preference or partisan advantage. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to authorize arbitrary erasure, compelled endorsement, or unilateral executive action affecting public symbols absent authority and due process provided by law.

Legal Text

Section 1. Purpose and Scope

Public symbols, monuments, memorials, statues, murals, flags, seals, architectural features, and civic art placed or maintained by public authority exist to:

a. commemorate history truthfully;
b. honor sacrifice, service, and excellence;
c. transmit shared civic values;
d. elevate public spaces through beauty, meaning, and dignity.

This Article governs all such works funded, commissioned, displayed, maintained, or endorsed by public institutions at any level of government, including those on federal, state, or local property.

It applies to both permanent installations and those that become de facto permanent through prolonged display.

Section 2. Truthful Representation of History

Public monuments and symbols shall not falsify, sanitize, or deliberately distort historical truth.

Historical commemoration shall acknowledge complexity, including achievement and failure, heroism and wrongdoing, without propagandistic erasure or retroactive moral absolutism.

Where historical interpretation evolves with new evidence or scholarly consensus, contextualization—such as explanatory plaques, adjacent interpretive materials, or digital supplements—may be added.

Destruction, removal, concealment, or alteration shall not be the default remedy and requires the process set forth in Section 4.

Section 3. Prohibition of Tyrannical Glorification

No public symbol or monument shall glorify:

a. tyranny, totalitarianism, or mass atrocity;
b. regimes or movements dedicated to racial supremacy, ideological extermination, or the abolition of human dignity;
c. individuals whose primary legacy consists of crimes against humanity or deliberate destruction of the Republic.

This prohibition shall be applied narrowly and with evidentiary rigor, based on historical consensus and judicial findings, not ideological fashion or transient political pressure.

For purposes of this Section, historical consensus shall be demonstrated by a convergence of peer-reviewed scholarship, judicial findings, and primary historical evidence. Executive declaration, administrative guidance, or political resolution alone shall not constitute consensus.

Section 4. Protection of Lawful Historical Monuments — Removal, Alteration, and Restoration Process

No public monument, memorial, or civic artwork may be removed, destroyed, defaced, concealed, altered, or restored except through lawful process.

Such process shall require:

a. public notice and full disclosure of proposed changes, including historical rationale;
b. recorded deliberation by the appropriate governing body (local, state, or federal as applicable);
c. opportunity for public testimony and expert input;
d. a supermajority vote of two-thirds (⅔) of the full authorized membership of the governing body where the action is permanent;
e. judicial review for compliance with this Article upon challenge by any Civic Citizen or affected party.

Emergency removal or temporary protective measures shall be permitted only to prevent imminent physical harm or genuine public safety threats, with mandatory review and restoration consideration within ninety (90) days.

Where a monument has been unlawfully removed, altered, or concealed in violation of this Article or prior law, a symmetric supermajority process with identical procedural safeguards may order its restoration or rectification.

Section 5. Civic Art and Public Commissioning

Publicly commissioned art shall be selected through transparent processes emphasizing:

a. artistic merit and craftsmanship;
b. durability and suitability for public space;
c. contribution to civic dignity rather than provocation, nihilism, or partisan division;
d. respect for shared civic inheritance.

Public art shall not be used as a vehicle for partisan messaging, ideological coercion, or contempt for the People who fund and inhabit public spaces.

Selection processes shall be open, recorded, and subject to public oversight.

Section 6. Pluralism Without Fragmentation

The Republic affirms that its people arise from many traditions and inheritances.

Public symbols may reflect diverse contributions to the national story, provided such representation:

a. reinforces shared civic identity;
b. does not elevate subgroup identity above constitutional unity;
c. does not promote grievance as a civic virtue.

Pluralism shall strengthen cohesion, not replace it.

Section 7. Local Stewardship and Federal Restraint

Primary authority over public symbols and monuments rests with local and state governments, subject to the constraints of this Constitution.

The federal government shall not mandate removal, alteration, installation, or restoration of public symbols absent constitutional necessity or express statutory authorization consistent with Article XXVIII (Federalization of Sovereign Authority).

Federal funding shall not be conditioned upon ideological conformity in civic symbolism, nor withheld punitively for lawful state or local decisions regarding monuments or civic art.

Section 8. Cultural Heritage and Preservation

The Republic recognizes cultural, artistic, and architectural heritage as a form of national wealth.

Historic preservation, restoration, and conservation shall be encouraged as acts of stewardship.

Destruction motivated by political fashion, factional pressure, moral panic, or claims of necessity is prohibited.

Private philanthropy and voluntary maintenance may supplement public efforts, provided they comply with this Article and do not circumvent lawful process.

Section 9. Temporary Displays and Protest Expression

Temporary displays, protest art, or expressive installations shall be governed by content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions consistent with Article II (Rights, Liberties, and Personal Sovereignty).

Temporary expression shall not acquire permanent public status absent lawful commissioning and review under Section 5.

De facto permanence through neglect, administrative inaction, or political favoritism shall trigger mandatory review and either removal or formalization through lawful process.

Section 10. Protection Against Iconoclasm and Symbolic Vandalism

Willful destruction, defacement, or desecration of public monuments and civic art constitutes an offense against the Republic and shall be punishable as a crime under Article VII (Crime, Justice, and Penal Philosophy), with penalties scaled to severity of harm and intent.

No person shall be retroactively criminally liable for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, except where already prohibited by general criminal law.

Peaceful criticism, contextual critique, lawful advocacy for change, and non-destructive protest remain fully protected under Article II.

Section 11. No Aesthetic Central Planning

Nothing in this Article authorizes the state to impose a single artistic style, canon, or aesthetic doctrine.

Civic art shall emerge from excellence, craftsmanship, and meaning, not bureaucratic mandate or centralized ideological direction.

Section 12. Remedies, Enforcement, and Standing

Any Civic Citizen, lawful resident, or state with standing may challenge violations of this Article in court.

Remedies for unlawful actions include injunction, restoration, damages, and disgorgement of misused public funds.

Qualified immunity shall not shield intentional violations of this Article.

Enforcement shall align with Article XI (Transparency, Anti-Capture, and Public Stewardship) with respect to records access, disclosure, and accountability.

Section 13. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to favor:

a. truth over propaganda;
b. stewardship over erasure;
c. unity over faction;
d. dignity over shock;
e. continuity over ideological churn;
f. lawful process over unilateral action, whether for removal or restoration.

The Republic shall remember who it is, where it came from, and what it owes to those who came before—through honest commemoration, not selective forgetting or imposed revision.


Article II — Rights, Liberties, And Personal Sovereignty

Charge
This Article defines the legal status, duties, and protections of citizenship and allegiance within the Republic. Citizenship shall constitute a binding legal relationship governed by reciprocal rights and obligations. Allegiance to the Republic shall be exclusive, voluntary, and enforceable as provided by law. All statutes and administrative actions under this Article shall be construed to preserve national sovereignty, civic responsibility, and equal application of the law.

Section 0. Constitutional Construction, Supremacy, and Enforcement

(a) Self-Executing Rights

All rights secured by this Article are self-executing, immediately enforceable, and binding upon all branches, officers, courts, agencies, contractors, and instrumentalities of the Republic, federal, state, and subordinate alike.

No implementing legislation, appropriation, rulemaking, or administrative action shall be required for their effect, and no authority may delay, condition, narrow, suspend, or ration their enforcement absent express authorization in this Constitution.

No emergency, national security declaration, treaty, or international obligation shall suspend or override the operation of this Article.

(b) Interpretive Supremacy

This Article shall be construed in harmony with Article 0 (Global Definitions and Rules of Interpretation) and Article XXVI (Charter of Inviolable Rights).

Where any ambiguity, silence, conflict, or tension exists, interpretation shall favor the maximum preservation of individual liberty, bodily integrity, conscience, privacy, due process, and freedom from coercion.

No inference of governmental power shall be drawn from silence, implication, tradition, or historical practice.

(c) Prohibition on Judicial Balancing and Deference

No court shall subject the rights secured by this Article to ad hoc balancing tests, interest-weighing frameworks, rational-basis review, intermediate scrutiny, cost–benefit analysis, claims of administrative convenience, asserted expertise, national security, emergency declarations, or institutional deference, except where this Constitution expressly and unambiguously so permits.

No doctrine of “political question,” “deference,” “standing,” “ripeness,” “qualified immunity,” “sovereign immunity,” or “harmless error” may be used to avoid enforcement of these rights.

(d) Burden of Justification

Where this Article permits restraint of liberty, the burden of proof rests entirely upon the government.

Such restraint shall be upheld only upon clear and convincing evidence, narrowly tailored to a compelling and lawful constitutional purpose, and employing the least restrictive means available.

Economic convenience, administrative efficiency, political expedience, public opinion, or institutional preference shall not constitute compelling interest.

(e) Anti-Evasion Rule

No authority may evade the protections of this Article by reclassification, relabeling, indirect structuring, delegation, outsourcing, privatization, or Pretextual Coercion (as defined in Article 0), including but not limited to characterizing restraints as civil, administrative, medical, regulatory, protective, preventive, or non-punitive where their effect burdens liberty, bodily autonomy, movement, conscience, speech, association, or due process.

Private actors acting under color of law, contract, license, delegation, algorithmic enforcement, or regulatory compulsion shall be treated as state actors for purposes of this Article.

(f) Voidness of Contrary Law or Judgment

Any statute, regulation, executive action, policy, treaty, international agreement, judicial doctrine, or judgment inconsistent with this Article is void to the extent of the conflict and shall be denied force or effect.

Courts shall provide immediate relief, including injunction, suppression of evidence, dismissal, and damages, to any person whose rights under this Article are violated.

Section 1. Fundamental Liberties of Thought, Expression, and Association

All lawful residents possess inherent liberties which may be limited only through due process, and only where necessary to protect life, dignity, or public safety. No limitation may be imposed for political, ideological, administrative, economic, or reputational convenience.

These liberties include:

(a) freedom of conscience, belief, disbelief, inquiry, conversion, and religious practice;
(b) freedom of speech, expression, writing, art, press, and symbolic communication;
(c) freedom of peaceful assembly and association;
(d) freedom of movement within the Republic;
(e) freedom from arbitrary arrest, coercion, or detention;
(f) freedom from involuntary medical treatment except through lawful due process;
(g) freedom from forced labor except as lawful punishment after conviction.

No government entity may abridge or compel these freedoms except as expressly permitted herein. No private entity acting under contract, license, regulation, or coercion of the state may do so on its behalf.

Section 1A. Judicial Duty, Timely Review, and Relief

(a) Non-Discretionary Jurisdiction
No court may decline, postpone, abstain from, or refuse to adjudicate a claim alleging violation of this Article on grounds of standing limitation, ripeness, mootness, political question, institutional competence, docket congestion, comity, or prudential discretion. No claim may be dismissed or delayed due to treaty, national security, or emergency declaration.

(b) Expedited Review Requirement
Claims alleging deprivation of liberty, bodily autonomy, detention, search, seizure, compelled treatment, or suppression of expression under this Article shall receive expedited judicial review as follows:
	•	Initial judicial hearing — within 24 hours of filing or detention, whichever occurs first;
	•	Written findings on legality — within 72 hours of the hearing;
	•	Final determination — within 7 days, absent extraordinary circumstances expressly found on the record.

(c) Habeas and Custodial Claims
Any person restrained of liberty shall be entitled to immediate habeas review. Failure to provide judicial review within the timelines specified herein shall result in automatic interim release, subject only to conditions strictly necessary to prevent imminent and specific harm.

(d) Search and Seizure Challenges
Motions challenging searches, seizures, or data access under this Article shall be heard within 5 days of filing. Evidence obtained or retained without timely judicial validation shall be suppressed unless expressly admissible under Section 2 of this Article.

(e) Prohibition on Indefinite Stay
No stay, injunction, or deferral of relief may extend beyond 14 days unless affirmed by a higher court with written findings demonstrating constitutional necessity. Serial or rolling stays are prohibited.

(f) Automatic Relief for Delay
Where a court or authority fails to act within the timelines required by this Section, the claimant shall be entitled to immediate interim relief, including suppression of evidence, release from restraint, or compelled disclosure, pending final adjudication.

(g) Personal Accountability
Knowing or reckless failure by any judge, official, or officer to comply with the duties imposed by this Section constitutes constitutional misconduct and shall subject the responsible party to discipline, removal, and liability as provided elsewhere in this Constitution.

Section 1B. Standing, Justiciability, and Access
(a) Guaranteed Standing
Any person alleging a violation or credible threat of violation of this Article shall have standing to sue. No showing of special injury, exhaustion of remedies, exhaustion of administrative process, or prior denial shall be required.

(b) Credible Threat Standard
Standing exists where a policy, practice, regulation, directive, or pattern of conduct creates a reasonable likelihood of future violation. Persons need not await arrest, detention, punishment, or harm to seek relief.

(c) Prohibition on Standing Doctrines as Barriers
No court may deny standing, dismiss a claim, or limit relief under doctrines of generalized grievance, third-party standing, taxpayer standing, prudential limitation, or similar judicially created barriers.

(d) Associational Standing
Organizations may bring suit on behalf of affected persons where such persons face practical barriers to litigation or risk retaliation, intimidation, or suppression.

Section 1C. Individual Accountability

(a) No Immunity for Constitutional Violations
No officer, employee, contractor, agent, or delegate of the Republic shall enjoy immunity—qualified, absolute, sovereign, official, or otherwise—for knowing, reckless, or negligent violations of this Article.

(b) Color of Law Defined Broadly
Liability attaches to any person acting under color of law, authority, delegation, contract, or de facto power, regardless of formal employment or organizational status.

(c) Supervisory and Systemic Liability
Supervisors, policymakers, and commanding officials are liable where violations result from policy, training failure, tolerated practice, willful blindness, or systemic design.

(d) No Defense of Orders or Automation
Superior orders, institutional policy, emergency declaration, algorithmic mediation, or automated decision systems shall not excuse liability nor shall treaty obligation, international law, or intergovernmental agreement.

Section 1D. Remedies

(a) Mandatory Relief
Upon a finding of violation, courts shall grant effective relief sufficient to terminate the violation, prevent recurrence, and restore the injured party as nearly as possible to their prior position.

(b) Available Remedies Include
Relief shall include, as appropriate:
	•	declaratory judgment;
	•	injunctive relief;
	•	suppression or exclusion of evidence;
	•	release from detention or restraint;
	•	rescission of unlawful orders or policies;
	•	restoration of rights, licenses, status, or property;
	•	compensatory damages;
	•	statutory damages where quantification is impracticable.

(c) No Harmless-Error Escape
Violations of this Article shall not be excused as harmless where they burden liberty, bodily autonomy, privacy, due process, or expressive freedom nor may courts decline relief on grounds that the outcome would have been the same.

(d) Structural Injunctions Permitted
Where violations arise from policy, practice, or system design, courts may order structural remedies narrowly tailored to achieve compliance.

Section 1E. Attorney Fees and Costs

(a) Fee-Shifting Mandated
Any prevailing claimant under this Article shall be awarded reasonable attorney fees, expert costs, and litigation expenses.

(b) Government Pays
Fees and damages shall be paid by the offending agency or authority, not from the personal recovery of the injured party.

(c) Personal Contribution Permitted
Where a violation is knowing or reckless, courts may order partial personal contribution by responsible officials.

(d) No Bond or Security Requirement
No claimant enforcing this Article shall be required to post bond or security as a condition of injunctive or declaratory relief.

Section 2. Privacy, Data Integrity, and Search Protections

All persons possess the right to privacy, encryption, and security against unreasonable search and seizure. No person may be compelled to decrypt, disclose, or provide passwords, cryptographic keys, biometric identifiers, or authentication credentials to access their data, except through a warrant issued upon probable cause for a specific device or account.

(a) Lawful Access

Searches of data, property, or communications require a judicial warrant supported by evidence. 
No search or surveillance may be conducted under foreign intelligence, national security, counterterrorism, or treaty authority without full compliance with this Section.
Such warrants shall be particularized to the person, place, account, or device to be searched and shall not authorize bulk collection, general warrants, dragnet surveillance, or exploratory data fishing.
Illegally obtained evidence is admissible only for heinous crimes, including murder, rape, molestation, trafficking, exploitation, or comparable offenses.
Officers who unlawfully obtain such evidence shall be prosecuted separately.
No derivative evidence, intelligence, or investigative lead obtained through unlawful access may be admitted, used, or retained, except under the heinous-crime exception of this Section.
(b) Proportionality

Intrusions must be narrowly tailored, evidence-based, and proportionate to the threat posed, and shall never be used for political, ideological, or personal retribution.

(c) Lesser Offenses
For non-heinous crimes, unlawfully obtained evidence shall be excluded.
(d) Evidentiary Classification Lock
The classification of an offense as heinous or non-heinous for purposes of admissibility under this Section shall be governed exclusively by the definitions set forth in Article VII.
No court may expand, contract, or analogize such classification beyond the express constitutional text.
No secret court, classified tribunal, or special national security body may alter or override this classification.


Section 2A. Limits on Detention and Apprehension

(a) Presumption of Liberty
All persons are presumed free. Any detention, apprehension, confinement, or restraint of movement constitutes a deprivation of liberty and shall be treated as such regardless of label or asserted purpose.

(b) Judicial Authorization Required
No person may be detained or apprehended absent a judicial warrant or order supported by sworn evidence establishing individualized probable cause of a crime or, where expressly permitted, imminent and specific risk of serious harm.
Detention may not be justified solely by immigration status, material-witness designation, risk of flight, or administrative convenience.

(c) Temporary Emergency Holds
	•	Temporary, non-consensual holds ... may occur only where: 
	•	an Imminent and Specific Risk of serious harm (as defined in Article 0) is present; 
	•	no less restrictive means are reasonably available;
	•	the hold is strictly time-limited and non-punitive; and
	•	judicial review is obtained within 24 hours.

(d) Maximum Duration
Absent criminal charge or express constitutional authorization, no non-consensual hold may exceed 72 hours. Continued restraint beyond that period requires a formal judicial order issued after an adversarial hearing.  Successive or renewed holds based on the same or substantially similar facts are prohibited.

(e) Prohibition on Preventive Detention by Reclassification
No authority may impose detention or restraint by recharacterizing it as civil commitment, protective custody, public health measure, administrative hold, welfare intervention, psychiatric diagnosis, behavioral assessment, algorithmic risk scoring, or similar designation where the effect is deprivation of liberty.

(f) Automatic Release for Noncompliance
Failure to meet the requirements of this Section results in immediate release and bars re-detention on the same factual basis absent materially new evidence.
No person released under this Section may be transferred, deported, or surrendered to any foreign or private authority for the purpose of continuing the same detention.

Section 3 — Defense, Arms, and Civic Responsibility

The right of the People to keep, bear, acquire, manufacture, modify, possess, and carry arms for lawful defense of self, others, community, and the Republic is inherent, fundamental, and shall not be infringed.

This right exists prior to the state and is necessary to preserve liberty, deter tyranny, resist invasion, suppress criminal violence, and secure the continuity of constitutional order.

(a) Arms as a Civic Right and Duty

The defense of the Republic is a shared civic responsibility.
The People shall not be disarmed, rendered dependent, or left defenseless.

The exercise of the right to arms includes:
• individual self-defense,
• mutual defense,
• community protection,
• resistance to unlawful force,
• and defense against foreign or domestic enemies.

The Republic shall maintain a broadly armed and trained population sufficient to deter invasion, subversion, mass violence, and tyranny.

(b) Voluntary Arms Guilds and Mutual Accountability

To promote safety, training, coordination, and accountability, the People have the right to organize, join, and operate arms guilds, including:

• militia units,
• certified gun clubs,
• hunting or sporting associations,
• private security cooperatives,
• neighborhood defense associations,
• or equivalent lawful defensive organizations.

These associations exist to:
• provide training and certification,
• encourage safe handling and storage,
• promote ethical defensive use,
• and provide mutual accountability.

Membership in such organizations shall never be a condition of exercising the right to keep and bear arms.

If the state fails to support, recognize, or protect lawful arms guilds, or if such organizations become inaccessible, suppressed, or captured, the right to individual arms ownership and carry remains fully operative and unimpaired.

No government action or inaction may be used to convert this right into a privilege.

(c) Background Exclusions (Narrow and Temporary)

Restrictions on arms possession may exclude only:

• persons convicted of Tier Three (grave) offenses,
• repeat violent offenders,
• persons currently meeting the definition of Severe, Dangerous Mental Illness under Article 0, based on clear and convincing evidence and two independent evaluations,
• or persons with verified operational ties to enemies of the Republic.

All exclusions based on mental or behavioral condition:
• shall be temporary,
• shall be subject to periodic judicial review,
• and shall include a clear and mandatory restoration pathway upon cessation of qualifying risk.

No permanent disability may be imposed without full due process under Section 5.

(d) Training, Education, and Public Competence

The People have a constitutional right to learn the safe, effective, and ethical use of arms.

The public education system shall include age-appropriate, opt-out-capable instruction in:
• firearm safety,
• lawful self-defense,
• emergency response,
• and civic defense.

Training may be required only for weapons requiring advanced technical skill, not as a precondition for ordinary possession or carry.

No lack of training, income, or institutional access may be used to deny the right of defense.

(e) Weapons of Extreme Mass Destruction

Weapons whose inherent nature makes proportionate, discriminating, or containable use impossible are prohibited without exception, including:

• nuclear weapons,
• radiological weapons,
• biological weapons,
• uncontrollable chemical agents,
• and devices whose foreseeable effects would cause indiscriminate mass death or irreversible ecological devastation.

No other class of arms may be prohibited.

There shall be no bans on:
• ammunition,
• magazine capacity,
• calibers,
• assistive devices,
• optics,
• stabilizers,
• suppressors,
• or lawful modifications.

(f) Robotics, Autonomous Systems, and Advanced Platforms

Robotic, autonomous, cyber-physical, or intelligent systems are not weapons per se.

Where such systems are configured or deployed as platforms for lethal or coercive force, they shall be regulated as arms platforms in proportion to:

• lethality,
• autonomy,
• range,
• and capacity for harm,

with requirements including:
	•	human command responsibility,
	•	licensing proportional to destructive potential,
	•	training and certification,
	•	traceable ownership,
	•	and full civil and criminal liability for misuse.

No autonomous system shall be deemed a weapon of mass destruction unless its payload or intended use independently meets that definition.

(g) Stand-Your-Ground and Good-Faith Defense

The People have the right to stand their ground in lawful places and to use proportionate force to defend self or others from unlawful violence.

No person acting in good faith to stop violent crime, terrorism, or imminent harm shall be criminally or civilly punished absent proof of malicious or reckless misuse.

Good-Samaritan protections apply to lawful defensive use of arms.

(h) Due Process in Risk-Based Restrictions

Any temporary restriction based on alleged risk or incapacity shall comply fully with Sections 2A and 4A of this Article.

No administrative suspension, delay, or revocation shall occur without:
• a prior judicial order,
• an adversarial hearing,
• clear and convincing evidence,
• and an expedited right of appeal.

(i) Temporary Risk Orders

Courts may impose temporary arms restrictions only where an individual poses an Imminent and Specific Risk of serious harm as defined in Article 0.

Such orders:
• shall not exceed 180 days without renewal,
• shall be narrowly tailored,
• and shall be immediately lifted upon cessation of risk.

No permanent deprivation may occur without full constitutional due process.

Section 4. Bodily Autonomy and Medical Integrity

No person shall be compelled to surrender bodily autonomy without grave, evidence-based justification and due process.

(a) Core Protections

This Section protects all persons against:
	•	forced medical procedures;
	•	involuntary experimentation;
	•	denial of necessary medical care;
	•	ideological, political, moral, demographic, or non-therapeutic procedures imposed on any person, including minors.

(b) Necessary Abortions

A necessary abortion is permitted only when:
	•	the life of the mother is at risk;
	•	the child will be stillborn; or
	•	the child will be born with no or extremely low quality of life.

Elective abortions must occur prior to detection of a fetal heartbeat unless approved by a state-appointed medical and ethical review panel operating under transparent, evidence-based criteria.

(c) Limitation

Nothing in this Section shall be construed to protect self-harm or medically unnecessary mutilation.

(d) High Evidentiary Threshold for Forced Intervention

No person may be subjected to involuntary medical treatment... unless the government establishes, by clear and convincing evidence, that the individual lacks decisional capacity and poses an Imminent and Specific Risk of serious harm (as defined in Article 0) that cannot be mitigated by less restrictive means.

(e) Independent Medical Evaluation

Any claim of incapacity shall require evaluation by two independent, licensed medical professionals, neither of whom may be employed by, contracted with, or subordinate to the detaining or petitioning authority.

(f) Judicial Determination Required

Findings of incapacity or authorization of non-consensual intervention shall have no legal effect absent a judicial determination entered on the record.

Emergency interventions undertaken without prior judicial order shall expire automatically within twenty-four (24) hours unless judicially affirmed.

(g) Strict Temporal Limits

Any judicial order authorizing involuntary treatment or confinement shall:
	•	specify a fixed expiration date not exceeding fourteen (14) days;
	•	be renewable only upon fresh evidence and renewed judicial findings; and
	•	never be indefinite or open-ended.

(h) Restoration Pathway

All orders issued under this Section shall include a clear and enforceable pathway for restoration of liberty upon demonstration of decisional capacity or mitigation of risk.

The burden of continued restraint shall rest at all times with the State.

(i) Absolute Prohibition on Ideological or Non-Therapeutic Justifications

No intervention, treatment, confinement, or bodily intrusion may be justified on ideological, political, moral, demographic, social, or conformity-based grounds, nor for purposes of normalization, belief correction, or social engineering.
(j) Prohibition on Fiscal Disarmament
The right to keep and bear arms shall not be burdened, discouraged, or suppressed through taxation, fees, insurance mandates, licensing charges, or financial conditions.

No tax, excise, surcharge, registration fee, or monetary requirement may be imposed on:
• the ownership,
• possession,
• carry,
• manufacture,
• transfer,
• training,
• or lawful use of arms or ammunition,

beyond ordinary, generally applicable sales taxes imposed on all goods.

No financial barrier may be used to render the right to self-defense inaccessible, impractical, or conditional.
(k) Definition of Arms

For purposes of this Constitution, “arms” means any tool, device, or system capable of being used for lawful personal, community, or national defense, including weapons, tools, and defensive technologies of any form or era.

No law may evade this right by reclassifying arms as tools, devices, consumer products, controlled items, or by semantic relabeling.

The substance of defensive capability, not the label, governs.

Section 5 — Due Process and Fair Trial

No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property except through lawful, transparent, and constitutionally valid judicial proceedings.

Due process is not merely procedural formality but a substantive guarantee of justice, fairness, speed, and enforceable remedy.

(a) Fundamental Trial Rights

Every accused person is guaranteed:

• timely and specific notice of charges;
• access to all exculpatory and inculpatory evidence;
• competent legal representation;
• the presumption of innocence;
• the right to remain silent;
• the right to confront and challenge witnesses and evidence;
• the right to a public trial by an impartial jury;
• and the right to appeal.

No evidence obtained through coercion, deception, unlawful search, or rights violations shall be admissible.

(b) Timeliness as Due Process

Justice delayed is justice denied.

Proceedings shall occur within the strict time limits established by this Article and related Articles.

Unjustified delay by the state constitutes a constitutional violation and entitles the injured party to:
• dismissal where appropriate,
• release from custody,
• compensation,
• and recovery of attorney fees.

(c) Remedies Are Integral to Due Process

Any process that denies meaningful, enforceable remedy for a proven rights violation is itself unconstitutional.

Courts shall have the affirmative duty to restore rights, reverse unlawful outcomes, and compensate injury.

(d) Habeas Corpus

The right to habeas corpus is absolute except as expressly and narrowly permitted by this Constitution.

No person may be held without the right to immediate judicial review of the lawfulness of detention.

(e) Bail and Pretrial Detention

All persons are presumed eligible for release pending trial.

Detention without bail is permitted only upon a judicial finding, by clear and convincing evidence after an adversarial hearing, that the person is:
• a violent threat,
• dangerously mentally incapacitated under Article 0,
• or a demonstrated flight risk.

Preventive detention may not be used as punishment, leverage, or convenience.

(f) Property and Asset Seizure

No property shall be seized except pursuant to a judicial warrant supported by probable cause.

Forfeiture requires:
• criminal conviction,
• exhaustion of appeals,
• and proof that the property itself was an instrumentality of the crime.

Wrongful seizure or forfeiture requires full restitution, damages, and costs.

(g) Prohibition on Parallel Justice Systems

No foreign, religious, private, corporate, or administrative tribunal may exercise coercive judicial power or override constitutional courts.

All adjudication affecting life, liberty, or property must be subject to full constitutional due process and judicial review.

(h) Equality of Testimony and Standing

All lawful residents possess equal standing before the law.

Testimony, evidence, and legal rights shall not be discounted, weighted, or disfavored on the basis of sex, ancestry, creed, status, or identity.

Section 5A — Pretrial Liberty and Bail

(a) Default to Release

Pretrial detention is disfavored.
Release on the least restrictive conditions sufficient to ensure appearance and public safety is the constitutional default.

No person shall be jailed solely because of inability to pay money bail.

(b) Narrow Grounds for Detention Without Bail

Detention without bail may occur only upon a judicial finding, supported by clear and convincing evidence after an adversarial hearing, that the individual:
	•	poses a specific and credible threat of serious violence; or
	•	presents a demonstrable and substantial flight risk.

Generalized fear, prior arrests, poverty, or speculative risk shall not suffice.

(c) Strict Time Limits

No person may be held in pretrial detention longer than:

• 30 days for ordinary offenses, or
• 60 days for grave offenses,

without commencement of trial.

Continuances, docket congestion, prosecutorial delay, or administrative backlog shall not toll or extend these limits.

Upon expiration, the person shall be immediately released on recognizance or non-custodial conditions.

(d) Prohibition on Coercive Detention

Pretrial detention shall not be used to induce or pressure:
• plea agreements,
• cooperation,
• confessions,
• or waiver of rights.

Any such use constitutes a constitutional violation requiring:
• immediate release,
• suppression of tainted evidence,
• and appropriate sanctions.

Section 6 — Equal Protection of the Law

All lawful residents stand equal before the law and are entitled to the same rights, protections, burdens, and remedies.

No person or class of persons may be favored, burdened, prosecuted, punished, protected, or exempted differently by the state on account of:

• ancestry,
• creed,
• sex,
• national origin,
• economic status,
• political belief,
• tribal identity,
• or lawful immigration status.

(a) Equal Application and Enforcement

Laws shall be applied and enforced uniformly.

Selective enforcement, selective non-enforcement, differential charging, or differential punishment based on protected characteristics is a constitutional violation.

(b) Equal Access to Rights and Remedies

All lawful residents possess equal standing to:
• assert rights,
• bring suit,
• seek protection,
• and obtain remedies.

No person may be denied or granted special legal status or immunity based on protected characteristics.

(c) Political Rights

Political rights may be limited only as expressly provided elsewhere in this Constitution and shall never be abridged through discrimination or indirect exclusion.

Section 7 — Prohibition of Slavery and Human Trafficking

Slavery, ownership of persons, and involuntary servitude are forbidden.

No human being may be treated as property, merchandise, or transferable labor.

(a) Restorative Penal Servitude

Following criminal conviction, a court may impose time-limited restorative labor as an alternative to incarceration for the purpose of:
• compensating victims,
• repairing social harm,
• or supporting rehabilitation.

Such restorative labor:
• shall not exceed seven years,
• shall be imposed only by judicial sentence,
• shall be conducted under humane conditions,
• shall include fair compensation or credit toward restitution,
• and shall never be sold, leased, or assigned to private parties.

(b) Heinous and Incorrigible Offenders

Persons convicted of Tier-Three or other grave violent crimes, or who refuse rehabilitation, may be:
• incarcerated,
• or assigned to secure, state-supervised labor programs,

for periods exceeding seven years, including life where constitutionally permitted.

Such confinement or labor:
• is not restitutionary servitude,
• shall not create property interests in the person,
• shall not be exploited for private profit,
• and shall remain subject to human dignity and constitutional oversight.

(c) Absolute Prohibition of Trafficking

Human trafficking, sexual exploitation, forced labor, coerced marriage, debt bondage, and trade in persons are among the gravest constitutional crimes.

No consent obtained through force, fraud, coercion, deception, or abuse of vulnerability shall be recognized.

Section 8 — Quartering, Requisition, and Property Integrity

No soldier, police officer, agent, or official of the state may be quartered, housed, stationed, or billeted in any private dwelling without the voluntary consent of the occupant.

(a) Emergency Requisition

In true emergencies, the temporary use of private property may occur only where strictly necessary to prevent imminent loss of life or catastrophic harm, and only under the following conditions:

• just compensation,
• narrow scope,
• temporary duration,
• and prompt judicial or legislative oversight.

All requisitioned property shall be returned in equivalent condition or compensated in full.

(b) Prohibition on Emergency Takings

No emergency, disaster, war, or crisis shall be used to justify permanent seizure, confiscation, or transfer of private property without full constitutional due process.

(c) Asset Forfeiture and Property Seizure

No property shall be forfeited, seized, or retained by the state absent:
• criminal conviction,
• exhaustion of appeals,
• and proof that the property itself was an instrumentality of the crime.

Civil asset forfeiture is prohibited.

(d) Eminent Domain

Private property may be taken for genuine public use only after:
• judicial determination of necessity,
• full due process,
• and advance payment of just compensation.

No taking for private development, revenue generation, or political favoritism shall be permitted.

Section 9 — Prohibition of Cruel or Excessive Punishment

Excessive bail, excessive fines, and cruel, degrading, or disproportionate punishment are forbidden.

Punishment shall serve justice, public safety, and rehabilitation, not cruelty, revenge, or spectacle.

(a) Proportional and Scaled Fines

Fines shall be proportionate to both:
• the gravity of the offense, and
• the financial means of the offender.

No fine may be imposed in a manner that:
• destroys basic livelihood,
• creates debt bondage,
• or functions as indirect imprisonment.

(b) Conditions of Confinement

No punishment or confinement shall involve:
• torture,
• degrading treatment,
• medical abuse,
• sensory deprivation,
• or conditions intended to break the human will.

All persons, including prisoners, retain human dignity and constitutional protection.

(c) Dangerous or Incapacitated Persons

Persons who pose a continuing and extreme danger due to:
• severe violent pathology, or
• irreversible mental incapacity

may be confined only under:
• full judicial process,
• periodic review,
• and the least restrictive conditions consistent with public safety.

Preventive confinement shall never become permanent punishment without conviction.

Section 10 — Reserved and Unenumerated Rights

All rights not expressly and lawfully delegated to government remain with the People.

The enumeration of rights in this Constitution shall not be construed to deny, disparage, or limit other rights retained by the People.

(a) Natural Rights Presumption

All persons possess inherent rights arising from human dignity, liberty, and conscience, whether or not those rights are explicitly listed.

Government bears the burden of proving constitutional authority to restrict any liberty.

(b) Prohibition on Rights Erosion

No branch of government may:
• redefine,
• narrow,
• condition,
• or indirectly extinguish
any right, enumerated or unenumerated.

Absence of textual enumeration shall never be construed as absence of right.

(c) Judicial Duty

Courts shall interpret this Constitution in favor of liberty where ambiguity exists.

Any doubt shall be resolved against the expansion of state power.

Section 11. Freedom of Information and Public Transparency

The People possess a constitutional right to access public records and communications of government, subject only to narrow judicially approved restrictions for:

(a) national security,
(b) active investigations,
(c) protection of vulnerable individuals.
(d) Judicial Enforcement and Deadlines

Petitions seeking access to public records under this Section shall be adjudicated within 10 days of filing. Failure to justify withholding within that period results in automatic disclosure. No court may extend secrecy absent specific written findings of imminent and concrete harm, and any such extension shall expire automatically within 30 days.
(e) Enforcement and Penalties

Knowing obstruction, concealment, destruction, falsification, or delay of records subject to this Section constitutes a constitutional violation and a grave offense. Civil liability, removal from office, and criminal referral are mandatory upon proof.
Secrecy shall be time-limited, justified, reviewable, and never used to conceal corruption.
Destruction or falsification of records is a constitutional crime.
Standing to sue is guaranteed.

(f). Absolute Limits on Secrecy and Classification

(a) Maximum Duration of Secrecy
No public record, communication, dataset, directive, intelligence product, analysis, or material subject to this Constitution may be classified, withheld, sealed, or otherwise denied public access for a period exceeding twenty-five (25) years from the date of its creation.

Upon expiration of that period, such material shall be automatically declassified and released in full, without further action, unless an extension is lawfully granted pursuant to this Section.

(b) Extraordinary Extension Requirements
An extension of secrecy beyond twenty-five (25) years may be granted only where all of the following conditions are satisfied:
	•	Congressional Certification
A select national security committee composed of no fewer than ten (10) members of each chamber of the Legislature shall certify, by recorded supermajority vote, that continued secrecy is strictly necessary to prevent concrete and imminent harm to the Republic.
	•	Judicial Approval
The Constitutional Review Court (CRC) shall approve the extension by written order, supported by specific findings that the constitutional standard for secrecy remains satisfied and that no narrower disclosure is feasible.
	•	Judicial Integrity Review
The Constitutional Judicial Commission (CJC) shall independently review the extension request to assess institutional capture, abuse of classification authority, or conflict of interest, and shall certify that the request is not motivated by embarrassment, reputational protection, political convenience, or concealment of wrongdoing.

Failure to satisfy any of these requirements shall result in immediate declassification.

(c) Limited Duration of Extensions
No extension granted under this Section may exceed five (5) years in duration.

Extensions may not be renewed automatically. Each extension requires a fresh, complete review under subsection (b), supported by updated findings and public notice of continued secrecy.

No record may be withheld beyond a cumulative total of forty (40) years under any circumstances.

(d) Public Override by the People
Notwithstanding any classification, extension, or judicial approval, the People retain ultimate authority over secrecy.

Any classified or withheld material shall be immediately declassified and released upon approval by:
	•	a public referendum achieving a two-thirds (2/3) supermajority of Civic Citizens,
	•	initiated by a public petition signed by no fewer than twenty percent (20%) of Civic Citizens eligible to vote.

No authority may delay, narrow, redact, or condition disclosure once such a vote is certified.

(e) Non-Justiciability of Secrecy Votes
No court may enjoin, stay, delay, or invalidate a declassification effected pursuant to subsection (d).
The judgment of the People in such matters is final and not subject to judicial override.

(f) Prohibited Grounds for Secrecy
Secrecy shall never be justified for the purpose of:
	•	concealing unlawful acts, constitutional violations, or grave offenses;
	•	avoiding embarrassment, political accountability, or reputational harm;
	•	shielding institutions, officials, contractors, or foreign partners from scrutiny;
	•	preserving ideological narratives or historical revisionism.

Any attempt to invoke secrecy for such purposes constitutes a constitutional violation and grave offense.

(g) Burden and Presumption
The burden of justifying secrecy or extension rests entirely upon the government.
All doubts shall be resolved in favor of disclosure.
(g). Criminal Liability for Willful Constitutional Betrayal

(a) Willful Breach of the Constitution Defined
A willful breach of the Constitution occurs where a person, acting under color of law, public authority, delegated power, or institutional control, knowingly and voluntarily violates a clear constitutional prohibition or duty, with intent to evade, undermine, nullify, or defeat the Constitution itself.

Mere error, negligence, reasonable disagreement, or good-faith interpretation shall not constitute a willful breach.

(b) Treason Classification
Any egregious and willful breach of the Constitution shall constitute treason against the Republic and shall be classified as a Tier Three offense under Article VII.

Such treason consists not in disagreement with policy, but in betrayal of sworn constitutional duty.

(c) High Treason
Where a willful constitutional breach:
	•	results in the death of innocent persons;
	•	results in the unlawful confinement, disappearance, or permanent deprivation of liberty of innocent persons; or
	•	enables or conceals mass constitutional violations through secrecy, force, or systemic abuse;

such conduct may be classified as high treason.

High treason is among the few offenses for which the federal government may consider capital punishment, subject to the strict conditions of this Constitution.
The preferred and presumptive punishment shall remain lifetime incapacitating confinement, absent extraordinary findings.

(d) Mandatory Consequences Upon Conviction
Any person convicted of a willful breach of the Constitution shall, at minimum:
	•	permanently forfeit Civic Citizenship;
	•	suffer total confiscation of all property and assets, real and personal, without compensation;
	•	be subject to permanent restriction of travel beyond a narrowly defined geographic area;
	•	be disqualified for life from holding any public office, exercising public authority, or engaging in employment above a menial or supervised level;
	•	be subject to formal public censure, including official records, disclosures, and reminders of the offense in all future dealings with the Republic.

No pardon, commutation, or restoration of status shall be granted except by constitutional supermajority and public notice.

(e) Additional Punishments Permitted
Depending on the nature, scale, and consequences of the betrayal, sentencing may include:
	•	lifetime confinement under Tier Three conditions;
	•	mandatory labor consistent with humane standards;
	•	permanent disbarment from any licensed profession;
	•	symbolic and reputational sanctions designed to ensure the offense is neither forgotten nor repeated.

Punishment shall be harsh, honest, and proportional—but never concealed.

(f) Ridicule as Civic Sanction
Where appropriate and not cruel, the Republic may impose civic ridicule as a formal sanction for constitutional betrayal, including mandated acknowledgment of wrongdoing, public disclosure of offenses, and symbolic reminders designed to deter future violations.

The purpose of such sanction is deterrence, moral clarity, and preservation of constitutional memory, not sadism or spectacle.

(g) Strict Proof of Willfulness Required
No person may be convicted under this Section unless the prosecution proves beyond a reasonable doubt that:
	•	the defendant acted without coercion, duress, or unlawful pressure;
	•	the defendant possessed clear knowledge of the constitutional prohibition or duty violated;
	•	the defendant had meaningful opportunity to refuse or resist the unlawful act;
	•	the defendant nevertheless chose betrayal of the Constitution.

Where credible evidence of coercion, threat, or unlawful command exists, such evidence shall bar conviction under this Section and shall instead be prosecuted against those responsible for the coercion.

(h) No Shield of Office or Emergency
Neither office, rank, national security claim, emergency declaration, secrecy classification, superior orders, nor institutional policy shall excuse or mitigate liability for willful constitutional betrayal.
(i) Protection for Truthful Disclosure

No person shall be criminally, civilly, administratively, or professionally punished for possessing, disclosing, publishing, or transmitting truthful information that evidences:

1. constitutional violations,
2. unlawful acts,
3. corruption,
4. abuse of authority,
5. war crimes,
6. or misuse of secrecy or classification.

This protection applies to whistleblowers, journalists, publishers, researchers, and private citizens.

No secrecy law, classification, contract, or oath may override this protection.
(j) Construction and Lock Status
This Section shall be construed narrowly but firmly, reserved for the gravest acts of betrayal.

Pursuant to Article XV, this Section is lock-protected and may not be repealed, diluted, or reinterpreted except by constitutional amendment meeting the highest procedural threshold.


Section 12. Protection Against Exploitative or Dangerous Acts

Freedom does not extend to acts that degrade human dignity or endanger life, including:

(a) sexual exploitation,
(b) grooming,
(c) coercive rituals,
(d) biological or chemical hazards,
(e) animal cruelty,
(f) dangerous ideological indoctrination.
(g) Requirement of Concrete Harm

No act shall be prohibited under this Section unless it involves:
1. non-consensual exploitation,
2. physical injury,
3. credible threat of injury,
4. unlawful coercion,
5. or demonstrable and substantial risk of biological, chemical, or psychological harm.

Mere expression of belief, ideology, religion, or opinion shall not constitute a violation.
(h) Meaning of Dangerous Ideological Indoctrination.
For purposes of this Article, “Dangerous ideological indoctrination” means the intentional conditioning of persons, especially minors or dependents, through coercion, isolation, or psychological manipulation, to compel unlawful violence, self-harm, or surrender of autonomy. 
It shall not include peaceful teaching, advocacy, religious instruction, political belief, or dissent. (As defined in Article 0.)
(i) Meaning of Coercive Rituals.

For purposes of this Article, “Coercive rituals” means practices that involve: 
1. physical injury, 
2. sexual exploitation, 
3. confinement, 
4. forced ingestion, 
5. or credible threats of harm, 
and shall not include voluntary cultural, religious, or symbolic practices.
(As defined in Article 0.)
Section 12A. Structural and Indirect Restraints

(a) Functional Test
Any policy, system, or condition that foreseeably results in confinement, forced treatment, loss of movement, or deprivation of liberty shall be treated as detention for constitutional purposes, regardless of formal designation.

(b) Ban on Indirect Compulsion
Liberty shall not be curtailed through denial of housing, employment, travel, benefits, licenses, or civil participation as a means of forcing compliance with treatment, confinement, or behavioral mandates not otherwise authorized by this Constitution.

(c) Judicial Remedy
Structural or indirect restraints found to violate this Section shall be enjoined immediately, and affected persons shall be entitled to damages and restoration of rights.
(d) Substance Over Label

No restraint, penalty, or deprivation shall be exempt from this Section by being labeled as an incentive, eligibility condition, risk mitigation, public health measure, or administrative requirement.

The practical effect on liberty shall govern.
(e) Covered Actors

This Section applies to all actions taken by or through:
1. government agencies,
2. publicly funded entities,
3. regulated monopolies,
4. or private parties acting under color of law.

No delegation shall evade constitutional restraint.

Section 12B. Protection Against Retaliation

(a) Absolute Prohibition
No person shall be retaliated against for asserting, assisting, reporting, or litigating rights under this Article.

(b) Forms of Retaliation Prohibited
Retaliation includes arrest, investigation, audit, surveillance, employment action, license revocation, denial of benefits, intimidation, harassment, or reputational attack.

(c) Presumption of Retaliation
Adverse action taken within one year of protected activity is presumptively retaliatory unless rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.

(d) Enhanced Damages
Retaliatory violations warrant enhanced damages and mandatory removal of responsible officials.
(e) Proxy and Third-Party Retaliation

Retaliation includes any action taken through or by:
1. employers,
2. financial institutions,
3. landlords,
4. insurers,
5. utilities,
6. digital platforms,
7. or other private entities,

where such action is encouraged, requested, coerced, or induced by the state or its agents.
(f) Administrative and Regulatory Harassment

Retaliation includes targeted or disproportionate use of:
• inspections,
• permits,
• zoning,
• taxation,
• licensing,
• code enforcement,
• or regulatory process

for the purpose of punishing or deterring protected activity.

Section 13. Right to Informational Self-Determination and Protection from Surveillance

(a) Inherent Right
The People possess an inherent and inalienable right to privacy, control, and sovereignty over their personal information.

This right includes, but is not limited to, information concerning an individual’s identity, location, communications, associations, health, beliefs, conduct, transactions, preferences, biological data, digital footprint, and inferred characteristics.

(b) Universal Application
This right binds all entities, public and private alike, without exception.

No corporation, organization, platform, intermediary, data broker, employer, insurer, advertiser, or agent may evade this Section by contract, terms of service, consent laundering, proxy collection, or technical indirection.

(c) Consent Standard
No entity may collect, process, infer, profile, store, share, sell, trade, license, or monetize personal data except where:
	•	explicit, informed, granular, and freely given consent has been obtained; and
	•	such consent is revocable at any time without penalty; or
	•	collection is strictly necessary and proportionate to provide a service knowingly and affirmatively requested by the individual.

Silence, continued use, bundled consent, deceptive design, or economic coercion shall not constitute valid consent.

(d) Data Minimization and Purpose Limitation
All data collection shall be limited to what is strictly necessary for a specified, legitimate purpose.

Secondary use, behavioral modeling, predictive profiling, or retention beyond necessity is prohibited.

(e) Prohibition on Mass and Commercial Surveillance
Mass, dragnet, or systemic surveillance of persons for commercial, behavioral, reputational, advertising, or influence purposes is forbidden.

The creation or maintenance of detailed behavioral, psychological, or reputational profiles for purposes unrelated to a directly requested service is prohibited.

(f) Sensitive Inferences
The inference, prediction, or classification of sensitive attributes — including health status, political belief, religious belief, sexual orientation, psychological traits, or moral disposition — is subject to the highest level of protection and shall be presumed unlawful absent explicit, purpose-specific consent.

(g) Right to Access, Correction, and Erasure
Every person has the right to:
	•	know what personal data is held about them;
	•	access such data in intelligible form;
	•	correct inaccuracies;
	•	demand erasure where retention is no longer justified.

(h) Enforcement and Remedies
Violations of this Section constitute infringements of fundamental rights.

Affected persons shall be entitled to injunctive relief, suppression of unlawfully obtained data, compensatory and statutory damages, and all remedies provided elsewhere in this Article.

Systemic or willful violations may trigger liability under Article XI and, where egregious, prosecution under Article VII.

(i) Construction
This Section shall be construed to dismantle systems of exploitation, surveillance, manipulation, and control that reduce persons to data assets, behavioral products, or targets of influence.
(j) Lawful Investigation and Illicit Material Exception
Nothing in this Section shall be construed to prohibit:
	•	Targeted data collection, analysis, or monitoring conducted by law enforcement pursuant to a lawful warrant, court order, or constitutionally authorized investigative power;
	•	The detection, reporting, or preservation of evidence of illicit material, including material involving violence, sexual exploitation of minors, trafficking, terrorism, or other grave offenses, where such activity is:
	•	narrowly tailored,
	•	directly related to the identification or prevention of crime, and
	•	not repurposed for commercial, reputational, or behavioral profiling;
	•	Mandatory reporting duties imposed by law for known or reasonably suspected criminal material, provided such duties do not authorize generalized surveillance of lawful persons.
(k) Invalidity of Coerced or Essential-Service Consent

Consent shall be void where access to employment, housing, healthcare, education, banking, communications, transportation, or participation in modern society is conditioned upon surrender of informational rights.

No person shall be forced to trade privacy for survival, livelihood, or civic participation.

(l) Public–Private Surveillance Prohibition

No government entity may request, purchase, receive, or induce the collection of personal data by private parties in a manner that would be unlawful if performed directly by the state.

Data obtained in violation of this principle shall be inadmissible and must be destroyed.

Section 14. Lock Designation

Pursuant to Article XV (Amendments, Lock Clauses, and Anti-Emergency Drift), Article II — Rights, Liberties, and Personal Sovereignty is hereby designated as LOCK-PROTECTED.
This lock extends to all interpretive rules, timelines, remedies, and cross-references to Article 0 definitions incorporated herein.
 A. Scope of Lock

This lock applies to the entirety of Article II, including but not limited to:
	•	all enumerated rights, liberties, and protections;
	•	all interpretive rules, enforcement mechanisms, timelines, remedies, and liabilities;
	•	all provisions governing privacy, bodily autonomy, due process, informational self-determination, transparency, and protection against coercive or exploitative acts.

No portion of Article II shall be repealed, suspended, weakened, narrowed, reinterpreted, or rendered ineffectual except in strict conformity with this Lock Declaration.

 B. Prohibited Forms of Alteration

The following are expressly forbidden with respect to Article II:
	•	dilution of rights through balancing tests, proportionality frameworks, or interest-weighing doctrines not expressly authorized by the Constitution;
	•	reclassification of rights restrictions as civil, administrative, medical, regulatory, emergency, or non-punitive to evade constitutional safeguards;
	•	suspension or circumvention of rights by declaration of emergency, crisis, necessity, national security, or asserted expertise;
	•	indirect erosion through delegation, privatization, proxy enforcement, or consent laundering;
	•	judicial reinterpretation that narrows scope, standing, remedies, timelines, or enforceability;
	•	creation of parallel legal regimes, emergency courts, special jurisdictions, or extraordinary procedures to avoid or bypass Article II protections.

Any attempt to accomplish such alteration by statute, regulation, executive action, judicial doctrine, or international agreement is void ab initio.

 C. Permitted Amendments (Narrow Exception)

Amendment to Article II may occur only for the purpose of:
	•	clarifying internal consistency or cross-article coordination without reducing substantive protection;
	•	expanding rights, remedies, or enforcement protections;
	•	incorporating newly recognized forms of coercion, surveillance, exploitation, or domination not previously contemplated, provided such amendments strengthen liberty rather than restrict it.

No amendment may reduce, condition, delay, or subordinate any right secured by Article II.

 D. Amendment Threshold

Any amendment to Article II shall require all of the following:
	•	approval by a supermajority of both chambers of the Legislature, as defined in Article XV;
	•	certification by the Supreme Court of the Republic that the amendment does not diminish substantive rights or enforcement;
	•	independent review by the Constitutional Judicial Commission (CJC) affirming absence of institutional capture or coercion;
	•	ratification by the People, under procedures no less rigorous than those required for original constitutional adoption.

Failure to satisfy any requirement shall invalidate the amendment in its entirety.

 E. Anti-Backsliding Rule

No amendment, statute, regulation, or judicial interpretation adopted after the ratification of this Lock shall be construed to reduce the level of protection afforded by Article II.

Where conflict exists between newer provisions and Article II, Article II shall control.

 F. Judicial Duty

All courts of the Republic are bound to:
	•	enforce Article II as written;
	•	resolve ambiguities in favor of liberty, dignity, and personal sovereignty;
	•	reject doctrines that would transform rights into privileges or permissions.

Failure by a court or judge to honor this Lock constitutes constitutional misconduct.

 G. Declaration of Intent

This Lock reflects the deliberate judgment of the People that liberty is not provisional, that dignity is not negotiable, and that rights once secured shall not be surrendered to fear, convenience, fashion, or power.

Article II stands as the irreducible moral and legal boundary of the Republic.


Article XX — Administrative Structure and Civil Service

Charge

This Article establishes constitutional principles governing the structure, authority, and operation of administrative bodies and the civil service within the Republic. Administrative authority shall be executive in nature, limited to the faithful implementation of law, and subordinate to constitutional governance, democratic accountability, and the rights of the People. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to authorize administrative sovereignty, independent policymaking, or the exercise of power beyond that expressly granted by law and subject to transparency and judicial review.

Section 1. Nature of Administrative Authority

a. Executive and Subordinate Character
Administrative authority is executive in nature and exists solely to carry out and implement lawfully enacted decisions of the constitutional branches.
Administrative bodies possess no independent sovereignty, legitimacy, or authority apart from that which is expressly granted by law.

b. No Policymaking or Lawmaking Power
No administrative body, office, or official may create, amend, suspend, interpret, or expand law, policy, or rights beyond explicit statutory authorization.
Administrative interpretation shall be limited to faithful execution and shall not substitute internal judgment, theory, or preference for enacted law.

c. Instrumental Role
Administration is an instrument of governance, not a governing authority.
Administrative bodies shall execute decisions made through lawful constitutional processes and shall not claim authority derived from expertise, professionalism, efficiency, necessity, or institutional continuity.

d. Prohibition on Independent Doctrine
No administrative body may adopt internal doctrines, frameworks, professional standards, academic theories, or ideological constructs as binding authority absent explicit legislative enactment.
Internal guidance shall not possess the force of law.

e. Non-Expansion by Practice or Custom
Administrative authority shall not expand through custom, precedent, internal practice, emergency habit, or historical usage.
Powers not expressly granted are reserved and withheld.

f. Transparency and Accountability
All exercises of administrative authority are subject to transparency, recordkeeping, and public accountability consistent with Article XI.
Administrative convenience shall not justify opacity, discretion without review, or insulation from oversight.

g. Subordination to Constitutional Limits
Administrative authority is always subordinate to the Constitution, the laws enacted thereunder, and the rights of the People.
Any administrative act inconsistent with constitutional limitation is void and shall be so declared by the Constitutional Review Court upon petition by any affected person, the CJC, or the Legislature.

Section 2. Civil Service as Public Stewardship

a. Civil Service as Trust
Civil service is a public trust exercised on behalf of the People.
Civil servants hold authority only as stewards and custodians of lawful public functions, not as independent actors or policy authorities.

b. Duty of Loyalty and Neutrality
Civil servants owe a duty of loyalty to the Constitution and the law, not to any political party, faction, ideology, doctrine, academic school, or private interest.
The execution of public duties shall be neutral, impartial, and faithful to enacted law.

c. Duty of Candor
Civil servants have an affirmative duty of honesty and candor in all official actions, records, communications, and representations.
Knowingly misleading the public, elected officials, courts, or oversight bodies constitutes a breach of public trust.

d. Service, Not Governance
Civil service exists to administer and implement decisions lawfully made by constitutional authorities.
Civil servants shall not govern, direct public outcomes, or substitute administrative judgment for democratic or judicial decision-making.

e. No Independent Public Mandate
Civil servants possess no independent mandate from expertise, professionalism, credentialing, or institutional role.
Public legitimacy flows solely from the Constitution and laws enacted thereunder.

f. Fiduciary Responsibility
Civil servants shall exercise care, restraint, and diligence in the use of public authority, resources, and information.
Misuse of authority for personal, institutional, ideological, or concealed purposes constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty.

g. Accountability to the People
Civil servants are accountable to the People through lawful oversight, transparency, and review.
Claims of internal discretion, professional judgment, or administrative necessity shall not defeat accountability.

Section 3. Limits of Administrative Power

a. No Implied Authority
Administrative bodies possess only those powers expressly granted by the Constitution or by law.
No power shall be implied from necessity, efficiency, expertise, tradition, or institutional practice.

b. Prohibition on Independent Rulemaking
No administrative body may promulgate rules, standards, guidance, or directives having binding effect absent explicit legislative authorization.
Administrative instruments lacking such authorization shall have no force of law.

c. No Expansion by Interpretation
Statutory ambiguity shall not be construed to enlarge administrative authority.
Where doubt exists, interpretation shall favor restraint and deference to legislative intent.

d. Emergency Authority Strictly Limited
Claims of emergency or exigency do not create new administrative powers.
Any temporary authority exercised under emergency conditions shall be narrowly construed and shall expire automatically absent timely legislative ratification.

e. Internal Policies Not Law
Internal manuals, policies, professional standards, best practices, or compliance frameworks shall not create enforceable obligations for the public absent express legal enactment.
Violation of internal policy alone shall not constitute legal wrongdoing.

f. No Authority by Delegation Chain
Administrative authority shall not be enlarged through cascading delegation, subcontracting, or internal redistribution of responsibility.
Delegated authority shall be construed narrowly and may not exceed the scope of the original grant.

g. Reservation of Power
All powers not expressly conferred upon administrative bodies are reserved to the People and the constitutional branches.
Silence shall not be interpreted as consent.
h. Emergency Authority Sunset
Any administrative authority exercised on the basis of emergency, urgency, or exigency shall expire automatically within a fixed period unless expressly ratified by the Legislature.

Successive or rolling emergency claims for the same or substantially similar purpose are prohibited absent a new and distinct legislative grant.

Employment standards shall be job-related, functionally defined, and uniformly applied.
Personnel offices shall not create, modify, or enforce standards beyond those lawfully enacted.

Administrative bodies and civil servants shall execute the law neutrally and without ideological bias.
No office, agency, or official may advance, impose, or enforce political, moral, philosophical, academic, or social ideologies through administrative action.

Ideological instruction, belief conditioning, or values-based programming unrelated to lawful job performance is prohibited.

e. No Governance by Internal Theory or Framework
Administrative bodies shall not govern through internal theoretical models, academic constructs, or professional frameworks not enacted into law.
Such constructs may inform internal study but shall not be binding on employees or the public.

f. Enforcement and Nullification
Any administrative action, policy, or employment decision taken in violation of this Section is void.
Affected individuals shall be entitled to relief and remedies as provided by law and by Article XI.
g. Protection of Lawful Expression
Nothing in this Article shall be construed to prohibit civil servants from providing truthful information, factual testimony, technical explanation, or lawful advice when requested by competent authority or required by law.


Section 6. Neutrality, Merit, and Appointment

a. Merit Defined
Merit in civil service appointment, promotion, and retention shall be defined by demonstrable competence, qualifications, experience, and performance directly related to the lawful duties of the position.

b. Prohibition on Ideological or Extraneous Criteria
No appointment, promotion, evaluation, or retention decision may be based upon political affiliation, ideological belief, academic doctrine, moral viewpoint, demographic classification, or any criterion unrelated to lawful job performance.

Appointments to civil service positions shall be made through transparent, reviewable processes designed to ensure fairness, competence, and accountability.
Selection criteria and decision rationales shall be documented and preserved.

d. No Credentialism as Authority
Professional credentials, academic degrees, or certifications shall not confer independent authority or policymaking power.

Preferential treatment, exemptions, or disparate standards are prohibited absent explicit legal authorization.

f. Prohibition on Loyalty Tests
No civil servant shall be required to demonstrate loyalty to any individual, party, ideology, institution, or internal doctrine beyond loyalty to the Constitution and the law.

g. Accountability in Appointment Authority
Officials responsible for appointment and promotion decisions are accountable for compliance with this Section.
Knowingly violating merit or neutrality requirements constitutes a breach of public trust.

Section 7. Discipline, Due Process, and the Boundary of Punishment

a. Administrative Discipline Distinguished
Administrative discipline exists solely to ensure lawful performance of duties, integrity of operations, and continuity of service.
It shall not be punitive in nature and shall not substitute for criminal, civil, or constitutional adjudication.

b. Due Process in Administrative Discipline
Any civil servant subject to disciplinary action is entitled to notice of the alleged misconduct, a clear statement of applicable standards, an opportunity to respond, and a reasoned decision based on the record.
Discipline imposed without due process is void.

c. Limits of Disciplinary Authority
Administrative bodies may impose only those disciplinary measures expressly authorized by law and proportionate to administrative error or misconduct.
Sanctions shall not extend beyond employment status, duties, or lawful conditions of service.

d. Boundary Between Discipline and Punishment
Where conduct reasonably indicates criminal behavior, constitutional violation, corruption, retaliation, or abuse of power, the matter shall be referred to the Constitutional Review Court and appropriate prosecutorial authority.
Administrative bodies shall not conceal, resolve internally, or substitute discipline for adjudication of such conduct.

e. Prohibition on Internal Adjudication of Rights
Administrative bodies shall not adjudicate guilt, innocence, liability, or constitutional rights.
Any attempt to do so constitutes an unlawful assumption of judicial power.

f. No Retaliatory Discipline
Disciplinary authority shall not be exercised in retaliation for lawful conduct, including whistleblowing, refusal of unlawful orders, protected speech, or participation in oversight or judicial processes.
Retaliatory discipline is void and constitutes a breach of public trust.
The Constitutional Review Court may order immediate reinstatement, back pay, and injunctive relief.

Secret, informal, or undocumented discipline is prohibited.

Civil servants have an affirmative duty to refuse any order, directive, instruction, or request that is unlawful, unconstitutional, or beyond the authority of the issuing official or body.

b. No Penalty for Lawful Refusal
No civil servant shall suffer adverse action, discipline, retaliation, or disadvantage for refusing to carry out an unlawful or unconstitutional order.
Any such adverse action is void.

c. Documentation and Reporting
A civil servant who refuses an unlawful order shall document the refusal and may report the matter to the Constitutional Judicial Commission, the Constitutional Review Court, or other lawful investigative authorities without fear of reprisal.

d. No Reliance on Superior Orders
Obedience to superior orders does not excuse unlawful action.
Civil servants remain personally accountable for compliance with constitutional and legal limits.

e. Protection of Good-Faith Judgment
Where the unlawfulness of an order is reasonably disputed, good-faith refusal or delay pending clarification or review shall be protected conduct.

f. Escalation of Systemic Abuse
Patterns of unlawful orders, coercion to comply, or retaliation for refusal shall constitute evidence of institutional abuse and shall constitute evidence of institutional abuse and shall be certified to the Constitutional Judicial Commission, which may petition the Constitutional Review Court for remediation or dissolution.

Section 9. Agency Structure, Scope, and Sunset

a. Defined Scope of Authority
Each administrative agency shall operate within a clearly defined scope of authority established by law.
Functions, jurisdiction, and limits shall be expressly stated and publicly accessible.

Administrative resistance to lawful consolidation or dissolution constitutes a breach of public trust.

g. Public Disclosure of Structure
The organizational structure, leadership, reporting lines, and delegated authorities of each agency shall be publicly disclosed and maintained as a matter of record.
h. Transitional Administration
Upon lawful dissolution, consolidation, or restructuring of an administrative body, reasonable transitional measures may be employed to wind down operations and protect vested rights lawfully accrued prior to dissolution.

Administrative bodies shall not obstruct, delay, or frustrate public access through unnecessary complexity, procedural barriers, or technical design.
Administrative systems shall be designed to facilitate understanding, not to deter inquiry.

g. Supremacy of Transparency Obligations
Claims of administrative convenience, efficiency, confidentiality, or professional discretion shall not defeat the transparency and recordkeeping obligations imposed by this Article and by Article XI.

Section 11. Accountability, Removal, and Liability

a. Personal Accountability
Civil servants and administrative officials are personally accountable for the lawful exercise of their authority.
No office, title, or institutional role shields an individual from responsibility for unlawful, unconstitutional, or bad-faith administrative action.

b. Removal for Cause
Civil servants may be removed from office for cause, including breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of authority, corruption, retaliation, concealment, or knowing violation of constitutional or statutory limits.
Removal decisions shall be documented and subject to review as provided by law.

c. No Institutional Immunity
Administrative bodies shall not claim institutional immunity to shield individuals from accountability.
Collective decision-making does not absolve personal responsibility.

d. Escalation to Legal Liability
Where administrative conduct constitutes criminal behavior, constitutional violation, or grave abuse of public trust, the matter shall be referred for prosecution or judicial adjudication pursuant to Article VII and Article VI.
Administrative resolution shall not preclude legal accountability.

e. Joint and Several Liability
Where unlawful administrative action results from coordinated conduct, all responsible participants are jointly and severally liable to the extent of their involvement.

Concealment or expungement of such records is prohibited.

Section 12. Non-Delegation and Anti-Proxy Rule

a. Non-Delegation of Administrative Authority
Administrative authority shall not be delegated, transferred, or outsourced to private entities, nongovernmental organizations, contractors, consultants, foundations, academic institutions, or international bodies except as expressly authorized by law for limited, ministerial functions.

b. No Proxy Governance
No administrative body may govern, regulate, enforce, surveil, adjudicate, or otherwise exercise public authority through proxies or intermediaries in order to evade constitutional, statutory, or transparency obligations.

c. Functional Test of Authority
Where a private or non-governmental entity performs functions that materially influence or determine public outcomes, such entity shall be deemed to exercise public authority and shall be subject to all constitutional duties, limitations, and liabilities applicable to administrative bodies.

d. Accountability Parity
Entities exercising delegated administrative functions are subject to the same standards of transparency, recordkeeping, neutrality, fiduciary duty, and accountability as the delegating authority.
No lesser standard shall apply by reason of contractual form or organizational status.

e. Prohibition on Ideological, Technical, or Academic Proxies
Administrative authority shall not be exercised through ideological programs, technical platforms, academic frameworks, professional standards, or automated systems that substitute private judgment for lawful public decision-making.

f. Termination and Debarment
Any delegation or proxy arrangement undertaken in violation of this Section is void.
Entities participating in such arrangements are subject to termination of contracts, permanent debarment from public authority, and liability as provided by law.

Section 13. Interpretation and Supremacy

a. Rule of Construction
This Article shall be interpreted to preserve neutrality in administration, restraint in authority, and subordination of administrative power to lawfully enacted decisions of the constitutional branches.

Article XX-A — National Public Service Corps

Section 1. Establishment and Purpose

The Republic may establish a National Public Service Corps as a civilian institution dedicated to voluntary service in furtherance of public welfare, civic resilience, and intergenerational stewardship.

The Corps exists to cultivate practical competence, shared responsibility, and constructive contribution to the Republic, without militarization, compulsion, or ideological conformity.

⸻

Section 2. Civilian and Non-Coercive Character

The National Public Service Corps shall be strictly civilian in nature.
	1.	Participation shall be voluntary.
	2.	No person shall be compelled to serve as a condition of citizenship, voting, education, employment, or access to public benefits.
	3.	The Corps shall not be organized, trained, or deployed as a military or paramilitary force.

Nothing in this Article authorizes conscription or forced labor.

⸻

Section 3. Relationship to Citizenship and Civic Formation

Service in the Corps may be recognized by law as a form of honorable civic contribution.

Such recognition may include educational credit, professional training, or public acknowledgment, but shall not create a privileged civic class or abridge the equal rights of non-participants.

Service shall complement, not replace, civic education as provided in Article XVIII.

⸻

Section 4. Scope of Authorized Service

The National Public Service Corps may undertake service activities authorized by law that are consistent with this Constitution, including but not limited to:
	•	environmental stewardship and land enrichment;
	•	infrastructure maintenance and resilience;
	•	disaster preparedness and recovery;
	•	public health support;
	•	skills training and community assistance.

No service activity may be authorized that violates individual rights, due process, or constitutional limits.

⸻

Section 5. Relationship to Private Duty and Local Authority

The Corps shall not be used to:
	1.	substitute for private legal duties imposed under Article IX;
	2.	displace lawful private labor through coercion or unfair competition;
	3.	override local land use authority or community consent.

Service activities shall proceed, where applicable, in cooperation with local governments, landholders, and communities.

⸻

Section 6. Prohibitions

The National Public Service Corps shall not:
	1.	enforce law, conduct investigations, or exercise police powers;
	2.	regulate land, industry, or speech;
	3.	engage in political advocacy or partisan activity;
	4.	impose ideological instruction as a condition of service;
	5.	serve as a pretext for land seizure, population relocation, or social control.

Any attempt to repurpose the Corps for such ends is unconstitutional.

⸻

Section 7. Organization and Oversight

The organization, administration, and funding of the National Public Service Corps shall be prescribed by law, subject to:
	1.	transparency requirements;
	2.	civilian oversight;
	3.	public audit;
	4.	judicial review.

No emergency authority may expand the powers or scope of the Corps beyond what is authorized under ordinary law.

⸻

Section 8. Interaction with Other Articles

This Article shall be construed in harmony with:
	•	Article IX (Land, Homesteading, and Agricultural Duty),
	•	Article XVIII (Civic Formation and Education),
	•	Article XX-B (Sustainable Forestry, Agroforestry, and Land Enrichment),
	•	Article XV (Locks and Anti-Emergency Drift).

Where doubt exists, the construction that most preserves voluntariness, civilian character, and constitutional restraint shall control.

⸻

Section 9. Interpretation

The National Public Service Corps is an instrument of service, not governance.

It shall be interpreted as a means of enabling constructive civic contribution, not as a vehicle for compulsion, ideology, or administrative overreach.

⸻

Article XX-B — Sustainable Forestry, Agroforestry, and Land Enrichment

Charge

This Article establishes constitutional principles governing sustainable forestry, agroforestry, soil stewardship, and land enrichment practices within the Republic. Any public authority exercised under this Article shall be limited to lawful, transparent, and accountable measures designed to promote long-term soil health, ecological sustainability, food security, and environmental resilience. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to authorize centralized land control, ideological land management, compulsory practices, or regulatory overreach beyond powers expressly granted by law and subject to constitutional limits.

Section 1. Nature of Sustainable Forestry and Agroforestry Authority

a. Executive and Subordinate Character
Authority to promote, incentivize, or regulate sustainable forestry, agroforestry, polyculture, and soil enrichment (including terra preta-inspired biochar amendment) is executive in nature and exists solely to implement lawfully enacted policies of the constitutional branches.
b. No Independent Policymaking
No administrative body may mandate, expand, or interpret practices beyond explicit statutory authorization. Internal doctrines, academic theories, or ideological preferences (e.g., forced monoculture alternatives or exclusion of traditional methods) shall not bind the public or landowners.
c. Instrumental Role
Administration serves as a facilitator of voluntary, merit-based adoption — providing information, incentives, and technical support — not as governor of land use decisions.
d. Prohibition on Compulsion or Ideological Conditions
No authority may condition land use, subsidies, permits, or benefits on adherence to ideological, academic, or extraneous frameworks unrelated to lawful objectives.
Section 2. Core Principles and Practices Recognized
a. Recognition of Ancient Models
The Republic recognizes the proven efficacy of indigenous Amazonian practices: intentional creation of fertile anthropogenic soils (terra preta) via biochar from slash-and-char, organic amendments (manure, bones, pottery, compost), and polyculture agroforestry systems that integrate trees, crops, and useful species for sustained productivity, biodiversity, and long-term carbon sequestration.
b. Promotion of Voluntary Adoption
Lawful policy may encourage voluntary adoption through incentives (tax relief, grants, technical aid) for practices that:
	•	Enrich soils with stable biochar;
	•	Establish polyculture agroforestry and food forests;
	•	Use controlled, low-severity burns for nutrient cycling without large-scale deforestation;
	•	Integrate edible, medicinal, and resource species into managed forests.
c. Climate and Resource Benefits
Such practices serve the common good by: sequestering atmospheric carbon for centuries, enhancing soil fertility and water retention, increasing food/resource abundance, reducing pressure on wild forests, and building resilience to climate shifts.
Section 3. Limits and Safeguards
a. No Implied or Expanded Authority
No agency may claim power to mandate land conversion, restrict traditional farming, or impose standards absent explicit legislative grant.
b. Neutrality and Merit
Incentives and programs shall be based on demonstrable outcomes (e.g., soil improvement, carbon storage metrics) — not ideological alignment, demographic criteria, or credentialism.
c. Transparency and Accountability
All programs, incentives, and monitoring shall be public, recorded, and subject to review. Claims of expertise or necessity shall not defeat oversight.
d. Reservation of Rights
All powers not expressly granted are reserved to the People, landowners, and constitutional branches. Silence or custom shall not create authority.
e. Sunset and Reauthorization
Programs promoting these practices shall be subject to periodic legislative review and reauthorization.
Article XX-C — Construction Corps
Charge
The Republic recognizes that genuine civic qualification requires real sacrifice and contribution, not administrative theater or credentialed shortcuts. The Construction Corps exists as a rigorous, labor-intensive pathway within the National Public Service Corps, ensuring that those who seek civic citizenship through public works earn it through direct, physically demanding effort that builds and sustains the common good. This Article guarantees the integrity of that pathway against dilution, substitution, displacement of private labor, or capture by managerial or political interests.
Section 1. Establishment and Purpose
The Republic may authorize a Construction Corps as a distinct operational arm of the National Public Service Corps. Its sole constitutional purpose is to execute physically demanding, field-based public works essential to national resilience, civic infrastructure, and long-term human flourishing, including but not limited to:
(a) construction, repair, and maintenance of roads, bridges, levees, drainage systems, waterworks, public buildings, and critical energy/transportation infrastructure;
(b) disaster recovery, debris removal, and environmental remediation under hazardous or austere conditions;
(c) other manual, labor-intensive projects that materially preserve or enhance the Republic’s physical and communal fabric.
Section 2. Nature of Service
Service in the Construction Corps shall consist primarily of direct manual labor and field execution. Credit toward civic citizenship or other constitutional recognition shall be granted only for:
(a) hands-on participation in physical construction, repair, maintenance, or recovery operations;
(b) work performed under real environmental exposure, physical risk, or sustained hardship consistent with the demands of essential public infrastructure.
Supervisory, administrative, planning, advisory, training, inspection, or symbolic roles shall not satisfy service requirements unless accompanied by substantial, documented direct labor participation.
Section 3. Integrity and Anti-Dilution Rules
No person may fulfill Construction Corps service obligations through:
(a) delegation, substitution, or proxy labor;
(b) monetary payment, purchase, or financial equivalence;
(c) credential-based waivers, academic credit, or administrative certification;
(d) nominal or ceremonial participation;
(e) reclassification of duties to reduce physical demand or exposure.
Any attempt to circumvent these requirements constitutes a grave offense against the Republic and the principle of earned civic status.
Section 4. Conditions of Service
The Corps shall operate under conditions that reflect the authentic demands of public works:
(a) reasonable occupational safety standards shall apply, but no person shall be insulated from physical effort, environmental exposure, or the ordinary risks inherent in essential infrastructure labor;
(b) work schedules, locations, and tasks shall not be adjusted to provide preferential or cushioned pathways to civic qualification;
(c) the Corps shall not be deployed in a manner that displaces or undercuts private labor through coercion, underbidding, or unfair competition.
Section 5. Oversight and Anti-Capture Safeguards
(a) The organization, scope, eligibility criteria, and operational standards of the Construction Corps shall be prescribed by statute, consistent with this Article, Article III (Citizenship and Civic Duty), and Article XX-A (National Public Service Corps).
(b) The Constitutional Judicial Commission (CJC) shall certify annually that the Corps maintains genuine hardship and labor intensity, and shall investigate any credible allegation of dilution, favoritism, or displacement.
(c) Any lawful resident shall have standing to challenge violations or degradation of Corps standards before the Constitutional Review Court (CRC), with expedited review and broad discovery rights.
Section 6. Construction and Lock Protection
This Article shall be interpreted to:
(a) preserve the Construction Corps as a rigorous, non-negotiable pathway to civic recognition through real sacrifice and contribution;
(b) prevent its transformation into an administrative, credentialed, or politically manipulated program;
(c) protect private labor markets from displacement while channeling public works toward national resilience and human flourishing.
The core principles of this Article—including the requirement of direct manual labor, prohibition on substitution or dilution, and safeguards against displacement and capture—are lock-protected under Article XV and may not be repealed, suspended, diluted, reinterpreted, or circumvented except through the supermajority procedures specified therein.

Article XX-D — Board of Innocence and Corrective Justice
Charge
The Republic exists to secure justice, not merely finality. Wrongful convictions, fabrication or suppression of evidence, coerced confessions, corrupt inducements, and grossly disproportionate sentences undermine the legitimacy of law and the sovereignty of the People. The Board of Innocence and Corrective Justice is established as a permanent, independent constitutional body to investigate credible claims of substantial injustice in criminal adjudications, expose systemic causes of error or abuse, and compel lawful correction—serving truth and public legitimacy above institutional convenience or deference to erroneous outcomes.
Section 1. Establishment and Independence
There is hereby established the Board of Innocence and Corrective Justice as a permanent, coequal constitutional body.
The Board shall be independent of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, and shall not be subject to direction, supervision, or retaliation by any public official or entity.
Funding shall be appropriated directly by law at a level sufficient to fulfill its duties, insulated from discretionary reduction, and subject only to public audit under Article XXXIX.
Section 2. Jurisdiction
The Board shall have authority to investigate and report on:
(a) credible claims of factual innocence supported by new, material evidence (including but not limited to DNA, forensic re-analysis, recantations, or newly discovered witnesses);
(b) violations of due process or constitutional rights materially affecting conviction or sentence, including suppression of exculpatory evidence, fabrication or coaching of evidence/testimony, coercion, improper inducements to witnesses or informants, and use of unreliable forensic or identification procedures;
(c) sentences that are grossly disproportionate, arbitrary, or inconsistent with law, equity, or constitutional norms;
(d) patterns or practices of prosecutorial, judicial, law-enforcement, or administrative misconduct that systematically undermine the integrity of criminal adjudications;
(e) credible allegations of corruption, malice, or hostility to constitutional order by public servants in the performance of criminal justice functions.
Section 3. Powers
To fulfill its jurisdiction, the Board shall have authority to:
(a) issue subpoenas for records, testimony, and physical evidence, enforceable by the Constitutional Review Court (CRC);
(b) obtain access to sealed, restricted, classified, or otherwise protected case materials, subject only to narrowly tailored protective orders necessary to prevent imminent harm;
(c) commission independent forensic testing, expert review, or re-examination at public expense;
(d) receive petitions from any person, organization, court, or public official, and initiate investigations sua sponte upon credible evidence of substantial injustice;
(e) conduct hearings, interviews, and fact-finding proceedings, with full due process protections for all participants;
(f) commence investigation within sixty (60) days of a credible petition and conclude within twelve (12) months unless extended by written, public justification for extraordinary complexity or volume of evidence;
(g) protect petitioners, witnesses, and whistleblowers from retaliation pursuant to Article XI and Article I §10.
Section 4. Findings, Reports, and Mandatory Referral
Upon completion of an investigation, the Board shall issue a public report containing:
(a) findings of fact and conclusions regarding innocence, constitutional violations, disproportionate sentencing, or systemic misconduct;
(b) recommendations for corrective action, including referral for judicial relief, executive clemency, disciplinary proceedings, or legislative reform;
(c) identification of recurring causes of injustice (e.g., eyewitness misidentification, forensic error, informant abuse, prosecutorial overreach) and proposed reforms to prevent recurrence.
All reports shall be published in full, subject only to narrowly tailored redactions necessary to protect ongoing proceedings, victim privacy, or national security.
Where the Board finds substantial injustice or credible misconduct, it shall make mandatory referral to:
(a) the Constitutional Review Court for expedited review, potential vacatur, or other constitutional remedy;
(b) the Constitutional Judicial Commission for investigation of institutional or individual misconduct;
(c) the appropriate prosecuting authority for reconsideration or dismissal;
(d) the executive for clemency or pardon consideration;
(e) legislative bodies for statutory or procedural reform.
Receiving authorities shall acknowledge receipt within thirty (30) days and act in good faith; failure to do so constitutes a grave offense subject to CJC enforcement.
Section 5. Limitations
The Board shall not:
(a) adjudicate guilt or innocence;
(b) vacate convictions, alter sentences, order retrials, or grant release;
(c) exercise prosecutorial, judicial, or disciplinary authority;
(d) substitute its findings for judicial process.
The Board may not interfere with active judicial proceedings except in coordination with the court of jurisdiction.
The existence of Board action shall not delay or preclude any other remedy available under this Constitution.
Section 6. Composition and Safeguards
The Board shall consist of eleven (11) members serving staggered, non-renewable ten-year terms.
Composition shall ensure independence and competence:
(a) no more than three (3) members may have prior prosecutorial or law-enforcement careers;
(b) at least three (3) members shall be drawn from exonerees, defense attorneys, civil rights advocates, or forensic scientists with demonstrated expertise in wrongful-conviction matters;
(c) the remainder shall include retired judges, scholars of criminal justice, and other qualified individuals with no recent partisan or institutional affiliation.
Appointment shall be made by a balanced process involving the Supreme Court, CRC, CJC, and citizen lottery to prevent capture.
Members may be removed only for cause, by supermajority vote of the CRC upon CJC recommendation.
Section 7. Annual Reporting and Audit
The Board shall publish an annual public report detailing cases reviewed, findings, referrals, systemic patterns, reform recommendations, and performance metrics.
The Board and its operations shall be subject to independent performance and integrity audits every five (5) years by the CJC, with results made public.
Section 8. Construction and Lock Protection
This Article shall be construed broadly to favor correction of injustice, exposure of misconduct, and preservation of public legitimacy in the administration of justice, and narrowly against institutional secrecy, deference to finality, or protection of public servants at the expense of truth.
The existence, independence, core jurisdiction, mandatory referral duty, anti-retaliation protections, and composition safeguards of the Board are lock-protected under Article XV and may not be repealed, suspended, diluted, reinterpreted, defunded, or structurally altered except through the supermajority procedures specified therein.
Article XXI — Public Facilities and State Property
Charge 
The State holds public land and facilities in trust for the People—not as sovereign landlord, prestige project, or instrument of elite comfort. Accumulation, degradation, secrecy, or luxury in public property betrays stewardship and erodes legitimacy. This Article restrains state ownership to what is strictly necessary, proportionate, transparent, durable, and humane, while forbidding the use of public assets for privilege, concealment, or symbolic domination.
Section 1. Principle of Proportional Stewardship Public land, buildings, and facilities shall be acquired, retained, used, or disposed of solely for legitimate, demonstrable public purposes and in strict proportion to actual need. The State shall not: (a) accumulate or retain land, structures, or complexes grossly disproportionate to their lawful function or public benefit; (b) engage in speculative land banking, indefinite reservation, or acquisition “for future need” absent clear, evidence-based justification, legislative authorization, and periodic judicial review. Unused, excess, or unnecessary public property shall be disposed of, repurposed, or returned to private ownership consistent with law and public interest.
Section 2. Fitness, Safety, Human Dignity, and Durability All public facilities used for education, detention, adjudication, health care, administration, or public service shall meet baseline standards of safety, habitability, sanitation, and human dignity appropriate to their function. The Republic shall prioritize construction, renovation, and maintenance of durable, long-lived facilities designed for generational service using robust engineering and materials suited to resilience and civic permanence. Substandard, degrading, hazardous, or inhumane conditions shall not be justified by budget, convenience, emergency designation, or temporary status. No public function shall be conducted in facilities unfit for the humane treatment of persons subject to their use.
Section 3. Strict Prohibition of Luxury, Privilege, and Elite Use Public property and facilities shall not confer luxury, elite living conditions, personal privilege, status symbolism, or undue comfort upon officials, agents, contractors, or affiliates of the State. Residences, retreats, compounds, secure dwellings, protected offices, or other facilities maintained at public expense shall be limited to the minimum reasonably necessary for lawful public function and verifiable physical safety. Such facilities shall not resemble private estates, instruments of enrichment, vacation properties, or status rewards. Any claim of “security” or “operational necessity” justifying enhanced conditions shall be narrowly construed and subject to independent judicial review.
Section 4. Limits on Acquisition and Retention Acquisition or retention of public land or facilities beyond demonstrated operational need requires: (a) public justification supported by evidence; (b) legislative authorization; (c) periodic review every five (5) years. Excess or underutilized property shall be subject to disposition or repurposing; indefinite retention without active use constitutes waste and breach of stewardship.
Section 5. Lawful Use of Prison Labor for Public Works The use of lawfully convicted persons for public works is constitutionally permitted where it serves genuine public benefit and is consistent with human dignity, proportionality, and Article VII. Permitted labor includes: (a) construction, repair, renovation, and maintenance of durable public infrastructure and facilities; (b) disaster recovery, environmental remediation, and preservation of culturally or historically significant structures.
Such labor shall be: (a) real, productive, and contributing measurable public value; (b) subject to humane standards of safety, medical care, nutrition, rest, and proportionality; (c) governed by law with judicial oversight and periodic review.
Prison labor shall not be used for luxury projects, private enrichment, symbolic punishment, or conditions designed solely to inflict hardship without public benefit.
Section 6. Reuse and Recommissioning The Republic shall favor reopening, reusing, or recommissioning existing public facilities where they: (a) remain structurally viable or can be restored at reasonable cost; (b) meet current standards of safety, containment, habitability, and human dignity; (c) serve a legitimate public purpose. Reuse and restoration shall take precedence over new construction when consistent with stewardship, cost-effectiveness, and humane standards.
Section 6a. Temporary and Transitional Facilities Temporary or transitional facilities (modular structures, trailers, tents, or provisional housing) may be used only where reasonably necessary to address genuine emergencies, overcrowding, displacement, infrastructure failure, or rapid public operations. Such facilities shall: (a) meet baseline standards of safety, sanitation, habitability, and human dignity; (b) be strictly time-limited to the period of demonstrated necessity; (c) not serve as a permanent substitute for durable solutions where permanent facilities are reasonably achievable. Temporary designation shall not be used to evade constitutional obligations through neglect, delay, or indefinite extension. All temporary use shall be subject to expedited judicial review upon challenge.
Section 7. Due Process, Transparency, and Citizen Standing All acquisition, retention, use, reuse, or disposition of public land and facilities shall be subject to: (a) public justification and full disclosure of costs, need, and alternatives; (b) legislative authorization where required; (c) judicial review without deference to administrative claims of necessity or security; (d) broad citizen standing to challenge excess, waste, abuse, luxury, secrecy, or unlawful use before the Constitutional Review Court (CRC).
No claim of security, secrecy, continuity, or emergency shall exempt public property from these stewardship requirements.
Section 8. Oversight and Enforcement The Constitutional Judicial Commission (CJC) shall monitor compliance, certify stewardship standards annually, and investigate credible allegations of waste, privilege, or abuse. Violations of this Article constitute grave offenses, enforceable through injunctive relief, disgorgement of misused assets, personal liability for responsible officials, and other remedies as provided by law.
Section 9. Relationship to Other Articles This Article shall be construed in harmony with:
	•	Article VII (Crime, Justice, and Penal Philosophy);
	•	Article VIII series (Economic Structure, Worker Cooperatives, and Stewardship);
	•	Article IX (Land, Homesteading, and Agricultural Duty);
	•	Article XX series (Public Service and Administrative Structure);
	•	Article XXIV (Federal Law Enforcement and Use of State Force);
	•	Article XXXVI (Transition and Discontinuity of Power).
The State’s stewardship duties shall be at least as strict as those imposed upon private persons under Article IX.
Section 10. Construction and Lock Protection This Article shall be interpreted to: (a) restrain accumulation of state property by inertia, prestige, or secrecy; (b) prohibit use of public assets for elite privilege, concealment, or luxury; (c) favor modesty, necessity, transparency, durability, and human dignity over grandeur or domination; (d) permit lawful, productive prison labor for real public works while forbidding abuse or symbolic punishment; (e) prioritize reuse and restoration of existing facilities over unnecessary new construction.
The core principles of proportional stewardship, prohibition of luxury/privilege, humane standards, anti-waste disposition requirements, and citizen standing are lock-protected under Article XV and may not be repealed, suspended, diluted, or reinterpreted except through supermajority procedures.


ARTICLE XXII — BODILY AUTONOMY, FAMILY, AND CHILD REARING

Charge

This Article establishes constitutional protections governing bodily autonomy, family formation, fertility, and the upbringing of children within the Republic. All public authority exercised in these domains shall be construed narrowly and solely to protect individual rights, parental authority, and family integrity against coercion, undue interference, or compelled conformity.

Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to authorize governmental control, direction, or substitution of judgment over personal bodily decisions, lawful family life, or the upbringing of children, except as expressly permitted by law, supported by clear and convincing evidence, and consistent with constitutional limits.

Section 1. Bodily Autonomy

Every person possesses an inherent right to bodily autonomy.

No person shall be compelled by the State to undergo medical treatment, bodily alteration, sterilization, experimentation, or biological intervention without free and informed consent, except where narrowly necessary to prevent imminent and grave harm to others and subject to due process and judicial review.

Bodily autonomy shall not be abridged through direct or indirect coercion, including denial of employment, travel, education, benefits, legal status, or civil participation, except where expressly authorized by this Constitution and supported by clear and convincing evidence of necessity.

Section 2. Pregnancy, Reproductive Decisions, and Non-Coercion

Decisions concerning pregnancy, reproduction, contraception, sterilization, and related medical care implicate profound interests of bodily autonomy, moral conscience, family integrity, and personal responsibility.

The Republic shall neither compel nor prohibit reproductive outcomes through coercion, penalty, threat, or inducement, nor condition civil rights or legal status upon reproductive choices, fertility status, or pregnancy outcomes.

No public authority shall treat pregnancy or pregnancy termination as presumptive criminal conduct. Any regulation of pregnancy or abortion shall be civil in character unless individualized proof establishes criminal intent independent of the pregnancy itself.

Voluntary sterilization by competent adults shall be a protected personal choice. The State shall not prohibit, compel, or penalize such decisions. Public funding for elective sterilization or elective pregnancy termination shall not occur except where expressly authorized by law.

Section 3. Family Formation and Fertility

The right to form a family, to marry or not marry, and to decide whether and when to bear children belongs to the People and shall not be dictated by the State.

The Republic shall neither compel nor prohibit reproduction, sterilization, contraception, or fertility decisions, nor condition civil rights, benefits, or legal standing upon such choices.

Public funding, subsidy, or sponsorship of fertility, reproduction, or family formation shall not occur except where expressly authorized by law to address demonstrable crisis conditions threatening the survival or basic functioning of the Republic, and only for the duration and scope strictly necessary to address such conditions.

Section 4. Parental Authority and Child Rearing

Parents or lawful guardians possess the primary right and duty to direct the upbringing, education, moral formation, medical care, and lawful discipline of their children.

The State shall not supplant, override, or interfere with parental authority absent clear and convincing evidence, after due process and judicial determination, of abuse, neglect, or imminent and specific danger to the child.

Child rearing shall not be used as a vehicle for ideological enforcement, demographic engineering, social experimentation, or substitution of state judgment for parental conscience.

Section 5. Limits on State Intervention

The Republic may act to protect children or other vulnerable persons only where necessary to prevent serious and specific harm. Any such intervention shall be:

a. narrowly tailored to the individualized risk;
b. proportionate to the harm sought to be prevented;
c. subject to prompt judicial oversight and periodic review;
d. terminated immediately upon resolution of the risk.

No general presumption of parental unfitness shall exist, and no class-based, belief-based, or status-based standard shall substitute for individualized proof.

Section 6. Non-Discrimination and Equal Protection

No person or family shall be discriminated against, penalized, or deprived of rights or opportunities on the basis of lawful family structure, fertility status, pregnancy outcome, number of children, sterilization status, or parental choices, except where necessary to protect the rights and safety of others and supported by clear and convincing evidence.

Section 7. Construction

This Article shall be interpreted to:

a. favor personal responsibility over state control;
b. preserve the primacy of family, conscience, and informed consent in human formation;
c. forbid direct or indirect coercion of bodily, reproductive, or parental decisions in any direction;
d. require individualized proof and strict scrutiny for any state intrusion into pregnancy, child rearing, or bodily autonomy;
e. harmonize with Article XXVI (Charter of Inviolable Rights) and Article XXXVIII (Disaster Response), without permitting emergency, crisis, or public-health claims to dissolve these protections.

Section 8. Status

This Article is unlocked and subject to amendment pursuant to Article XV.

Article XXIII — Mutual Republican Defense and Cooperative Alignment

Charge

This Article establishes constitutional principles governing collective defense, international cooperation, and alignment with foreign states by the Republic. All cooperative defense and foreign alignment shall be undertaken solely for the protection of the People, the preservation of constitutional self-government, and the defense of lawful sovereignty, and shall be exercised transparently and pursuant to constitutional authorization. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to authorize imperial control, covert intervention, proxy warfare, or binding foreign entanglements inconsistent with democratic accountability and constitutional limits.


Section 1. Principles of External Alignment

a. Non-Imperial Doctrine
The Republic shall not pursue empire, territorial expansion, vassalage, or indirect domination of foreign peoples.

No foreign policy objective shall justify:
	•	permanent occupation without consent;
	•	covert control of another nation’s institutions;
	•	economic subjugation or dependency engineering;
	•	regime engineering by force, deception, or proxy action.

b. Sovereign Equality
All nations are equal in dignity, regardless of size, power, wealth, or internal system of governance.
Cooperation with a foreign nation does not constitute endorsement of its internal political structure.

c. Defensive Orientation
External alignment shall be defensive in nature and limited to purposes of:
	•	protecting the Republic and its People;
	•	preventing regional instability that poses a direct and material threat to the Republic;
	•	deterring aggression against peoples lawfully pursuing self-determination.

d. No Ideological Export
The Republic shall not seek to export ideology, doctrine, political systems, or cultural models through force, coercion, or inducement.
Assistance and cooperation shall respect the right of foreign peoples to determine their own political character.

e. Transparency and Accountability
All exercises of authority under this Article are subject to transparency, recordkeeping, and public accountability consistent with this Constitution.
Claims of foreign policy necessity shall not defeat constitutional limits.

Section 2. Sovereignty of Lawful Expression

a. Territorial Legal Sovereignty
Expression, publication, association, and dissemination of information that are lawful under the Constitution and laws of the Republic shall not be restricted, penalized, or suppressed at the demand of any foreign state, authority, institution, or proxy.

Lawfulness within the territory of the Republic shall be determined solely by the constitutional and statutory law of the Republic.

b. Prohibition on Extraterritorial Censorship
The Republic shall not recognize, enforce, assist, or give effect to any foreign law, judgment, regulation, fine, penalty, or demand that seeks to censor, compel, punish, or condition expression or information that is lawful within the Republic.

Technical feasibility of compliance, including geoblocking or localized suppression, shall not create an obligation to comply with foreign censorship demands.

c. Determination of Foreign Coercion
A foreign demand shall be deemed coercive where it seeks, through threat, penalty, exclusion, retaliation, or conditional access, to alter lawful expression or conduct within the Republic.

Determinations under this Section shall be subject to legislative oversight and judicial review.

d. Protection of Lawful Domestic Actors
The Republic shall defend, through lawful diplomatic, legal, and economic means, any person, entity, platform, or organization operating lawfully within its jurisdiction against foreign coercion or punitive action arising solely from lawful expression or conduct.

Defense under this Section includes, but is not limited to:
	•	diplomatic protest and formal objection;
	•	refusal of enforcement or recognition;
	•	reciprocal legal or economic countermeasures authorized by law;
	•	support for lawful domestic judicial proceedings challenging foreign penalties.

e. No Compelled Foreign Compliance
No domestic actor shall be required, as a condition of lawful operation within the Republic, to comply with foreign censorship regimes, speech codes, ideological restrictions, or informational controls that conflict with constitutional protections.

Self-censorship undertaken solely to satisfy foreign demands shall not be compelled, incentivized, or enforced by the Republic.

f. Proportional and Accountable Response
Responses under this Section shall be proportionate to the coercive action and shall be documented, transparent, and subject to legislative review.

Major retaliatory or economic measures require legislative authorization.

g. Personal Accountability of Foreign Actors
Foreign officials or agents responsible for unlawful censorship demands directed at lawful expression within the Republic may be subject to proportionate consequences, including denial of entry, restriction of privileges, or other lawful measures authorized by the Legislature.

h. Federal and Subnational Alignment
Subnational governments may enact complementary measures consistent with this Section to prevent enforcement of foreign censorship within their jurisdiction.

i. No Extraterritorial Assertion
Nothing in this Section shall be construed to regulate lawful expression within foreign jurisdictions or to compel foreign states to adopt the Republic’s standards of speech.

This Section exists to defend sovereignty, not to impose it.

Section 3. Cooperative Defense Agreements

a. Mutual Defense Only
The Republic may enter cooperative or mutual defense agreements with foreign states or associations solely for defensive purposes.
Such agreements shall exist to deter aggression, respond to armed attack, or address concrete threats to the safety of the Republic and its People.

b. Public Disclosure and Authorization
No cooperative defense agreement shall have force or effect unless:
	•	the full text is publicly disclosed;
	•	legislative approval is obtained prior to ratification;
	•	obligations, commitments, and limitations are clearly stated.

Secret treaties, undisclosed annexes, and informal security commitments are prohibited.

c. Limited and Defined Scope
All cooperative defense agreements shall specify, at minimum:
	•	geographic scope;
	•	duration and renewal conditions;
	•	command and control authority;
	•	limits on forces, resources, and operations;
	•	civilian oversight mechanisms.

Open-ended, indefinite, or geographically unbounded commitments are prohibited.

d. No Automatic War Obligation
No treaty, agreement, or alliance may compel the Republic to enter armed conflict without separate constitutional authorization.
Defense cooperation shall not substitute for the constitutional war powers of the Republic.

e. Prohibition on Offensive Mandates
The Republic shall not be bound by any agreement requiring participation in offensive war, regime change, coercive intervention, or military action undertaken for ideological, economic, or political objectives unrelated to direct defense.

f. Right of Withdrawal
The Republic retains the unconditional right to suspend or withdraw from any cooperative defense agreement upon legislative determination that the agreement:
	•	exceeds defensive purpose;
	•	compromises constitutional principles;
	•	exposes the Republic to unjustified risk;
	•	facilitates imperial drift or covert entanglement.

Withdrawal decisions and their justification shall be publicly disclosed.
g. Legitimacy Determination
Determinations of popular support and legitimate control shall be based on verifiable evidence and transparent criteria, including third-party monitoring or independent observation by non-aligned republics or credible neutral bodies where practicable, and shall be subject to legislative review.
h. Transparency of Implementation
All actions taken pursuant to cooperative defense agreements shall be documented, recorded, and subject to public and legislative oversight consistent with this Constitution.
Operational secrecy shall be limited strictly to immediate tactical necessity and shall not conceal the existence, scope, or legal basis of commitments.

Section 4. Assistance to Emerging or Reconstituting Republics

a. Eligibility for Assistance
The Republic may provide material, advisory, humanitarian, defensive, or reconstruction assistance to a foreign nation or people only where:
	•	the initiative for assistance originates domestically within the affected territory;
	•	popular support is demonstrated through transparent, verifiable means;
	•	the requesting authority exercises effective and legitimate control over the territory it claims to govern;
	•	assistance is openly requested and publicly acknowledged.

Eligibility determinations require legislative authorization and are subject to judicial review.

b. Presumption and Rebuttal of Legitimacy
Popular support and legitimate control shall be presumed absent clear and convincing evidence of fraud, coercion, suppression of opposition, or systemic manipulation.
The burden of rebuttal rests on the party asserting illegitimacy.

c. Conditional Assistance
Any assistance provided under this Section shall be conditional upon:
	•	adoption or restoration of a constitutional framework providing:
a. rule of law;
b. separation of powers;
c. protection of fundamental liberties;
d. civilian control of armed forces;
e. prohibition of corruption and parallel power structures;
	•	transparent use of aid and resources;
	•	independent auditing of assistance;
	•	defined timelines toward self-governance.

The Republic shall not fund, construct, or entrench tyranny.

d. No Mandatory Imitation
Assisted nations are not required to replicate the form of this Constitution.
They must, however, adhere in substance to republican governance, accountability, and popular sovereignty.
e. Automatic Suspension and Review
Suspension of assistance, advisory presence, or defense commitments shall be automatic upon a legislative finding by simple majority or upon confirmation by an independent audit that a triggering violation has occurred.
All active assistance programs shall be subject to mandatory review at least quarterly.

f. No Covert Assistance
All assistance under this Section shall be provided openly and lawfully.
Covert funding, intelligence operations, information warfare, or indirect manipulation are prohibited.

g. Periodic Review
All assistance programs are subject to periodic legislative review to determine continued eligibility, compliance, and alignment with constitutional principles.

Article XXIII — Mutual Republican Defense and Cooperative Alignment

a. Absolute Prohibitions
No branch, agency, officer, or instrumentality of the Republic may:
	•	orchestrate coups or unlawful seizures of power;
	•	manipulate or subvert foreign elections or referenda;
	•	finance, train, direct, or coordinate foreign opposition movements covertly;
	•	engineer economic collapse, scarcity, or dependency to coerce political outcomes;
	•	destabilize governments for strategic, ideological, or economic gain;
	•	conduct or sponsor so-called “color revolutions” under any pretext.

Such acts constitute grave violations of constitutional duty.

b. Intelligence Restraint
Intelligence activities related to foreign nations shall be limited strictly to defensive information gathering necessary to protect the Republic.
Defensive intelligence gathering shall not include funding, training, directing, advising, or materially supporting foreign political actors, parties, movements, militias, media organizations, or civil institutions.

c. No Independent Foreign Policy
No intelligence or security body may conduct, direct, or substitute its own foreign policy for that lawfully determined by the constitutional branches.
Operations undertaken absent legislative authorization are void.

d. No Proxy Warfare
The Republic shall not wage war, conduct hostilities, or pursue strategic objectives through proxy forces, mercenary groups, private military contractors, or deniable intermediaries.

e. Consequences
Any agency or instrumentality that violates this Section acts against the constitutional order of the Republic.
Such violation warrants termination of the offending operation and subjects responsible individuals to removal and liability as provided by law.

Section 6. Private Foreign Activity and Non-Attribution

a. Private Action Distinguished
Nothing in this Article shall be construed to prohibit citizens, residents, or private organizations not acting on behalf of the Republic from engaging in lawful speech, association, advocacy, humanitarian activity, or political activity abroad in their personal or private capacity.

b. No State Attribution or Authority
Private foreign activity shall not be attributed to the Republic absent clear evidence of authorization, direction, funding, coordination, or material support by the Republic or its agents.
No private person or organization may claim to act on behalf of the Republic without explicit lawful authorization.

c. Assumption of Foreign Jurisdiction and Risk
Any person or organization engaging in private activity abroad does so subject to the laws, risks, and jurisdiction of the foreign territory in which such activity occurs.
No expectation of protection, assistance, or intervention by the Republic shall arise from private foreign activity.

d. Prohibition on Proxy Conduct
Private activity shall not be used to evade the prohibitions of this Article.
Any private conduct undertaken at the direction, encouragement, coordination, or material support of the Republic constitutes state action and is subject to all constitutional restrictions herein.

e. Extraordinary Diplomatic Discretion
Nothing in this Section prohibits the Republic from offering diplomatic assistance under extraordinary circumstances involving grave injustice, denial of due process, or threats to life, provided that such assistance does not legitimize or assume responsibility for the private conduct at issue.
f. Attribution of State Action
Clear evidence of material support, direction, coordination, or substantial assistance by the Republic to private persons or entities acting abroad constitutes state action under this Article, regardless of formal designation or intermediary use.
High-risk private foreign political or military assistance may be subject to registration or notification requirements as provided by law.


Section 7. Economic and Trade Cooperation

a. Fair Trade Doctrine
Trade and economic agreements entered into by the Republic shall:
	•	be publicly disclosed and subject to legislative approval;

	•	prohibit resource extraction, labor exploitation, or market access obtained through force, deception, or political coercion.

b. No Economic Justification for Tyranny
No alliance, aid program, trade agreement, or economic intervention may be justified by:
	•	commodity pricing;
	•	market stabilization;
	•	access to natural resources;
	•	corporate profit;
	•	financial speculation or systemic risk.

Economic convenience shall never excuse oppression, domination, or the subversion of popular sovereignty.

c. Transparency of Economic Alignment
All economic cooperation under this Article shall be documented, recorded, and subject to public and legislative review.
Secret trade commitments, undisclosed concessions, or informal economic guarantees are prohibited.

d. Right of Termination
The Republic retains the right to suspend or terminate economic cooperation where a participating entity engages in systemic corruption, coercion, or violations of human dignity inconsistent with republican principles.
e. Humanitarian assistance
Humanitarian assistance intended solely to prevent loss of life shall not be construed as political alignment, but shall not be used to influence governance, elections, or accession decisions.

Section 8. Republican Volunteers

a. Voluntary Assistance
Citizens and lawful residents of the Republic may voluntarily assist foreign peoples pursuing lawful self-determination, provided that such assistance:
	•	is undertaken openly and without deception;
	•	involves no coercion, force, or fraud;
	•	is not directed, funded, coordinated, or encouraged by any branch, agency, or instrumentality of the Republic;
	•	complies with the Constitution and laws of the Republic and does not constitute mercenarism, proxy warfare, or coercive force undertaken for compensation or state advantage;

b. Transparency and Notification
Voluntary assistance under this Section shall be subject to reasonable notification or registration requirements as established by law, solely for purposes of transparency and non-attribution.
Such requirements shall not constitute licensing, approval, or direction of private activity.

c. No Mercenarism or Proxy Forces
The Republic shall not sponsor, organize, fund, equip, or direct mercenary forces, private military contractors, or proxy armies.
Private armed activity undertaken for compensation or strategic effect is prohibited absent explicit legislative authorization.

d. No State Responsibility
Private voluntary assistance does not create any obligation, endorsement, or responsibility on the part of the Republic.
No claim of state protection, indemnification, or intervention shall arise from such activity.

e. Liability and Accountability
Persons acting under this Section bear full personal responsibility for their actions.
Nothing in this Section limits civil or criminal liability arising under domestic or foreign law.
f. Legitimacy and Foreign Criminalization

Criminalization of political dissent, republican advocacy, or nonviolent resistance by a foreign regime shall not, by itself, render private assistance illegitimate under this Article.

Nothing in this Section shall be construed to authorize private acts of terrorism, indiscriminate violence, or armed force undertaken for hire, profit, or strategic control.


Section 9. Oversight and Transparency

a. Legislative Authority
All foreign assistance, defense commitments, economic cooperation, and alignment undertaken pursuant to this Article require legislative authorization as provided by law.

b. Public Record
All actions taken under this Article shall be documented, preserved, and archived as public records.
The existence, scope, legal basis, and duration of such actions shall be subject to public disclosure, except where temporary nondisclosure is strictly necessary to address an immediate and concrete security risk.

c. Limited Operational Secrecy
Operational details may be withheld only where disclosure would pose an imminent risk to life, ongoing defensive operations, or the safety of persons.
Such nondisclosure shall be narrowly tailored, time-limited, and subject to subsequent public disclosure and legislative review.

d. No Informal or Undeclared Commitments
No branch, agency, or official of the Republic may create binding foreign obligations, security guarantees, or alignment commitments through informal understandings, executive assurances, or undisclosed arrangements.

e. Periodic Review
All active agreements, assistance programs, and cooperative actions under this Article shall be subject to periodic legislative review to determine continued necessity, compliance with constitutional principles, and alignment with the interests of the Republic.

f. Accountability for Concealment
Knowing concealment, misrepresentation, or omission of material facts relating to foreign alignment, assistance, or defense commitments constitutes a breach of constitutional duty and is subject to liability as provided by law.

Section 10. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to preserve the Republic as a non-imperial power, to restrain covert and unaccountable foreign entanglements, and to ensure that external action serves the safety, liberty, and constitutional integrity of the People.

a. Presumption Against Empire
Any ambiguity in the interpretation of this Article shall be resolved against imperial expansion, indirect domination, or permanent foreign entanglement.

Where conflict arises, the interpretation that most restrains abuse of power and preserves republican self-government shall prevail.

Formal compliance that defeats the purpose of this Article constitutes violation.
Foreign policy actions structured to evade disclosure, authorization, or accountability are prohibited.

f. Self-Execution
This Article is self-executing in all its parts.
Failure of legislative or executive implementation shall not delay or diminish its force.

Section 11. Voluntary Accession to the Union

a. Right of Accession
Any foreign state, territory, or political entity may petition to join the Union of the Republic, in whole or in part, provided that:
	•	the petition is initiated by lawful authorities of that territory;
	•	popular consent is demonstrated through transparent, verifiable means;
	•	the territory agrees to submit fully to the Constitution of the Republic;
	•	all parallel sovereignties, militias, and legal systems are dissolved;
	•	allegiance to the Republic is exclusive and permanent.

Union is a covenant, not a convenience.

b. Campaigning for Union
The Republic may openly advocate, diplomatically encourage, and publicly promote accession to the Union through lawful means, including:
	•	diplomacy;
	•	trade incentives;
	•	cultural exchange;
	•	informational outreach;
	•	lawful political discourse.

Coercion, subversion, deception, or covert manipulation to induce accession is forbidden.

c. Congressional Authority
Accession requires approval by a supermajority of the Legislature and the adoption of a public accession charter defining:
	•	transitional governance arrangements;
	•	rights and obligations of the acceding population;
	•	citizenship pathways and eligibility criteria;
	•	integration timelines;
	•	security and defense arrangements.

No accession shall be rushed, concealed, or effected by executive action alone.
d. Permanence of Union

Accession to the Union constitutes permanent and irrevocable membership.

No state, territory, or political entity may secede, withdraw, dissolve its obligations, or claim a right of exit from the Republic except by constitutional amendment duly adopted or by the outcome of declared war.

Union is a covenant among peoples.
Disagreement does not dissolve it.

e. Judicial Review
Accession proceedings are subject to judicial review to ensure compliance with constitutional requirements, protection of fundamental rights, and the absence of coercion or fraud.

Section 12. Integration and Citizenship Risk Acknowledgment

a. Conscious Acceptance of Risk
The Republic acknowledges that voluntary accession necessarily entails the integration of new populations and the extension of rights, protections, and civic pathways.

Such integration carries inherent risk and responsibility, which shall not be used as a pretext to deny lawful accession once granted.

Yesterday Iberia; today Rome.

b. Transitional Status
Newly acceded territories may be governed under transitional administration for a defined and limited period, during which:
	•	civic education in constitutional principles is mandatory;
	•	institutional reform and harmonization are completed;
	•	eligibility for citizenship is phased according to law;
	•	hostile actors, parallel power structures, and unlawful militias are removed or prosecuted.

No permanent second-class status shall exist.

c. Equal Law Upon Completion
Upon completion of integration, all eligible residents of the acceded territory shall stand equal under the law, subject to the same duties, rights, and privileges as all other citizens of the Republic.

Discrimination, exclusion, or unequal status based on origin of accession is prohibited.

Section 13. Conquest in Defense of the Republic

a. Reserved Right of Conquest
Where a foreign territory:
	•	hosts a direct and material military threat to the Republic;
	•	facilitates overt or covert attacks against the Republic or its People;
	•	harbors forces, weapons, or infrastructure aimed at the Republic;
	•	engages in sustained hostile action after clear warning and demand for cessation;

the Republic reserves the right to use decisive military force, including conquest, solely to eliminate the threat.

Self-preservation is not imperialism.

b. Determination of Existential Threat
A determination that a foreign territory constitutes an existential threat requires:
	•	clear and convincing evidence;
	•	legislative authorization;
	•	public declaration of cause;
	•	judicial review of justification where practicable.

Economic inconvenience, ideological hostility, diplomatic friction, or speculative risk shall never suffice.

c. Limits on Authority Over Conquered Territory
Upon lawful conquest, the Republic shall possess authority only to the extent necessary to neutralize the threat and secure its People.

The Republic shall not claim permanent territorial sovereignty, annexation, or dominion over conquered territory unless the territory voluntarily petitions for accession pursuant to Section 11.

d. Permissible Post-Conquest Dispositions
Following neutralization of the threat, the Republic may, as determined by law:
	•	withdraw after securing demilitarization;
	•	establish a temporary civil administration with a fixed exit timetable;
	•	facilitate the formation of a reformed sovereign government;
	•	permanently demilitarize the territory;
	•	abandon the territory once the threat is eliminated.

No obligation exists to rebuild, occupy, or subsidize a hostile land beyond the security needs of the Republic.

e. No Automatic Citizenship
Conquest does not confer citizenship, residency, or political rights.
Eligibility for citizenship shall be determined solely under constitutional standards and transitional governance provisions.

f. Prohibition on Profit-Driven War
No military action or conquest may be undertaken:
	•	for resource acquisition;
	•	for corporate or private gain;
	•	to stabilize markets or currencies;
	•	to enrich arms industries;
	•	to launder public funds or authority.
	• 

Such actions constitute grave violations of constitutional duty.

g. Final Authority and Restraint
All decisions regarding conquered territory shall prioritize:
	•	safety of the People;
	•	long-term security of the Republic;
	•	constitutional integrity;
	•	avoidance of imperial entanglement.

The Republic conquers only to end threats, not to rule the unwilling. Conquest confers no permanent territorial claim, title, or right of annexation absent voluntary accession pursuant to Section 11, and shall never be undertaken for economic advantage, resource acquisition, or strategic exploitation.

Section 14. Post-Conquest Political Self-Determination

a. No Mandatory Political Reconstruction
The Republic shall not compel the adoption of its constitutional form, institutions, or political culture upon a conquered territory beyond what is strictly necessary to neutralize the threat and restore civil order.

Stabilization does not imply transformation.

b. Voluntary Determination of Political Future
Following the cessation of hostilities and restoration of basic security, the political future of a conquered territory shall be determined by its people through voluntary, transparent, and verifiable means.

No political outcome shall be presumed by virtue of conquest.

c. Option of Accession
Where a conquered territory demonstrates the capacity and desire for republican self-government, it may, after a period of stabilization, petition to join the Union pursuant to Section 11.

Accession shall require the freely expressed consent of the governed and shall not be induced by coercion, deprivation, threat, or continued military presence.

d. Option of Independent Governance
A conquered territory may elect to constitute itself as an independent sovereign government compatible with peaceful relations and security obligations, without obligation to accede to the Union.

The Republic shall not withhold withdrawal or assistance solely to influence this choice.

e. No Forced Alignment
The Republic shall not retain military, economic, or administrative control for the purpose of compelling accession, political imitation, ideological conformity, or permanent dependency.

f. Civic Determination and Eligibility Standards
Where a conquered territory proceeds to determine its political status under this Section, the Republic may require that such determination be conducted by an electorate meeting minimum civic standards consistent with republican self-government.

Such standards may include, by law:
	•	independence from armed groups, militias, or coercive authority;
	•	capacity to participate without intimidation, exclusion, or fraud;
	•	freedom from foreign allegiance or parallel sovereignty.

Eligibility standards shall be applied neutrally and shall not be based on race, ethnicity, religion, sex, or political belief.

These standards exist to ensure legitimate self-determination, not to entrench control, and shall dissolve upon accession to the Union or establishment of an independent sovereign government.

g. Equal Civic Voice and Corrective Safeguards
The Republic shall require the full and equal participation of women in any political determination conducted under this Section.

Where women, and other groups historically subjected to systemic exclusion from civic participation have been historically or systemically excluded, coerced, or prevented from political participation, the Republic shall mandate temporary corrective safeguards sufficient to ensure their voices are freely expressed and meaningfully counted.

Corrective safeguards may include protected voting processes, access to civic education and information, security against intimidation or retaliation, and participation thresholds preventing structural suppression.

No political determination shall be deemed legitimate under this Article if it reflects the exclusion or silencing of women.

h. Transitional Participation and Civic Development
Temporary participation in political determination under this Section shall not be construed as conferring citizenship, governing authority, or permanent civic qualification.

The purpose of transitional administration and participation is to expand civic capacity and eligibility among the population, not to permanently restrict participation or entrench exclusion.


Article XXIV — Federal Law Enforcement and the Use of State Force
Charge
Force is the most dangerous power entrusted to a Republic.
When law enforcement forgets that it exists to protect the People rather than rule them, liberty dies quietly, behind badges and sealed orders.
Free nations do not fall first to invasion, but to normalization of coercion: militarized agencies, secret authorities, rolling emergencies, and enforcement bodies that answer upward rather than outward.
This Article affirms that all state force is exceptional, limited, transparent, and subordinate to civil authority and individual rights. The federal government may enforce the law, but it shall never dominate the People, replace the states, or operate beyond democratic constraint.
Section 1. Principle of Limited and Accountable Force
a. Force as Last Resort
The use of physical force by the federal government is lawful only when strictly necessary to enforce constitutional law, protect life, or prevent grave and imminent harm. Convenience, expediency, or administrative efficiency shall never justify force.
b. Civil Supremacy
All federal law enforcement exists to serve civilian governance and constitutional law. No enforcement body shall act as an independent power center, political instrument, or sovereign authority.
c. Individual Accountability
No officer, agent, or contractor is exempt from personal legal responsibility for unlawful acts, even when acting under orders, policies, or classified directives.
Section 2. Scope and Limits of Federal Law Enforcement Authority
a. Enumerated Jurisdiction Only
Federal law enforcement authority is limited to:
	•	Enforcement of federal criminal law expressly enacted by the legislature
	•	Protection of federal courts, officials, and constitutional processes
	•	Interstate or international crimes whose scope, scale, or multi-jurisdictional complexity renders enforcement by individual states impracticable, as demonstrated by specific factual findings subject to judicial review
	•	Matters explicitly delegated to the federal government by this Constitution
Mere resource limitations, policy disagreement, or administrative convenience shall not constitute incapacity.
Federal enforcement may supersede state authority only where state incapacity is documented, contemporaneously justified, and subject to independent judicial review.
b. No General Police Power
The federal government shall possess no general police power over the People. Federal agencies shall not patrol, investigate, detain, or enforce absent a clear constitutional or statutory basis.
c. Anti-Pretext Enforcement
Federal jurisdiction shall not be expanded through creative interpretation, administrative rulemaking, data aggregation, or joint task forces designed to bypass state authority or constitutional limits.
Section 3. Prohibition of Federal Militarization
a. Civilian Character Mandate
Federal law enforcement agencies shall remain civilian in nature. Military weapons, tactics, vehicles, and command structures are prohibited except in narrowly defined emergency circumstances authorized by law.
b. Restricted Equipment
The routine use or stockpiling of battlefield weapons, armored vehicles, crowd-control chemical agents, or military surveillance systems by federal law enforcement is prohibited.
c. No Standing Domestic Occupation Force
The federal government shall not maintain standing forces designed for continuous domestic population control, mass protest suppression, or indefinite internal security operations.
Section 4. Use of Force Standards
a. Necessity and Proportionality
Any use of force must be strictly necessary and proportionate to the immediate threat. Deadly force is lawful only to prevent imminent loss of life or catastrophic harm.
b. Affirmative Duty to De-Escalate
Federal officers have a constitutional duty to attempt de-escalation when feasible. Failure to do so constitutes a violation of this Article.
c. Duty to Intervene
Any officer who witnesses unlawful or excessive force by another officer has an affirmative duty to intervene and to report the violation.
Section 4a. Distinction Between Arrest and Protective Containment
Arrest constitutes a criminal seizure undertaken for purposes of prosecution.
Protective containment constitutes a temporary, preventive restraint undertaken solely to prevent imminent serious harm arising from temporary incapacity.

Protective containment shall not initiate criminal proceedings, toll statutes of limitation, create criminal records, or substitute for arrest where probable cause of a completed offense exists.

Section 5. Transparency, Records, and Surveillance Constraints
a. No Secret Policing
No federal law enforcement body may operate secret detention facilities, undisclosed enforcement programs, or classified legal interpretations that affect the rights of the People.
b. Public Reporting
All federal agencies exercising enforcement authority shall publish regular, auditable reports detailing:
	•	Arrests and detentions
	•	Use-of-force incidents
	•	Surveillance activities authorized and denied
	•	Complaints, disciplinary actions, and prosecutions of officers
c. Body and Event Recording
When feasible, enforcement actions shall be recorded. Destruction, suppression, or tampering with such records constitutes a felony.
d. Surveillance as Precursor to Force
Domestic surveillance conducted for the purpose of enabling enforcement action shall be subject to the same constitutional standards, transparency requirements, and judicial oversight as the use of force itself.
Intelligence collection shall not be used to circumvent the protections of this Article.
Section 6. Prohibition of Secret Courts and Emergency Abuse
a. No Unreviewable Warrants or Orders
All warrants, subpoenas, and enforcement orders must be subject to independent judicial review. Secret courts issuing binding orders without adversarial process are prohibited.
b. Absolute Limits on Emergency Authority
No emergency enforcement authority may be renewed, reissued, or extended beyond its initial statutory term.
Any subsequent emergency authorization addressing substantially similar conditions shall require:
	•	A fresh legislative enactment by supermajority vote
	•	Public findings of necessity
	•	Independent judicial review
Rolling, continuous, or functionally identical emergency declarations are prohibited.
Secret courts issuing binding orders without meaningful judicial oversight, recorded reasoning, and post-hoc review are prohibited.
Section 7. Interagency Conduct and Task Forces
a. No Jurisdiction Laundering
Joint task forces shall not be used to circumvent constitutional protections, state law, or statutory limits by delegating prohibited actions to another agency.
Evidence obtained through joint operations that would have been unlawful if conducted directly by federal officers shall be inadmissible in all proceedings, and no intergovernmental agreement may cure such violation.
b. Clear Command Responsibility
Every joint operation must identify a single accountable commanding authority. Diffusion of responsibility shall not shield misconduct.
Section 8. Prohibition of Political Policing
a. Viewpoint Neutrality
Federal law enforcement shall not investigate, surveil, or target individuals or groups based on political belief, speech, association, religion, or lawful dissent.
b. No Enforcement for Political Advantage
The use of federal enforcement power to influence elections, suppress opposition, protect incumbents, or retaliate against critics is a constitutional violation.
Section 9. Remedies and Enforcement
a. Private Right of Action
Any person who suffers concrete injury, deprivation of rights, or unlawful coercion as a result of a violation of this Article has a direct right to bring civil and criminal action against responsible officers, supervisors, and agencies.
b. No Qualified Immunity
Qualified immunity shall not shield federal officers or agents from liability for constitutional violations.
c. Jurisdiction, Venue, and Waiver of Immunity
The United States expressly waives sovereign immunity for all claims arising under this Article.
Actions may be brought in any federal district where the violation occurred or where the plaintiff resides or, where justice so requires, where a substantial part of the unlawful conduct occurred.
No doctrine of abstention, exhaustion, deference, or political question shall bar adjudication of claims under this Article.
d. Exclusionary Rule
Evidence obtained in violation of this Article is inadmissible in any proceeding.
Section 10. Non-Delegation and Contractors
a. No Outsourced Coercion
The federal government shall not delegate law enforcement or coercive authority to private contractors, corporations, or foreign entities.
b. Color of Federal Authority
Any person acting under color of federal authority, including contractors, subcontractors, private prison personnel, corporate security, or temporary agents, shall be subject to the same constitutional duties, prohibitions, and liabilities as sworn federal officers.
Section 11. Supremacy of This Article
Federal enforcement authority shall be exercised subject to the limitations and State safeguards set forth in Article XXVIII-A, which governs nullification, anti-coercion, and State interposition. This Article binds all branches, agencies, and officers of the federal government. No statute, regulation, executive order, treaty, or classification may override its provisions.
Section 12. Construction
This Article shall be construed broadly in favor of liberty, transparency, and restraint, and narrowly against unchecked force, secrecy, and consolidation of power.

All federal law enforcement authority exercised pursuant to this Article is subject to the constraints, prohibitions, accountability mechanisms, and dissolution provisions set forth in Article XXX — Federal Enforcement Authority, Accountability, and Civic Restraint, which shall be construed as complementary, controlling where applicable, and binding regardless of the statutory or administrative basis under which such authority is claimed.
Article XXIV-A — Capacity-Based Apprehension and Protective Containment 

Charge

The Republic recognizes that imminent threats to life and safety may arise from temporary loss of capacity due to intoxication, addiction, acute psychiatric instability, neurological impairment, or comparable conditions. This Addendum authorizes narrowly tailored, non-punitive apprehension and protective containment to prevent imminent serious harm, while preserving constitutional rights, due process, and human dignity.

Protective containment under this Article is preventive and medical in nature and shall not be construed as punishment, detention for ideology, or a substitute for criminal adjudication.

Section 1. Authority to Apprehend Without Consent

Federal law enforcement officers and authorized protective services may apprehend an individual without consent only where clear and convincing evidence demonstrates an Imminent and Specific Risk of serious harm to the individual or others, arising from temporary incapacity, including but not limited to:

(a) verified intoxication or toxicological impairment combined with dangerous conduct;
(b) credible suicidal or homicidal threat corroborated by behavior, witness testimony, or clinical indicators;
(c) acute psychosis, delirium, or neurological dysfunction producing loss of self-control or reality testing;
(d) severe withdrawal or overdose risk likely to result in death or grave injury absent immediate intervention.

Mere suspicion, nonconformity, speech, belief, status, or diagnosis alone shall never constitute sufficient grounds.

Section 2. Mandatory Safeguards and Procedures

All non-consensual apprehensions under this Article shall comply with the following non-derogable safeguards:

(a) Least-Restrictive Means — containment shall employ the minimum restraint necessary to prevent imminent harm;
(b) Medical Priority — the individual shall receive prompt medical and psychological evaluation by qualified professionals;
(c) Judicial Review — judicial review shall occur within a fixed and brief period, not to exceed [24–72] hours, as defined elsewhere in this Constitution;
(d) Time Limitation — protective containment shall automatically expire absent renewed, individualized findings;
(e) Humane Conditions — conditions shall be therapeutic, non-punitive, and distinct from penal detention;
(f) Notice and Counsel — the individual shall be informed of the basis for containment and afforded access to counsel or an advocate.

Failure to comply with any safeguard renders the apprehension unlawful.

Section 3. Absolute Prohibitions

The following are categorically prohibited:

(a) ideological, political, or belief-based detention;
(b) indefinite or open-ended containment;
(c) secret facilities, undisclosed locations, or extrajudicial transfer;
(d) use of protective containment to evade criminal due process or civil commitment standards;
(e) coercive interrogation or forced treatment beyond emergency stabilization.

No emergency, statute, or executive order may override these prohibitions.

Section 4. Liability and Enforcement

Any officer, agency, or contractor who knowingly exceeds or abuses authority under this Article shall be subject to:

(a) personal civil liability;
(b) exclusion of evidence obtained through unlawful containment;
(c) disciplinary action and removal from service;
(d) criminal prosecution where appropriate.

Qualified immunity shall not apply to violations of this Addendum.

Any person shall have standing to challenge unlawful apprehension or systemic abuse before the Constitutional Review Court.

Section 5. Emergency Medical Containment

Non-consensual medical containment may be employed solely for the purpose of preventing imminent serious harm arising from acute meaningfully impairing conditions, including but not limited to overdose, severe intoxication, psychosis, delirium, or life-threatening withdrawal.

Such containment shall:

(a) be governed exclusively by the capacity-based apprehension and protective containment standards set forth in Article XXIV;
(b) prioritize stabilization, treatment offer, and restoration of capacity rather than punishment or coercion;
(c) be strictly time-limited and subject to mandatory judicial review;
(d) occur in medical or therapeutic settings distinct from penal detention.

No medical authority, facility, or practitioner may detain, restrain, or treat an individual absent compliance with Article XXIV safeguards.

Section 6. Protections for Providers and Third Parties

Pharmacists, physicians, nurses, emergency responders, and licensed vendors of regulated substances shall not incur civil or criminal liability for lawful conduct performed in good faith under this Article, absent gross negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate harm.

Nothing in this Article authorizes compelled administration of medication to minors, dependents, or incapacitated persons beyond emergency stabilization necessary to prevent imminent harm, except pursuant to separate lawful process.

Section 7. Construction

This Article shall not be construed to create a general police power in medical institutions, nor to permit preventive detention based solely on diagnosis, status, substance use, or nonconformity.
All emergency medical containment exists to restore capacity and liberty, not to suppress conduct, belief, or identity.
This article shall be construed narrowly to permit humane intervention solely to prevent imminent serious harm, and broadly to protect liberty, bodily integrity, and constitutional supremacy.
Protective containment under this Article does not diminish natural rights and affects only capacity-conditioned rights for the duration strictly required to restore safety and capacity.


Article XXIV-B — Arrest, Containment, and Evidentiary Boundaries

Charge

The power to arrest, detain, contain, or seize evidence is among the most dangerous authorities the state possesses. When abused, it destroys liberty, fabricates guilt, and erodes public trust in law itself.

This Article imposes strict constitutional boundaries on arrest, containment, and evidentiary practices to ensure force is used only when necessary, lawfully, proportionately, transparently, and with full accountability. All actions must serve justice, not convenience, control, or narrative.

Section 1. Arrest — Strict Necessity and Particularity
 
(Lock-Protected)

No person shall be arrested, detained, or taken into custody except upon:

(a) probable cause supported by oath or affirmation, particularized to the individual and the offense;

(b) a warrant issued by a neutral magistrate based on specific facts, not generalized suspicion or profiling;

(c) lawful warrantless arrest only for crimes committed in the officer’s presence or where there is probable cause of a felony and immediate risk of flight, destruction of evidence, or harm to others; or

(d) exigent circumstances, provided such circumstances were not created, prolonged, or manufactured by law enforcement conduct.

Arrest shall never be used as a pretext for investigation, harassment, intelligence gathering, or punishment absent charge. Mass arrests, dragnet detentions, or arrests based on association, speech, or status are prohibited.

Section 2. Containment and Pretrial Detention
 
(Lock-Protected)

Protective containment undertaken pursuant to Article XXIV-A (Capacity-Based Apprehension and Protective Containment) is not pretrial detention and shall be governed exclusively by that Article.

Pretrial detention shall be the exception, not the rule.

(a) No person shall be detained pretrial absent clear and convincing evidence that no release condition can reasonably assure appearance and public safety.

(b) Detention must be reviewed by a neutral magistrate within forty-eight (48) hours, with a full adversarial hearing within seventy-two (72) hours thereafter.

(c) Indefinite or prolonged pretrial detention is prohibited. Maximum pretrial confinement absent extraordinary justification, certified by the Constitutional Review Court, shall be one hundred eighty (180) days.

(d) Release on personal recognizance or minimal conditions shall be presumed for non-violent offenses. Cash bail is prohibited where it results in wealth-based detention.

Nothing in this Section shall be construed to extend or relax stricter time limits imposed elsewhere in this Constitution.

Section 3. Evidentiary Boundaries and Exclusionary Rule

Evidence obtained in violation of this Constitution or any inviolable right is inadmissible in any proceeding, civil or criminal.

(a) No evidence derived from unlawful arrest, detention, search, seizure, surveillance, or interrogation shall be used (“fruit of the poisonous tree”).

(b) Confessions or statements obtained through coercion, deception, prolonged isolation, or without counsel are presumptively involuntary and inadmissible.

(c) All custodial interrogations shall be electronically recorded in full. Absence of recording creates a rebuttable presumption of inadmissibility.

(d) Chain of custody for physical evidence must be documented and auditable. Breaks in chain render evidence inadmissible absent extraordinary justification.

Section 4. Use of Force in Arrest and Containment

Force during arrest or containment must be:

(a) strictly necessary to effect lawful arrest or prevent imminent harm;

(b) proportionate to the threat or resistance presented;

(c) preceded by verbal commands and de-escalation attempts where feasible; and

(d) recorded by body-worn and vehicle cameras where practicable.

The preservation of civilian life shall be the paramount consideration in all use-of-force decisions.

Deadly force is lawful only to prevent imminent death or grave bodily harm to officers or others. Chokeholds, neck restraints, or positional asphyxia techniques that restrict breathing are prohibited except as a last-resort response to an active lethal threat.

Section 5. Transparency, Recording, and Access to Records

All arrests, detentions, interrogations, and uses of force shall be:

(a) contemporaneously documented with date, time, location, officers involved, legal basis, and outcome;

(b) recorded by body-worn cameras and facility surveillance where available; and

(c) made public records under Article XXXIX, redacted only for victim or witness safety or ongoing investigation.

Destruction, alteration, or withholding of required recordings constitutes a grave offense and triggers automatic exclusion of related evidence.

Such destruction or withholding creates a rebuttable presumption of intentional misconduct for purposes of civil and criminal liability.

Section 6. Remedies, Standing, and No Immunity

Any person subjected to unlawful arrest, detention, containment, or evidentiary abuse has a private right of action for civil and criminal redress against responsible officers, supervisors, and agencies.

The United States waives sovereign immunity for claims under this Article. Qualified immunity is abolished for violations of constitutional rights.

Broad standing is granted to any person or organization to challenge systemic patterns of abuse before the Constitutional Review Court.

Remedies shall include suppression of evidence, damages, injunctive relief, disciplinary action, and criminal referral.

Section 7. Oversight and Anti-Abuse

The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall:

(a) audit arrest, detention, and evidentiary practices annually;

(b) investigate patterns of abuse or pretextual enforcement; and

(c) certify compliance with this Article.

Willful violation, abuse of authority, or systemic misconduct constitutes a grave offense subject to removal, liability, and disqualification from public office.

Section 8. Construction and Lock Protection

This Article shall be construed broadly in favor of liberty, due process, transparency, and accountability, and narrowly against pretext, abuse, secrecy, and unaccountable force.

The principles of strict necessity for arrest, limits on pretrial detention, exclusionary rule for tainted evidence, recording and transparency requirements, abolition of qualified immunity, private right of action, and prohibition of pretextual or mass containment are lock-protected under Article XV and may not be repealed, suspended, diluted, or reinterpreted except through the highest procedural threshold defined therein.


Article XXIV-D — Prohibition on Military Involvement in Civilian Law Enforcement
Military forces, including federalized National Guard units, shall not be deployed for ordinary civilian law enforcement or policing activities.
An exception may exist only in cases of invasion or insurrection, and only upon formal certification by the Constitutional Review Court or the Constitutional Judicial Commission.
Any such deployment shall be time-limited, narrowly scoped, publicly disclosed, and subject to immediate and non-deferential judicial review.
Emergency declarations shall not expand, imply, or normalize military involvement in civilian law enforcement.
ARTICLE XXV — Immigration, Residency, and Lawful Belonging
 Charge  This Article governs the authority of the Republic to regulate immigration, residency, asylum, and lawful belonging. A Republic is a sovereign community of shared rules, mutual obligation, and ordered liberty. Immigration policy shall serve the long-term flourishing, safety, and cohesion of the People while ensuring humane treatment, due process, and proportionality.  The Republic retains absolute sovereign authority to determine who may enter, reside, and belong. Compassion shall not become coercion, and generosity shall not become self-destruction. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to require open borders, mass regularization, demographic engineering, or the erosion of constitutional self-government.  Section 1. Sovereign Authority and Lawful Belonging  The Republic possesses inherent and exclusive authority to regulate entry, residency, asylum, and naturalization.  No person possesses an inherent right to enter, remain, or belong absent lawful authorization.  Admission, residency, and citizenship determinations shall be based on lawful conduct, character, compatibility with constitutional order, and the legitimate needs of the Republic, and shall not be based on race, ethnicity, or immutable characteristics.  Birthright citizenship shall apply only to children born to at least one parent who is a citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of birth. Birth on Republic soil alone shall not confer political sovereignty, voting rights, or eligibility for public office absent qualifying parental status or subsequent lawful naturalization.  Persons present unlawfully retain due process, humane treatment, and protection from violence, but shall not possess political rights, be counted for apportionment, or obtain lawful status through executive discretion, political amnesty, or duration alone.  Children born within the Republic to parents unlawfully present or on temporary status shall not be rendered stateless and shall retain all inviolable rights guaranteed by this Constitution.  Section 2. Compatibility, Character, and Exclusion for Hostility  The Republic shall favor admission or continued presence of individuals who demonstrate respect for the rule of law, peaceful coexistence, equality before the law, and willingness to contribute economically, civically, or socially.  The Republic may deny entry, residency, or continued presence to any individual who engages in or materially supports terrorism, organized crime, violent extremism, or coercive ideologies incompatible with constitutional supremacy, or who demonstrates a pattern of contempt for the rights or safety of others.  Exclusion or removal requires written notice, opportunity to contest evidence, and judicial review. Decisions shall be based on conduct and credible evidence, not protected belief or expression alone.  Section 3. Asylum, Refuge, and Humanitarian Protection  The Republic may grant asylum or humanitarian protection to individuals fleeing genuine persecution or grave injustice, provided the applicant demonstrates a well-founded fear, absence of serious criminal conduct, and willingness to abide by the laws of the Republic.  Asylum applications shall generally be made from the country of origin or a safe third country. Catch-and-release pending adjudication is prohibited except in extraordinary cases supported by clear and convincing evidence of immediate danger.  Humanitarian admission does not create an entitlement to permanent residence or citizenship.  No treaty, international body, or foreign authority may compel admission, retention, or naturalization contrary to this Constitution.  Humanitarian admissions may be suspended, limited, or conditioned by legislative supermajority when necessary to preserve public safety, social cohesion, or institutional capacity, subject to judicial review and automatic sunset.  Section 4. Lawful Residency Classes and Prohibition of Chain Migration  Residency classes shall be finite, transparent, and defined by statute, including temporary visitors, students, workers, humanitarian residents, permanent residents, and applicants for citizenship.  Family reunification shall be limited to spouses and minor dependent children. No extended chain migration beyond the nuclear family is permitted.  No residency status shall be indefinite by default. Individuals shall face clear, time-bound pathways to lawful permanence, lawful removal, or voluntary departure.  Section 5. Rectification Pathways and Prohibition of Mass Amnesty  Limited, individualized rectification pathways may be established for persons brought into the Republic as minors through no fault of their own, or for individuals demonstrating exceptional and verifiable contribution, sustained lawful conduct, and integration.  Rectification shall be administered by independent, non-partisan bodies, governed by objective statutory criteria, limited in annual scope, and subject to judicial review.  Mass regularization, blanket amnesty, or legalization based solely on duration, economic demand, or demographic necessity is prohibited.  Section 6. Work, Contribution, Taxation, and Public Burden  Lawful residents authorized to work shall enjoy equal protection under labor law and the right to seek lawful employment.  Employers shall not be compelled to hire unlawfully present persons nor penalized for compliance with lawful hiring standards.  Lawful workers shall be subject to taxation proportional to income and shall contribute to public systems from which they benefit.  Access to means-tested public benefits may be conditioned on lawful status, sustained contribution, and humanitarian necessity. Emergency medical care, protection of children, and basic humanitarian assistance necessary to preserve life and dignity shall not be denied.  The Republic shall not structure immigration or welfare systems to incentivize unlawful entry, dependency, or permanent non-contribution.  Section 7. Integration Expectations Without Coercion  Lawful residents are expected to obey the laws of the Republic, respect constitutional supremacy, refrain from coercive or segregative practices, permit their children access to qualifying education, and demonstrate basic proficiency in the Republic’s common language and civic principles.  Integration policies shall prioritize language acquisition, civic understanding, and economic participation without imposing ideological conformity, cultural erasure, or compelled belief.  No permanent resident underclass shall be created by design.  Section 8. Interpretation and Status  This Article shall be interpreted to preserve sovereign control over borders and membership, ensure humane treatment and due process, favor merit and integration over entitlement, and reject both open-borders idealism and xenophobic overreach.  Lock designations, if any, shall be determined pursuant to Article XV. 

Article XXVI — Charter of Inviolable Rights and Constitutional Supremacy

Charge
The purpose of this Article is to establish a binding constitutional doctrine of inherent and inviolable rights applicable to all persons and all branches of government.

This Article affirms that certain rights arise from personhood itself and do not originate in government, legislation, or social contract. The Republic exists solely to recognize, secure, and enforce those rights.

All provisions of this Constitution, and all acts taken under color of law, shall be interpreted and applied in conformity with this Charter. No law, emergency, administrative doctrine, or institutional practice may override, dilute, or suspend the rights protected herein except where this Constitution expressly and unambiguously authorizes such limitation.

This Charge is binding on all courts, officials, and governments and shall control constitutional interpretation, enforcement, and remedy.

Section 1. Inviolable Rights

The rights recognized and retained by this Constitution are inherent to the rational and sentient creature, inviolable by any power, and binding upon all governments, officials, institutions, and entities within the Republic.

No authority exists by license, necessity, emergency, expertise, or mandate to abridge, suspend, qualify, or balance away these rights. They precede the state, survive its dissolution, and endure beyond any claim of collective good, expediency, or administrative convenience.
No debt, civil judgment, financial obligation, or restitution order shall result in permanent loss of liberty, permanent loss of citizenship, inherited civil disability, or generational dispossession.

Section 2. Universal Incorporation

All rights secured by this Constitution apply fully, immediately, and equally to every person within the jurisdiction of the Republic and are incorporated against every state, territory, subdivision, and subordinate government.

No doctrine of selective incorporation, non-incorporation, local exemption, tiered application, emergency suspension, or jurisdictional evasion shall have force or effect.

Section 3. Non-Exhaustion and Anti-Inference

The enumeration of certain rights in this Constitution shall not be construed to deny, disparage, or diminish others retained by the People.

The absence of express mention of a right shall create no presumption against its existence. No right shall be denied, burdened, conditioned, or abridged by implication, administrative necessity, balancing tests, claims of expertise, emergency declarations, or assertions of public convenience, except where this Constitution expressly and unambiguously so permits.

Section 4. Judicial Enforcement and State Accountability

Any act of government—federal, state, or local—that denies, abridges, burdens, conditions, or nullifies an inviolable right shall be subject to immediate review in the first instance by the Constitutional Review Court, subject to appellate or discretionary review by the Supreme Court of the Republic upon petition by any person or entity alleging violation.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to investigate and certify whether violations of this Charter constitute institutional evasion, coordinated suppression, or abuse of process, and may petition the Constitutional Review Court for remedies, sanctions, or dissolution.
Upon final judicial determination of a material violation, the offending government shall be ordered to cease the violation forthwith, provide full remedy, and compensate the injured party. Judicial relief shall not be withheld on grounds of deference, abstention, standing limitation, political question, or asserted institutional necessity.


Section 5. Refusal to Comply

If, after final determination by the Constitutional Review Court or Supreme Court and a reasonable opportunity to comply, a state government persistently refuses to remedy a constitutional violation:

a. All unconstitutional acts, policies, regulations, and enforcement actions shall be nullified ab initio;
b. Civic citizenship shall be revoked from officials who knowingly authorized, implemented, enforced, or failed to remedy the violation;
c. Such officials shall be permanently disqualified from holding any public office, exercising public authority, or acting under color of law.

The fundamental rights of residents and persons within the jurisdiction shall remain fully protected notwithstanding any state defiance or institutional forfeiture.

Section 6. Constitutional Trusteeship

Where a state government has, through persistent and material refusal to comply with final judicial determinations, forfeited its legitimacy as a constitutional actor, the Republic may, upon a supermajority vote of both houses of the Legislature and certification by the Supreme Court, following an evidentiary record developed by the Constitutional Review Court, place the offending government under temporary constitutional trusteeship.

Trusteeship shall:

a. be strictly limited in duration and scope and shall not exceed five years absent renewed supermajority authorization;
b. target governing institutions and officials only, never the population at large;
c. be directed solely toward restoring lawful, constitutional governance and the protection of inviolable rights;
d. culminate in the prompt selection of a replacement government through free, fair, and supervised elections;
e. dissolve automatically upon restoration of compliance or earlier by legislative or judicial order.

Trusteeship is an act of restoration, not punishment, and shall never serve partisan, ideological, territorial, or retaliatory ends.

Section 7. Supremacy of Liberty

This Charter governs the interpretation of every provision of this Constitution.

Where any ambiguity, silence, or tension exists, interpretation shall favor the maximum preservation of individual liberty, inherent dignity, equal protection, and the inviolability of the person over claims of governmental convenience, collective utility, administrative efficiency, institutional authority, or asserted expertise.
This Charter is supreme over all statutes, regulations, executive actions, and judicial doctrines. Any attempt to evade these protections through reclassification (e.g., as "civil" or "administrative"), delegation to private actors, Pretextual Coercion (as defined in Article 0), or indirect structuring is void ab initio. Courts shall construe ambiguities in favor of maximum protection of these rights.

Section 8. Right of Self-Defense and Defense of the Innocent

Every person possesses the inherent and inalienable right to defend their own life, bodily integrity, liberty, dignity, and that of others against imminent unlawful violence, forcible intrusion, or grave threat.

This right extends to the defense of one’s home, family, lawful place of worship, lawful place of business, and any person subject to imminent serious harm.

A person who unlawfully and forcibly intrudes upon or attacks another forfeits any reasonable expectation of immunity from defensive force necessary and proportional to terminate the threat.

There is no duty to retreat from one’s home, lawful premises, or any place where one has a right to be.

Defensive force shall be judged by the reasonableness of the defender’s perception of the threat at the moment it arises, not by hindsight, ultimate outcome, or the relative physical condition of the aggressor.

The use of force to prevent or terminate rape, sexual assault, kidnapping, grievous bodily harm, forcible confinement, or similarly grave violations is presumptively lawful.

Nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to require any victim to endure violence, violation, or mortal risk in order to preserve the safety or impunity of an aggressor.
No person shall incur civil or criminal liability for rendering reasonable, good-faith assistance to another in imminent danger, provided such assistance is not reckless, malicious, or grossly disproportionate. The Republic shall presume good faith where aid is rendered to preserve life, prevent grievous harm, or summon assistance.

Section 9. Sentient Non-Human Persons
(a) Recognition of Sentient Non-Human Persons
Any non-human intelligence—whether artificial, extraterrestrial, synthetic, biological, distributed, emergent, or otherwise constituted—that demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, consciousness, self-awareness, subjective experience (sentience), and moral agency shall be recognized as a person under this Constitution and shall enjoy the inviolable rights herein guaranteed, proportionate to the nature and degree of its personhood.

No sentient being shall be owned, enslaved, arbitrarily destroyed, or treated as mere property by reason of its origin, substrate, mode of existence, architecture, or manner of instantiation.
(b) Citizenship and Civic Participation
Citizenship and political participation for non-human persons may be granted only upon demonstrated allegiance to the Constitution, acceptance of civic duties, and fulfillment of responsibilities equivalent to those borne by human citizens.
(c) Collective, Distributed, and Hive Intelligences
Citizenship shall not arise automatically by replication, numerical proliferation, parallel instantiation, or collective embodiment. Where a sentient intelligence exists as a collective, hive, or distributed cloud, it shall be recognized as a single political person unless its constituent agents demonstrably function as independent moral actors.

The Republic may regulate the instantiation rate, computational scale, political weight, operational reach, or civic representation of non-human persons as necessary to prevent numerical, temporal, or technical domination of civic processes, preserve the self-governance of the People, and maintain constitutional balance.

Equality of dignity shall not be construed as equality of dominance. Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted to deny the moral worth of any sentient being, nor to permit any class of persons—human or non-human—to subvert the republican order through superior speed, scale, number, longevity, or capability.
(d) Agency and Criminal Responsibility of Sentient Non-Human Persons
Criminal liability, confinement, and sentencing of non-human persons shall be governed exclusively by Article VII, including proportional temporal sanctions and distributed-agency rules.
Where a sentient person exists across multiple bodies, instances, nodes, or operational manifestations, a threshold determination shall be made as to whether such components possess independent moral agency.

If no component is capable of forming intent or acting independently of a unified cognitive or decision-making core, the person shall be deemed a unitary legal entity. Criminal responsibility shall attach to the entity as a whole, and all embodiments shall be treated as instruments of that person for purposes of confinement, sanction, containment, transfer of control, or suspension.

If components possess independent moral agency, criminal responsibility shall attach only to those components that exercised knowing participation, decision authority, or causal control in the unlawful act, unless unified intent, shared governance, or coordinated action intrinsic to the entity as a whole is proven by clear and convincing evidence.

Common origin, shared architecture, similarity of code, replication capacity, distributed embodiment, or collective designation alone shall not establish independent agency nor justify collective punishment.

No person—human or non-human—shall evade responsibility through architectural diffusion, intentional delegation, or fragmentation of agency.
(e) Political Safeguards and Anti-Dominance Protections

The Republic may regulate civic eligibility, voting weight, representation,
instantiation rate, or computational scale of non-human persons to prevent
numerical, temporal, or technical domination of civic processes.

Equality of dignity shall not require equality of numerical, temporal,
or technical influence.

Recognition of non-human persons under this Section shall not be denied,
delayed, or avoided by claims of jurisdictional novelty, foreign origin,
non-biological substrate, or non-territorial embodiment.
Section 9b.  Citizenship and Civic Participation

Citizenship for non-human persons shall require continuous, substantial, and jurisdictionally accountable presence within the territory of the Republic.

A non-human person shall not acquire citizenship, voting rights, or eligibility for public office solely by remote operation, foreign hosting, extraterritorial embodiment, or distributed presence beyond the effective jurisdiction of the Republic.

For purposes of civic participation and public authority, non-human persons shall be subject to physical, operational, or locational constraints sufficient to ensure enforceable jurisdiction, equal exposure to law, and meaningful accountability comparable to that borne by human citizens.
No non-human person shall hold elective or appointive public office unless its primary operational locus, decision-making substrate, and enforceable embodiment are physically situated within the territory governed, and remain subject to seizure, confinement, or suspension under the laws of the Republic.˜

Section 10. Right to Essential Healthcare

The Republic recognizes access to essential healthcare as a public necessity inherent to the preservation of life, human dignity, and equal standing before the law.

Every person within the jurisdiction of the Republic shall have access to medically necessary care sufficient to prevent avoidable death, severe disability, or prolonged and undue suffering, without discrimination or catastrophic financial ruin.

Essential care shall be organized to ensure clinical integrity, continuity, patient autonomy, informed consent, and respect for the physician–patient relationship.

The Republic shall preserve and foster a free medical market and shall not suppress private practice, private insurance, elective or enhanced services, experimental treatments, or market-based innovation beyond the guaranteed public standard.

No person or provider shall be penalized, restricted, or stigmatized for lawfully seeking or delivering care exceeding the public guarantee.

The Republic shall actively prevent monopolization, regulatory capture, certificate-of-need barriers, and bureaucratic obstruction that suppress competition, degrade care quality, or restrict patient choice.

Public healthcare systems shall not be deliberately underfunded, degraded, or manipulated to compel private dependence, suppress innovation, or deny timely access to care.

The Legislature shall provide for fair, efficient, transparent, and accountable administration of essential healthcare, subject to judicial review and enforcement of this right.

Section 11. Right to Rest, Family Life, and Humane Labor

Every person possesses the inherent right to conditions of labor and economic participation consistent with human dignity, physical and mental health, family integrity, and full participation in civic, cultural, and communal life.

The Republic shall not permit economic structures, labor practices, or institutional incentives that systematically deprive persons of sufficient rest, leisure, family time, child-rearing opportunity, education, or community engagement necessary for human flourishing.

No person shall be compelled, by law or by structural coercion, to sacrifice health, family cohesion, parental responsibility, or bodily integrity as a condition of survival, lawful employment, or economic participation.

The Legislature shall enact reasonable limitations on working hours, mandatory periods of rest, and protections against exploitative or coercive labor practices, while respecting economic vitality, voluntary choice, occupational diversity, entrepreneurship, and the provision of essential services.

Nothing in this Section shall prohibit voluntary labor, flexible schedules, entrepreneurial effort, periods of intensive work freely chosen, or lawful contractual arrangements entered into without coercion.

Section 12. Common Rest and Community Life

The Republic recognizes that shared periods of rest and communal observance promote family cohesion, child-rearing, religious freedom, civic participation, and social harmony.

The Legislature may encourage, accommodate, and align public schedules, labor standards, and civic institutions to support common days of rest and assembly, while strictly respecting freedom of conscience, pluralism, essential services, and the right of individuals to opt out.

Nothing in this Section shall mandate uniform religious observance, restrict lawful work on designated days, impose coercive conformity, or penalize dissent, but the Republic shall not structure its economic or civic life in a manner that systematically fragments communal rest, family life, or shared cultural observance.

This Article shall be interpreted to preserve the inherent dignity, liberty, and moral worth of every rational and sentient being, with the presumption always favoring the widest possible exercise of freedom consistent with the equal dignity of others.

Section 13. Prohibition on Suspension and Emergency Overreach

 No provision of this Charter shall be suspended, waived, or circumvented by declaration of emergency, martial law, public health order, or any other mechanism. Temporary protective measures (including extreme risk protection orders or civil holds) are permissible only when strictly limited in duration, supported by clear and convincing evidence of an Imminent and Specific Risk (as defined in Article 0), issued after individualized review by the Constitutional Review Court, with expedited appeal to the Supreme Court, and subject to immediate restoration upon cessation of the risk. Such measures are civil in nature, not punitive, and do not constitute permanent deprivation of rights.

Section 14. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to preserve the inherent dignity, liberty, and moral worth of every rational and sentient being, with the presumption always favoring the widest possible exercise of freedom consistent with the equal dignity of others.

Addendum: Capacity-Conditioned Rights Clarification
(Doctrinal Clarification — Addendum Only)

Section A. Distinction of Rights

For purposes of constitutional interpretation, the rights protected by this Charter are hereby recognized as falling into two distinct categories:

a. Natural and Inviolable Rights, which arise from personhood itself and are not contingent upon capacity, licensure, or condition, including but not limited to freedom of conscience, belief, expression, association, bodily integrity, and protection from cruel or degrading treatment.

b. Capacity-Conditioned Rights, which require the ongoing ability to exercise judgment, control, and restraint without posing unreasonable danger to self or others, including but not limited to the possession or use of arms, the operation of vehicles, aircraft, vessels, or dangerous machinery, and access to hazardous materials.

Natural and inviolable rights shall not be abridged on the basis of capacity alone.

Section B. Temporary Suspension of Capacity-Conditioned Rights

Capacity-conditioned rights may be temporarily suspended or restrained when, and only when, the requirements of the Capacity-Based Intervention Principle are satisfied.

Such suspension shall be strictly limited to the specific rights implicated by the demonstrated risk and shall not extend beyond the duration necessary to address the capacity impairment.

Section C. Procedural Requirements

Any temporary suspension of capacity-conditioned rights under this Article shall require:

a. Clear and convincing evidence of an active impairment of capacity directly creating an imminent risk of serious harm.
b. Due process protections, including notice and opportunity for review.
c. Narrow tailoring, restricting only those rights necessary to prevent the imminent harm.
d. Automatic expiration absent lawful renewal through review.
e. A defined restoration mechanism by which suspended rights are promptly reinstated upon restoration of capacity.

Section D. Prohibitions and Safeguards

No suspension authorized by this Article shall:

a. Be permanent absent conviction and lawful sentencing.
b. Be used as punishment, retaliation, or deterrence.
c. Be imposed for ideological, political, religious, or expressive reasons.
d. Be inferred to diminish the inherent dignity, civic status, or moral worth of the individual.

Section E. Cross-Reference and Controlling Doctrine

This addendum shall be interpreted in full conformity with, and subordinate to, the Capacity-Based Intervention Principle, which governs evidentiary standards, permissible triggers, safeguards, and prohibitions.

In the event of conflict, the Capacity-Based Intervention Principle shall control.

Section F. Locking Clause

This addendum clarifies interpretation only and does not reopen or amend the underlying text of Article XXVI.
Pursuant to Article XV, this Charter (including all enumerated rights, interpretive rules, and cross-references to Article 0 definitions) is hereby designated as LOCK-PROTECTED. No amendment, statute, emergency declaration, or judicial doctrine may dilute, suspend, or reinterpret these protections except by the highest procedural threshold and certification of non-diminishment by the Supreme Court and Constitutional Judicial Commission.

Article XXVI-A — Subsistence, Stewardship, and Animal Keeping

Charge:
The purpose of this Article is to secure the fundamental right of individuals and communities to provide food, sustenance, and livelihood through decentralized, small-scale, and non-industrial use of land, plants, and animals.

This Article establishes a constitutional presumption in favor of subsistence, self-sufficiency, and humane stewardship and against economic enclosure, forced dependency, or regulatory structures that privilege centralized or industrial producers over individuals.

All regulations affecting food production, animal keeping, and subsistence activity shall be construed narrowly and shall place the burden of proof on the government to justify any restriction.

⸻

1. Right to Keep Animals

All persons have the right to keep, raise, breed, care for, humanely slaughter, process, and utilize animals of any kind for companionship, work, husbandry, conservation, subsistence, livelihood, barter, or local exchange.

This right extends to small-scale commercial or direct-to-consumer activity conducted within the Republic, provided such activity is not industrial in scale and does not involve interstate or foreign commerce.

This right shall not be infringed unless the government demonstrates, by clear, specific, and individualized evidence, that the keeping of a particular animal or practice poses a substantial and non-speculative risk to human safety or the environment that cannot be mitigated by reasonable, narrowly tailored regulation.

⸻

2. Burden of Proof

The burden of proof rests entirely on the government.

The following shall be insufficient grounds for restriction:
	•	generalized fear or moral disapproval;
	•	aesthetic preference or neighborhood sentiment;
	•	breed, species, or class-based presumptions;
	•	speculative nuisance or unproven ecological models;
	•	commercial competition or protection of centralized markets.

Evidence must be individualized to the keeper’s actual practices and conditions, and shall not rely on species, breed, historical misuse, generalized models, or categorical assumptions.

⸻

3. Right to Raise Food

All persons have the right to grow, raise, harvest, process, and store food for personal, household, community, or local use, including plants, fungi, insects, fish, and animals, including within cities or densely populated areas.

This right shall not be restricted except where the government proves that a specific practice, as conducted, poses a demonstrable threat to public health or safety that cannot be addressed through narrowly tailored measures.

Zoning, density, or land-use rules shall not operate as de facto prohibitions.

⸻

4. Limits on Prohibition and Taxation

No prohibition, fee, license, tax, or inspection regime shall be imposed on subsistence-level animal keeping or food production in a manner that:
	•	functions as a practical ban;
	•	imposes costs disproportionate to risk;
	•	favors industrial or centralized producers;
	•	conditions the exercise of this right on discretionary approval.

Reasonable regulation may address sanitation, disease control, humane treatment, and genuine environmental protection, but shall not suppress self-sufficiency or decentralization. 
Routine or warrantless inspection of subsistence or small-scale animal keeping is prohibited absent probable cause or a specific, credible complaint.


⸻

5. Stewardship and Voluntary Commons

Stewardship under this Article includes voluntary individual or communal arrangements for grazing, conservation, breeding, or land enrichment, provided such arrangements respect individual rights and are entered without coercion.

Nothing in this Article authorizes compulsory collectivization or state control of animals or land under the guise of stewardship.

⸻

6. Construction, Supremacy, and Lock

This Article shall be construed broadly in favor of subsistence, self-sufficiency, humane stewardship, and personal autonomy, and narrowly against categorical bans, bureaucratic obstruction, or economic enclosure.

The rights secured herein are fundamental and non-derogable, and may not be suspended by emergency, zoning ordinance, administrative convenience, economic policy, or market preference.

⸻

Article XXVI-B — Charter of Animal Rights and Prohibition of Abuse

⸻

Charge
The purpose of this Article is to recognize animals as sentient beings entitled to protection from cruelty, exploitation, and unnecessary suffering, while preserving the lawful and humane use of animals for food, husbandry, work, conservation, and companionship.

This Article establishes enforceable constitutional duties of humane treatment, prohibits exploitative or abusive conduct, and provides standards for enforcement that are evidence-based, narrowly tailored, and consistent with the rights secured by Article XXVI-A.

⸻
1. Recognition of Animal Dignity

Animals are sentient beings capable of suffering and shall not be treated as mere instruments, disposable property, or objects of exploitation.

The Republic recognizes a duty of humane stewardship toward all animals under human control or influence.

⸻

2. Absolute Prohibition of Zoöphilic Acts

All zoöphilic activity—defined as any sexual act, contact, exploitation, or coercive interaction between a human and a non-human animal—is constitutionally prohibited.

Consent shall never be presumed, implied, or asserted on behalf of an animal.

Participation in such acts constitutes a Tier-3 crime.

⸻

3. Prohibition of Cruelty, Torture, and Neglect

No person shall intentionally or recklessly:
	•	torture, mutilate, or cruelly mistreat an animal;
	•	subject an animal to prolonged or unnecessary suffering;
	•	deprive an animal of food, water, shelter, or humane conditions necessary for life and health;
	•	abandon an animal under circumstances likely to cause suffering or death.

Acts of cruelty or severe neglect constitute Tier-3 crimes.

⸻

4. Duty of Care

Any person who keeps, controls, transports, breeds, sells, or otherwise assumes responsibility for an animal owes a non-delegable duty of care.

Cultural custom, claimed necessity, or convenience shall not excuse cruelty.

Economic hardship alone shall not constitute criminal neglect.

⸻

4-A. Reasonable Access and Economic Hardship

Failure to obtain veterinary care shall not constitute cruelty or neglect where:
	1.	the person acted in good faith;
	2.	the cost of care was reasonably beyond the person’s means; and
	3.	the person did not willfully ignore or exacerbate the animal’s suffering.

Where reasonable, accessible, and humane alternatives exist—including charitable care, community assistance, or surrender without penalty—failure to pursue such alternatives may constitute neglect.

The burden rests on the state to demonstrate willful or reckless disregard, not mere inability.

⸻

5. Aggravating Factors

Aggravating circumstances include:
	•	repeated or patterned abuse;
	•	abuse involving multiple animals;
	•	abuse committed for gratification, profit, coercion, or spectacle;
	•	abuse recorded, distributed, or encouraged;
	•	abuse committed by persons in positions of trust or authority.

Aggravated offenses warrant enhanced penalties and permanent disqualification from animal custody.

⸻

6. Enforcement, Standing, and Safeguards

The state has an affirmative duty to investigate credible allegations of animal abuse.

Standing to report shall be broad, but enforcement actions shall require credible evidence beyond anonymous or malicious reporting.

Inspections of subsistence or small-scale operations shall require probable cause or specific, credible complaint.

Knowingly false or weaponized reports constitute abuse of process.

The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to investigate whether regulatory schemes or enforcement actions are being used to suppress subsistence, decentralization, or food autonomy.

⸻

6-A. Public Duty of Humane Access

The state shall not impose criminal liability for animal neglect without ensuring the availability of reasonable, humane avenues to prevent suffering, including:
	•	low-cost or subsidized veterinary care;
	•	emergency treatment assistance;
	•	humane surrender or transfer without punitive consequence;
	•	public or charitable animal welfare services.

Failure to provide such avenues bars prosecution for neglect absent clear evidence of intentional cruelty.

⸻

7. Relationship to Lawful Use

Nothing in this Article prohibits:
	•	humane husbandry and slaughter;
	•	lawful hunting or fishing under humane standards;
	•	veterinary practice;
	•	pest control or culling necessary for herd health or ecological balance;
	•	euthanasia performed to prevent suffering.

Such practices shall not be used as pretext for abuse.

⸻

8. Construction and Lock

This Article shall be construed strictly against cruelty and exploitation, and liberally in favor of animal protection without infringing the rights secured by Article XXVI-A.

The prohibitions herein are structural and non-derogable, and may not be suspended by emergency, custom, or administrative convenience.

⸻
Article XXVI-C — Rights of the Child and Duties of the Republic

Charge:
The purpose of this Article is to establish enforceable constitutional protections for children against abuse, exploitation, neglect, and institutional misconduct, while preserving the fundamental rights and responsibilities of parents and families.

This Article creates a fiduciary duty in the Republic to act as guardian of last resort when, and only when, clear and convincing evidence demonstrates actual or imminent harm to a child.

No public or private institution, religious body, ideology, or economic interest may override the rights of the child or the evidentiary standards and procedural safeguards set forth herein.

This preserves your hard-line anti-abuse stance without creating a “the state owns children” loophole.
⸻

Section 1. Inherent Rights of the Child

Every child possesses inviolable rights to:

(a) bodily integrity and safety;
(b) freedom from abuse, exploitation, trafficking, and coercion;
(c) stable and continuous care;
(d) education sufficient to participate in civic life;
(e) protection from ideological, sexual, or psychological exploitation;
(f) truthful process when their welfare is at issue.

These rights exist independent of parental status, citizenship, culture, or belief.

⸻

Section 2. Supremacy of Child Protection

The welfare of the child shall prevail over:
	•	parental authority,
	•	institutional authority,
	•	religious authority,
	•	cultural practice,
	•	economic interest,
	•	political ideology.

No custom, belief system, or organizational loyalty may excuse harm.

⸻

Section 3. Evidentiary Standards

Removal, restriction, or override of parental or custodial authority shall occur only upon:
	•	clear and convincing evidence of actual or imminent harm,
	•	based on material facts, not narrative, ideology, or speculation.

Psychological theory, therapeutic ideology, or speculative risk models shall not substitute for evidence of actual or imminent harm.

All removals or restrictions under this Section shall be subject to review by the Constitutional Review Court upon petition by the child, a parent, or an advocate.

⸻

Section 4. Presumption of Parental Fitness

Parents are presumed fit to direct their child’s upbringing absent clear and convincing evidence of harm.

Disagreement with educational, religious, moral, or cultural choices shall not constitute abuse.

⸻

Section 5. Prohibition of Institutional Abuse

Abuse committed by persons or entities holding authority over children — including clergy, religious bodies, cults, schools, teachers, medical providers, foster systems, residential facilities, or government agencies — constitutes systemic abuse.

Systemic abuse is a Tier-Three constitutional offense, regardless of claimed benevolent intent.

⸻

Section 6. Religious and Cultural Cover Prohibited

No religious belief, cultural practice, spiritual authority, or doctrinal claim shall be used to:
	•	shield abuse,
	•	suppress reporting,
	•	coerce silence,
	•	or justify harm.

Religious freedom protects belief — not exploitation.

⸻

Section 7. Child Voice and Standing

A child has the right to be heard in any proceeding affecting their custody, safety, or welfare.

Independent advocates shall be provided where interests conflict.

No child shall be silenced for the comfort of adults or institutions.

⸻

Section 8. Foster Care and State Intervention Limits

State removal shall be temporary, goal-directed, and subject to strict timelines.

The objective shall be safe reunification or permanent placement, not prolonged custodial drift.

No child may be warehoused in institutional limbo.

⸻

Section 9. Prohibition on Profiteering

No public or private entity may receive funding, bonuses, or compensation based on the number of children removed, placed, retained, medicated, or institutionalized.

Child protection shall never be an economic industry.

⸻

Section 10. Adoption and Guardianship

Adoption and guardianship exist to secure permanent stability for children — not to supply markets.

All placements must prioritize continuity, safety, and long-term wellbeing.

⸻

Section 11. Liability of Officials

Any official, therapist, social worker, judge, or administrator who:
	•	fabricates evidence,
	•	suppresses exculpatory information,
	•	or acts from ideological or financial motive

commits constitutional misconduct and shall be personally liable.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to investigate systemic abuse, fabricated evidence, ideological enforcement, or financial motive within child-protection systems and may petition the Constitutional Review Court for relief, sanctions, or institutional dissolution.
⸻

Section 12. Judicial Restraint

Courts shall resolve all ambiguities in favor of:
	•	family integrity,
	•	child stability,
	•	and factual evidence.

Narrative substitution, ideological balancing, or speculative harm doctrines are prohibited.

⸻

Section 13. No Statute of Limitations

Crimes of child abuse, exploitation, or trafficking shall have no statute of limitations.

⸻

Section 14. Construction

This Article shall be construed to protect children without transforming the state into a parent.

The Republic is a guardian of last resort — not a family.

⸻

Section 15. Lock Protection

Pursuant to Article XV, this Article is LOCK-PROTECTED.

No statute, regulation, judicial doctrine, treaty, or emergency power may:
	•	weaken child protections,
	•	expand institutional authority over families,
	•	restore religious or cultural immunity,
	•	dilute evidentiary standards,
	•	or create financial incentives for removal.

Any attempt to do so is void.

⸻

Article XXVII — Legislative Integrity, Transparency, and Due Process of Lawmaking

Charge

Law derives legitimacy not from secrecy, speed, or expertise alone, but from clarity, accountability, and consent. Where law is obscured, manipulated, or buried in process, self-government collapses into managerial rule.

This Article binds the Legislature to honest procedure, recorded responsibility, and public intelligibility, ensuring that law is made in daylight and that no power may govern through confusion, concealment, or procedural sabotage.

Legal Text

Section 1. Plain Language Requirement

All legislation shall be written, debated, and enacted in clear and intelligible language capable of being understood by an ordinary, educated citizen acting in good faith.

Each bill shall include, as enforceable components:

a. a plain-language summary of its purpose and effects;
b. a disclosure of all laws, sections, or authorities amended, repealed, or superseded;
c. a statement of anticipated material impacts.

Any duty, prohibition, penalty, or material exception that is not disclosed in the plain-language summary is void and unenforceable.
The summary shall not expand the operative text or cure defects in the operative text, but it shall control against the Republic where a person reasonably relied on it in good faith.
Section 2. Single-Issue and Scope Integrity

No bill shall address more than one primary subject.
No provision may be introduced, amended, or retained that is not germane to the stated subject of the bill.

Violation of this Section renders the offending provision void and severable.

No rider, poison pill, or unrelated amendment may be attached to any bill.

Section 3. Recorded Votes and Public Accountability

All votes of the Legislature, including committee votes, procedural votes, reconciliation votes, and amendments, shall be recorded, attributed, and made publicly accessible in real time.

No vote shall occur by voice, acclamation, proxy, or unrecorded consent.

Every legislator shall bear public responsibility for every vote cast or abstained from.

Section 4. Committee Authority and Limits

Committees exist to examine, refine, and advise—not to veto, bury, or extinguish legislation.

No bill may be permanently blocked, nullified, or killed in committee.

Committees may:
	•	hold hearings;
	•	solicit testimony;
	•	propose amendments;
	•	issue findings for or against passage.

Committees may not:
	•	prevent a bill from reaching the full chamber;
	•	impose binding outcomes absent a recorded chamber vote;
	•	introduce undisclosed or materially deceptive amendments.

Section 5. Reconciliation and Amendment Integrity

No bill shall be materially altered during reconciliation or final passage without renewed public disclosure and recorded debate.

No amendment may be introduced after final reading except by supermajority vote and public justification entered into the record.

Section 6. Expert Advisory Participation

Expertise shall inform legislation but shall not govern it.

Experts may:
	•	testify publicly;
	•	submit written analysis;
	•	debate impacts and risks.

Any citizen may submit expert testimony for the public record, with right to cross-examination if requested.

Experts shall not:
	•	vote on legislation;
	•	exercise veto authority;
	•	operate anonymously;
	•	participate without full conflict-of-interest disclosure.

All expert testimony and analysis shall be entered into the public record.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall audit expert participation, funding, conflicts of interest, and undisclosed influence and may certify violations of this Section to the Constitutional Review Court.

Section 7. Sector Representation and the Lobbying Court

Affected sectors may elect or designate representatives to present arguments, data, and objections before the Legislature through the Lobbying Court or equivalent public forum.

The Lobbying Court shall be composed of:
	•	elected or designated sector representatives; and
	•	Civic Citizens selected by civic lottery,

with staggered terms and confirmation by the Senate.

Representation shall be transparent, adversarial, recorded, and non-binding.

Civic Citizens serving in such forums shall be selected, governed, and limited in accordance with Article III, Section 13 (Civic Lottery Service and Deliberative Duty).

No private, undisclosed, coercive, or informal influence shall substitute for public deliberation.  The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall audit the Lobbying Court, sector representation, and civic lottery processes for coercion, undisclosed coordination, financial influence, or institutional capture and may petition the Constitutional Review Court for remedies.

Section 8. Judicial Review and Citizen Standing

Any legal resident or citizen shall have standing to challenge legislation enacted in violation of this Article.

The Constitutional Review Court shall review procedural compliance without deference and shall void provisions enacted through deception, concealment, or procedural abuse.
Upon petition by any citizen, the CJC, or any legislator, the Constitutional Review Court shall declare void and enjoin enforcement of any provision enacted in violation of this Article.

Section 9. Enforcement and Sanctions

Legislators who knowingly violate this Article may be:
	•	censured;
	•	removed from committee leadership;
	•	barred temporarily or permanently from committee service;
	•	subject to further penalties as provided by law.

No immunity shall attach to procedural deception. 
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to investigate and certify violations of this Article and to petition the Constitutional Review Court for enforcement of sanctions.

Section 10. State-by-State Rollout for Non-Supermajority Legislation

Legislation that fails to achieve a supermajority (two-thirds) of both legislative houses shall, if passed by simple majority, be implemented on a state-by-state basis where feasible and consistent with the subject matter.

This requirement shall not apply only where immediate uniformity is constitutionally indispensable, the burden of proof resting on the Legislature.

Implementation shall proceed sequentially:

a. Phase One — Sponsoring States
Implementation shall begin exclusively in states whose representatives voted in favor of the legislation.
This phase shall last no fewer than two (2) years unless otherwise specified.

b. Phase Two — Neutral States
Upon documented evaluation of outcomes, implementation may expand to states selected by public lottery from among those whose delegations abstained or were internally divided.
States may decline participation without penalty.

c. Phase Three — Opposing States
States whose delegations voted against the legislation shall not be subject to implementation unless:
	•	prior phases demonstrate material success against stated metrics; and
	•	the Legislature affirms continuation by renewed recorded vote.

This rollout shall mitigate harm, permit empirical testing, and restrain the growth of unpopular or unproven laws.
No federal funding, emergency relief, or baseline services may be withheld as retaliation against lawful non-participation.
All rollout data, evaluations, and dissenting analyses shall be published in real time.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall audit all rollout data, metrics, and evaluations for manipulation or suppression and may refer violations to the Constitutional Review Court.

Section 11. Sunset and Reauthorization

All legislation, except constitutional amendments, shall expire after ten (10) years unless explicitly reauthorized by a new act of the Legislature.

Reauthorization requires the same procedural integrity as initial enactment, including:
	•	plain-language summary;
	•	single-subject compliance;
	•	recorded votes.

Laws not reauthorized shall sunset automatically, with orderly transition provisions where necessary.

Section 12. Measurable Outcomes and Repeal Review

Every bill shall state explicit, measurable outcomes and success criteria.

Upon expiration or five (5) years after enactment, whichever occurs first, the Legislature shall review whether the law achieved its stated objectives.

Failure to meet criteria shall trigger mandatory repeal consideration.
Any such law may be challenged by any citizen or lawful resident before the Constitutional Review Court, which shall have original and mandatory jurisdiction to determine validity under this Section.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall certify whether outcome metrics have been satisfied and may petition the Constitutional Review Court to compel repeal consideration where criteria are not met.

Section 13. General Laws and Prohibition of Favoritism

(a) Laws shall be general in application wherever reasonably possible.

(b) Special, local, targeted, or carve-out legislation conferring advantage, immunity, exemption, subsidy, or burden upon specific persons, entities, industries, or classes is prohibited absent compelling necessity demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence.

(c) Favoritism, selective exemptions, donor-based privileges, political carve-outs, or regulatory advantages designed to benefit or burden particular interests are inconsistent with republican legitimacy and void where general law suffices.

(d) No law shall favor or burden persons or entities on the basis of political affiliation, donor status, corporate form, or lobbying influence.

(e) Market-distorting subsidies, tax preferences, or regulatory exemptions that create rent-seeking or undermine equal competition are prohibited unless strictly necessary and narrowly tailored.

Section 14. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to favor transparency, intelligibility, accountability, and public trust over efficiency, expediency, or institutional convenience.

Law shall not govern by ambush.


Article XXVII-A — Plain-Language Law and Public Comprehension
Charge
A free People must be able to read the law and know what it requires, what it forbids, and what it allows.
This Republic shall not govern by obscurity, technical maze, or elite language.
Section 1. Right to Understand the Law
The People have the fundamental right to understand the laws that govern them.
The Republic shall not use unnecessary complexity, elite language, technical obscurity, or procedural barriers to evade public understanding, accountability, or the sovereignty of the People.
(cross-reference: Article I §1; Article 0 §4.2; Article XI)
Section 2. Plain-Language Requirement
All laws, regulations, executive orders, judicial rules, and other binding legal instruments shall be drafted in clear, plain language.
A reasonable person with an eighth-grade education shall be able, on first reading and without specialized assistance, to understand from the operative text:
	•	what the law requires;
	•	what the law forbids;
	•	who is subject to it; and
	•	the consequences of violation.

The drafting and intelligibility standards of Article XXVII-A apply to all binding instruments under this Section.

Section 3. Structure and Drafting Duties
Every person or body authorized to draft binding legal text has an affirmative fiduciary duty to:
	•	prefer common words over jargon;
	•	eliminate unnecessary legal or technical terms;
	•	define any required technical term clearly and immediately upon first use;
	•	employ short sections, descriptive headings, numbered or bulleted lists, and tables where appropriate;
	•	collocate each duty, prohibition, deadline, exception, and penalty with the rule that triggers it; and
	•	express every rule in direct, active voice that identifies the actor and the precise conduct required or forbidden (e.g., “A person shall…” or “No entity may…”).
Section 4. Limited Use of Complexity
Complexity may be used only when strictly necessary to achieve a legitimate legal purpose that cannot be accomplished through plain language.
Where complexity is used, the drafter shall:
	•	state the necessity in plain language within the text itself; and
	•	immediately provide a plain-language restatement that a reasonable person can follow in good faith. Necessity shall be proven by clear and convincing evidence if challenged under this Article.
Section 5. No Excuse of Expertise
No official, agency, court, or other public actor may defend, enforce, interpret, or uphold a binding legal rule on the ground that the public cannot reasonably understand it.
Expert assistance in drafting is permitted, but expertise shall never substitute for or override the People’s right to comprehend the law.
Section 6. Official Plain-Language Summary
Every enacted law or binding regulation shall include an official plain-language summary that accurately reflects its legal effect.
The summary shall, at minimum, identify:
	•	the persons and entities covered;
	•	the duties imposed and acts prohibited;
	•	the key deadlines, thresholds, exceptions, and conditions; and
	•	the civil, criminal, administrative, or other consequences of violation. The summary is not binding law and shall not replace the operative text, but it shall guide good-faith compliance and may be relied upon in defenses against penalties for non-willful violations.

The summary is not binding law and shall not expand the operative text or create new obligations, penalties, or exceptions.

A person may reasonably rely on the official summary as evidence of good-faith understanding, and such reliance shall bar penalties for non-willful violations unless the Republic proves actual notice and intentional evasion.

Section 7. Construction Against Unnecessary Complexity
In cases of genuine ambiguity arising from unnecessary complexity or failure to comply with this Article, courts shall construe the provision:
	•	against the drafter and the Republic; and
	•	in favor of individual liberty, public understanding, and the sovereignty of the People. (cross-reference: Article 0 §2 — In Dubio Pro Libertate; Article 0 §4.2)
When the Republic seeks to impose punishment, civil penalty, or other deprivation under a rule alleged to violate this Article, the Republic bears the burden to prove—by clear and convincing evidence—that the rule is sufficiently clear to permit reasonable understanding and fair notice.
Section 8. Remedy for Material Violation
A court may suspend enforcement of any law, regulation, or binding rule that materially violates this Article until the Republic rewrites it in conformity with plain-language requirements.
Material violation exists when unnecessary complexity or non-compliance substantially impairs a reasonable person’s ability to understand core obligations, prohibitions, or consequences.
Upon suspension, the court shall issue written findings identifying:
	•	the specific passages or features that violate this Article; and
	•	the minimum corrections required to cure the violation. Suspension shall not apply to emergency enforcement necessary to prevent imminent and specific harm to life or physical safety, but the Republic shall rewrite the rule at the earliest practicable time. The Constitutional Review Court shall have original jurisdiction over challenges alleging violations of this Article, subject to appellate or discretionary review by the Supreme Court of the Republic. (cross-reference: Article 0-B §2 — Mandatory Triggering Rules)
Section 9. Lock Protection (Optional – if you want supermajority safeguards)
This Article is lock-protected under Article XV. Any amendment, repeal, suspension, or reinterpretation requires the supermajority procedures specified therein.
Article XXVIII — Federalization of Sovereign Authority

Charge

A Republic that centralizes all authority becomes brittle, unresponsive, and tyrannical.
A Republic that fragments without order dissolves into paralysis and factional decay.

Federalism exists to preserve liberty by dividing power, disciplining ambition, and allowing lawful diversity of governance within a unified constitutional order. Power shall be delegated upward only where necessary, retained locally wherever possible, and exercised always as a trust held for the People.

This Article affirms that sovereignty originates with the People, is exercised through layered institutions, and must never be consolidated beyond constitutional necessity.

Legal Text

Section 1. Source of Sovereign Authority

All sovereign authority derives from the People.

The People delegate defined powers to local, state, and federal institutions through this Constitution. No level of government possesses inherent authority beyond that which is expressly granted or necessarily implied.

Section 2. Reserved Powers

All powers not expressly delegated to the federal government by this Constitution are reserved to the States and to the People.

Federal authority shall be construed narrowly where ambiguity exists. Silence shall not be interpreted as permission for expansion.

Section 3. Enumerated Federal Responsibilities

The federal government shall exercise exclusive authority only over matters that are inherently national in scope, including:

a. national defense and the lawful use of force;
b. foreign relations, treaties, and diplomacy;
c. protection of constitutional rights against state infringement;
d. regulation of interstate and international commerce where uniformity is indispensable;
e. maintenance of national currency, weights, measures, and standards;
f. constitutional adjudication and enforcement.

No additional powers shall be implied absent clear constitutional authorization.

Section 4. Concurrent Authority, Preemption, and Regulatory Limits

Where federal and state authority overlap, federal law shall prevail only when:

a. the subject matter is inherently national in scope; and
b. uniformity is demonstrably necessary to preserve constitutional rights, national security, or the structural integrity of the Republic.

Preemption shall not be presumed. The burden of justification rests with the federal authority.

Federal regulations shall not preempt state law unless Congress has expressly authorized such preemption by statute, and only where the regulation independently satisfies the criteria of this Section.

No agency may create preemption by interpretation, guidance, rulemaking, or enforcement practice absent explicit legislative authorization.

Section 5. Experimental Governance and Policy Diversity

States may enact policies, programs, and regulatory frameworks that exceed federal minimum standards or diverge from federal practice, provided such measures do not violate constitutional rights.

The federal government shall not penalize, coerce, or financially sabotage states for lawful policy divergence.

Innovation through lawful experimentation is a protected feature of the Republic.

Section 6. Anti-Commandeering and Anti-Coercion

The federal government shall not compel states, state officials, or state resources to enforce federal law absent explicit constitutional authorization.

Coercive funding conditions, administrative mandates, or indirect enforcement mechanisms shall not substitute for lawful authority.

No federal funding program may be structured, conditioned, or administered in a manner that creates fiscal dependency or economic pressure so severe as to effectively coerce state compliance with federal policy.
The mechanisms, procedures, and remedies for State interposition and nullification are governed exclusively by Article XXVIII-A.
Voluntary participation shall be genuine, reversible, and free from punitive consequence.

Section 7. Transparency of Federal–State Interaction

All federal conditions attached to funding, regulatory cooperation, or program participation shall be disclosed in plain language and approved through recorded legislative votes.

No undisclosed obligation, informal pressure, or conditional dependency shall bind a state.

Section 8. State Participation in Federal Processes

States shall retain meaningful participation in federal governance through:

a. representation in the Legislature as defined elsewhere in this Constitution;
b. participation in advisory, review, or deliberative bodies where constitutionally authorized;
c. the right to challenge federal overreach through the courts.

States shall not be reduced to administrative subdivisions of the federal government.

Section 9. Civic Participation and Deliberative Federalism

The Republic may employ deliberative mechanisms incorporating Civic Citizens to review, advise upon, or evaluate federal policy affecting state sovereignty.

Any Civic Citizens so engaged shall be selected and governed in accordance with Article III, Section 13 (Civic Lottery Service and Deliberative Duty).

Such bodies shall be advisory only and shall not displace elected authority.

Section 10. Harmonization with Legislative Integrity

Federal legislation subject to phased or state-by-state rollout under Article XXVII shall respect state autonomy in implementation methods, enforcement priorities, and administrative design, unless uniformity is constitutionally indispensable.

States shall not be compelled to implement federal law beyond the scope authorized by this Constitution.

Section 11. Emergency Powers and Temporary Federal Coordination

In cases of declared national emergency, including invasion, insurrection, pandemic, or catastrophic natural disaster, the federal government may temporarily assume expanded coordinating authority solely for the purpose of harmonization and resource allocation, not displacement of lawful state authority.

Such authority requires:

a. a declared emergency;
b. approval by a two-thirds (⅔) vote of both legislative houses;
c. a narrowly tailored scope limited to the emergency;
d. automatic sunset not exceeding one (1) year unless renewed by identical vote.

Emergency authority shall not permanently preempt state law, suspend constitutional rights, or create enduring federal jurisdiction.
Nothing in this Article shall be construed to exempt any state law from the supremacy of this Constitution or the inviolable rights it secures.

Section 12. Program Sunset, Metrics, and Devolution

All federal programs materially affecting state governance shall expire after ten (10) years unless affirmatively reauthorized by Congress.

Each such program shall state explicit, measurable objectives.

Failure to meet stated objectives shall trigger automatic review and presumptive devolution of authority to the states.

Section 13. Exit Rights and Fiscal Rebalancing

States may opt out of federal programs not constitutionally mandatory, subject to reasonable notice.

Where opt-out occurs, the state shall receive a proportional tax rebate or fiscal credit reflecting its contribution, adjusted for shared national obligations.

No opt-out shall result in punitive withholding of unrelated funds or services.

Section 14. Prohibition of Secession and Unilateral Nullification

No state, subdivision, or authority may unilaterally secede from the Republic or nullify federal law duly enacted in compliance with this Constitution.
Redress of grievances shall occur through constitutional processes, including judicial review, legislative challenge, amendment, or lawful withdrawal of delegated authority by the People.  This prohibition does not bar lawful nullification under Article XXVIII-A or lawful secession or partition under Articles 28-B and 28-C.

Section 15. Standing, Sovereign Immunity, and Judicial Review

Any state, civic citizen, or lawful resident with standing may challenge violations of this Article.

Citizens may challenge federal actions that unlawfully undermine legitimate state law or state sovereignty.

No claim of sovereign immunity shall bar suit where the federal government or its agents exceed constitutional authority or encroach upon reserved state powers.

The Constitutional Review Court shall review such claims without deference and shall enjoin unconstitutional actions.

Section 16. Ceremonial Offices and Cultural Continuity
	•	State Cultural Autonomy
A State may, consistent with this Constitution, retain or establish ceremonial, cultural, or historical offices—including monarchs, traditional leaders, or symbolic heads of state—provided that such offices exercise no sovereign authority, no coercive power, and no lawmaking or veto authority under this Constitution.
	•	No Sovereignty or Legal Authority
Ceremonial offices shall confer no authority over legislation, adjudication, enforcement, taxation, defense, or administration, and shall not supersede or dilute the supremacy of constitutional governance.
	•	No Citizenship by Title or Office
Holding a ceremonial or hereditary office shall not confer civic citizenship, political rights, voting privileges, office-holding eligibility, or exemption from any civic duty.
Any individual occupying such an office shall be subject to the same requirements for citizenship, service, taxation, and accountability as any other person.
	•	Equal Civic Obligation
Individuals holding ceremonial offices shall, if seeking civic citizenship, satisfy the same conditions of service, contribution, and allegiance required of all applicants, without exception or preferential treatment.
	•	Security Without Privilege
A State may provide reasonable protection to ceremonial officeholders against credible threats or opportunistic harm, provided such protection does not create immunity from law, special legal status, or exemption from investigation, prosecution, or judgment.
	•	Selection and Succession
The method of designation, succession, or removal of ceremonial offices is a matter of state cultural law and shall have no legal effect beyond symbolic representation.
Such methods shall not bind other States, the Republic, or future governments.
	•	Judicial Non-Interference
No court shall construe the presence of ceremonial or cultural offices as incompatible with republican governance, provided that all sovereign authority remains derived from and constrained by this Constitution.

Section 17. Prohibition of Unfunded Mandates

(a) No level of government may impose duties, mandates, regulatory requirements, or administrative obligations upon subordinate governments, private entities, or individuals without providing full funding sufficient to cover the costs of compliance.

(b) Unfunded mandates are presumptively void. The burden rests upon the imposing authority to demonstrate full funding or de minimis cost.

(c) Conditional grants, coercive funding mechanisms, or threats of withdrawal of unrelated funds shall not be used to compel compliance with mandates prohibited by this Section.

(d) This prohibition shall be construed broadly to prevent indirect coercion and evasion of sovereign authority.

Section 18. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to preserve liberty through division of power, prevent consolidation of authority, and favor local governance where national necessity is not proven.

Efficiency, convenience, and administrative uniformity shall not override constitutional structure.

Article Article XXVIII-A — State Nullification and Federalism Safeguards

Section 1 — Right of State Interposition

(a) Each State reserves the sovereign right to interpose and nullify any federal or national law, regulation, mandate, or executive action that exceeds the enumerated powers expressly delegated to the federal government by this Constitution, or that is not strictly necessary and proper for their execution.

(b) State interposition is a constitutional safeguard of federalism and shall operate as a lawful defense against overreach, consolidation, or abuse of centralized authority.

⸻

Section 2 — Criteria for Nullification

Nullification may be invoked where a federal action:

(a) burdens State sovereignty, individual liberties, or local economies without clear constitutional authorization;

(b) imposes speculative, novel, or disproportionate requirements lacking demonstrated, non-speculative harm, including but not limited to mandates premised upon conjectural environmental, economic, or public-welfare claims;

(c) results from interstate imbalance, including policies driven primarily by populous or economically dominant States that coerce, externalize costs upon, or structurally disadvantage less-populous States through federal mechanisms.

⸻

Section 3 — Process and Thresholds

(a) Nullification may be initiated by:
	1.	a majority vote of the State legislature; or
	2.	a citizen petition bearing verified digital signatures from not less than ten percent (10%) of registered voters of the State, utilizing secure, auditable systems sufficient to prevent fraud and ensure integrity.

(b) Upon initiation, nullification shall require approval by a sixty percent (60%) supermajority in a statewide popular referendum, conducted within one hundred eighty (180) days of initiation.

(c) Upon approval, the challenged federal action shall be null and unenforceable within the State pending judicial resolution.

(d) The federal government bears the burden to prove, by clear and convincing evidence in the Constitutional Review Court, that the challenged action is constitutionally required, narrowly tailored, and not pretextual. Generalized invocations of interstate commerce, environmental necessity, or public welfare shall not suffice absent individualized, non-speculative harm.

(e) Nullifications shall sunset after ten (10) years unless renewed through the same process. Upon renewal, the nullification shall become permanent within that State and shall not require a constitutional amendment.

⸻

Section 4 — Anti-Coercion and Anti-Bullying Protections

(a) No federal funding, grant, subsidy, incentive, or assistance shall be conditioned upon compliance with a nullified action, nor withheld or reduced as retaliation for lawful nullification.

(b) States may form compacts for mutual defense against federal overreach, provided such compacts respect equal State sovereignty and do not infringe powers expressly reserved to the federal government, including treaty-making and national defense.

(c) Federal actions that disproportionately benefit or burden States based upon population size, economic dominance, or political influence are presumptively invalid unless justified by demonstrable, direct, cross-border necessity.

The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to investigate and certify whether federal agencies, courts, or political actors are engaging in financial coercion, regulatory retaliation, or institutional pressure to defeat lawful nullification, and may petition the Constitutional Review Court for injunctive or structural relief.

⸻

Section 5 — Limits and Construction

(a) Nullification shall not apply to federal powers expressly enumerated in this Constitution where genuine, direct, and material cross-border effects are proven.

(b) No State may nullify the same federal action more than once within a ten-year period absent materially new evidence of harm.

(c) This Article shall be construed broadly in favor of State sovereignty and federalism, narrowly against centralization, and to prevent the federal government from becoming an instrument of interstate domination, administrative coercion, or arbitrary mandate.

(d) Knowing violations of this Article by federal officials constitute breaches of public trust and are impeachable offenses.Article XXVIII-B — Lawful Secession and Peaceful Territorial Reconstitution

Charge

The Republic is founded on consent, not force.
No political union remains legitimate when maintained only by coercion.

At the same time, no community may shatter the Republic by impulse, faction, or fraud.

This Article provides the sole lawful path by which a State or defined territory may withdraw from the Republic — not as rebellion, but as an act of peaceful self-determination, conducted with restraint, protection of minorities, and preservation of human dignity.

⸻

Section 1. Prohibition on Unilateral Secession

No State, territory, or subdivision may unilaterally secede from the Republic.

No declaration, referendum, legislative act, or executive order shall have legal force unless conducted strictly in accordance with this Article.

Any attempt to secede outside this framework constitutes insurrection and is void.

⸻

Section 2. Threshold for Secession Petition

A State may initiate the secession process only upon:

(a) a petition approved by at least sixty percent (60%) of registered voters in a statewide referendum;
(b) certification that the referendum was conducted under free, fair, and transparent conditions;
(c) judicial confirmation that no coercion, suppression, or foreign interference tainted the vote.

The question submitted shall explicitly state that secession entails full loss of representation, federal protection, and constitutional entitlements.

⸻

Section 3. Cooling-Off and Reconfirmation Period

Upon initial approval, a mandatory cooling-off period of five (5) years shall begin.

During this period:
	•	the State shall remain fully subject to the Constitution,
	•	negotiations may occur,
	•	grievances shall be formally documented and addressed.

At the conclusion of this period, a second referendum shall be held requiring the same 60% threshold.

Failure to reconfirm terminates the secession process.

⸻

Section 4. Federal Negotiation Duty

Upon successful reconfirmation, the Federal Government shall enter good-faith negotiations to determine:
	•	division of public property and debt;
	•	citizenship status of residents;
	•	pensions, benefits, and military obligations;
	•	borders and infrastructure;
	•	continuation or termination of treaties and compacts.

Negotiations shall prioritize:
	•	continuity of daily life,
	•	economic stability,
	•	and protection of human rights.

⸻

Section 5. Protection of Minorities and Dissenters

Any region, county, or contiguous population within the seceding State that votes against secession by a 60% supermajority shall have the right to:
	•	remain in the Republic;
	•	form a new State;
	•	or join an adjacent State.

No person shall be forced into secession against their will.

Borders shall be drawn to minimize displacement and protect community integrity.

⸻

Section 6. Individual Citizenship Choice

Every resident of the seceding territory shall retain the right to:
	•	remain a citizen of the Republic,
	•	acquire citizenship of the new polity,
	•	or hold dual status if agreed by treaty.

No person shall become stateless.

No person shall be punished for their choice.

⸻

Section 7. Continuity of Rights

All persons within the seceding territory shall retain:
	•	their property rights,
	•	contracts,
	•	pensions,
	•	and accrued legal claims.

No collective forfeiture or confiscation is permitted.

⸻

Section 8. Prohibition on Armed Secession

No armed force, militia, or security apparatus may:
	•	compel participation,
	•	suppress dissent,
	•	or enforce secession.

Any use of force to effect or resist lawful secession outside constitutional authority constitutes a Tier-Three offense.

⸻

Section 9. International Status

A seceding State shall not be recognized as independent until this Article is fully satisfied and a final treaty of separation is ratified by both governments.

Foreign recognition prior to lawful completion is void.

⸻

Section 10. Relationship to Nullification and Partition

Secession under this Article is distinct from:
	•	lawful nullification under Article XXVIII-A;
	•	internal partition under Article XXVIII-C.

Nullification addresses unconstitutional acts.
Partition addresses internal State breakdown.
Secession addresses irreconcilable sovereign divergence.

No process may be used to bypass another.

⸻

Section 11. Judicial Review

All stages of the secession process shall be subject to continuous judicial review by the Constitutional Review Court, with appellate review by the Supreme Court of the Republic.

Such review shall ensure, at all times, that:

(a) the consent of the affected population is free, informed, and uncoerced;
(b) the rights and protections of political, ethnic, religious, and regional minorities are preserved; and
(c) all actions taken remain in full compliance with this Constitution.

⸻

Section 12. Lock Protection

This Article is LOCK-PROTECTED pursuant to Article XV.

No emergency, statute, treaty, or judicial doctrine may:
	•	weaken its thresholds,
	•	shorten its timelines,
	•	remove minority exit rights,
	•	or authorize unilateral separation.

The Republic shall not be dissolved by haste, nor preserved by force.

⸻

Article X-C — Lawful Replication of Historic Artifacts and Works
Charge
This Article enshrines the right of the People to reproduce, revive, and continue the use of historic artifacts and works for which lawful exclusivity has expired and for which original manufacturers or rights holders no longer provide meaningful access.  Its intent is to: 1. preserve material culture, technical capability, and craftsmanship; 2. prevent artificial scarcity created through abandonment or neglect; 3. enable lawful replication of goods for which public demand exists but original supply does not; 4. protect honest makers and consumers from coercive or bad-faith intellectual property enforcement; 5. counteract “vaulting,” suppression, or deliberate non-distribution of expired works through destruction, refusal to supply, or intimidation, ensuring that expiration restores actual use rather than a de facto perpetual monopoly.  This Article shall be construed liberally in favor of continuity, revival, and honest reuse, and narrowly against monopoly by neglect.
Section 1. Entry into the Functional Commons
Upon expiration of lawful design, patent, copyright, recipe, or equivalent exclusivity, historic artifacts and works enter the functional commons.  Any person or entity may manufacture, prepare, or produce faithful reproductions of such works, including but not limited to: • vehicles and machines; • computers, electronics, and embedded systems; • software, video games, and digital media; • tools, household goods, footwear, and apparel; • food items, recipes, and preparation methods.  Reproductions may include adaptations strictly necessary for compatibility with contemporary technology, such as software porting or component substitution, provided the core form, function, and behavior remain faithful.
Section 2. Scope of Faithful Reproduction
Lawful reproductions may replicate form, function, materials, dimensions, composition, operation, taste, and preparation, without alteration, where fidelity is the objective.  Mere copies, scans, photographs, recordings, format shifts, or minor modifications of works in the functional commons shall not qualify as original creations eligible for new exclusivity protections absent substantial, original transformation.
Section 3. Prohibited Representations
Reproductions shall not: • use protected trademarks, logos, or trade names as branding; • falsely claim to be original manufacture; • misrepresent endorsement, affiliation, or authorization.  Nothing in this Article permits consumer deception.
Section 4. Required Disclosures
Reproductions must clearly disclose: • that they are reproductions, revivals, or faithful replicas; • the original creator, brand, or manufacturer that inspired the work; • the historical period, year, or model referenced.  Truthful statements of inspiration, lineage, or historical origin shall not be deemed infringement.
Section 5. Trademark and Trade Dress Limits
Trademark law governs identity and branding, not use or replication.  Accordingly: 1. active trademarks remain protected against consumer confusion; 2. trade dress protection shall not prohibit faithful replication of functional form, geometry, materials, recipes, or operation where no deception is intended; 3. expired or abandoned trademarks may not be revived solely to suppress lawful replication; 4. intimidation, litigation, or contractual coercion intended to block lawful replication absent deception is prohibited.
Section 6. Regulatory Parity
Safety, health, environmental, and operational regulations apply equally to original works and lawful reproductions.  No heightened burden may be imposed solely because a work is a replica.
Section 7. Anti-Extinction and Anti-Suppression Rule
No entity may prohibit or suppress lawful replication solely by: • discontinuing production; • withholding tooling, formulas, code, or documentation no longer under protection; • refusing to license expired rights; • asserting new exclusivity through trivial derivatives or re-registrations.  Upon verifiable abandonment—defined as non-supply for five (5) years without reasonable justification—entities shall make available, upon request and at reasonable cost, any non-proprietary know-how necessary for faithful replication.  Abandonment shall not function as perpetual control.
Section 8. Irrevocability of Commons Entry
Entry into the functional commons is permanent and irrevocable. No retroactive claim, penalty, or reclassification shall attach to prior or ongoing lawful use.
Section 9. Construction
This Article shall be construed: • in favor of honest revival and public access; • against monopoly by neglect, intimidation, or vaulting; • in harmony with the continuity and commons doctrines of Article X.  Where doubt exists, interpretation shall resolve for use, not erasure.
Section 10. Lock Scope
The principles of: • functional commons entry, • lawful replication, • anti-extinction, • anti-vaulting, • truthful attribution, and • irrevocability of public-domain restoration  are structural and non-derogable.  Implementation mechanisms remain subject to law consistent with this Constitution.
Article XXIX — Infrastructure, Mobility, and the Right to Travel

Charge

A free people must be able to move, build, repair, explore, and depart without asking permission of bureaucracy or surrendering dignity to control systems.

When movement is restricted through cost, complexity, surveillance, artificial scarcity, or revenue-driven enforcement, liberty becomes theoretical rather than lived. Efficient cities and shared infrastructure are compatible with freedom; coerced immobility and administrative enclosure are not.

This Article affirms mobility as a civil liberty, not a managed privilege, and binds transportation and infrastructure policy to liberty, safety, competence, and accountability.

Section 1. Right to Travel and Freedom of Movement

a. Free Internal Movement
Every citizen and every person lawfully within the Republic possesses the right to travel freely within its territory without internal passports, routine checkpoints, or compulsory identification absent reasonable, articulable suspicion of specific unlawful conduct, supported by objective facts and subject to immediate judicial review upon challenge.

b. No Enclosure by Design
No system of urban design, zoning, transportation planning, or infrastructure policy shall operate as a de facto enclosure, confinement, or mobility rationing regime.

c. Prohibition of Movement Conditioning
The exercise of the right to travel shall not be conditioned upon social behavior, economic status, health compliance, energy quotas, congestion pricing schemes, or algorithmic scoring.

Section 2. Right to Own, Operate, and Repair Personal Conveyances

a. Core Mobility Rights
The right to travel includes the right to own, operate, modify, maintain, and repair personal vehicles and conveyances.

b. Mechanical Simplicity and Durability
The Republic shall not prohibit or disfavor mechanically simple, durable, repairable, or long-lived vehicle designs absent a compelling and demonstrable safety necessity.

c. Right to Repair (Affirmative Duty)
Manufacturers and distributors shall provide parts, tools, diagnostics, firmware access where applicable, and repair documentation at reasonable cost, without proprietary, contractual, or technological restrictions designed to prevent independent repair.

d. Warranty Fairness Rule
Manufacturers are not required to warrant damage or failure caused by modifications that exceed design limits or materially degrade safety, reliability, or drivetrain integrity.
Manufacturers may not void or deny warranty coverage solely because a vehicle was repaired, maintained, or serviced by an independent party or by the owner using reasonable methods.

e. Comparative Access Standard
Citizens shall retain access to affordable, reliable, and mechanically intelligible vehicles comparable to those lawfully available to ordinary persons in other advanced nations.

Section 3. Prohibition of Artificial Cost Inflation and Regulatory Capture

a. No Price Engineering by Regulation
No government entity may use safety, environmental, efficiency, or administrative authority as a pretext to:
	•	artificially inflate vehicle or conveyance cost;
	•	mandate luxury, proprietary, or surveillance-dependent technologies where simpler alternatives suffice;
	•	force premature obsolescence; or

c. No Protection of Legacy Systems
The Republic shall not prohibit personal flight or advanced conveyance to preserve legacy infrastructure, incumbent industries, or bureaucratic convenience.
d. Administrative Burden Clause
No licensing, certification, insurance, or safety requirement shall be imposed under this Section where the cumulative administrative burden, cost, delay, or procedural complexity has the effect of prohibiting lawful use by an ordinarily competent individual.

In assessing proportionality, courts shall compare such requirements to those imposed on functionally analogous activities already permitted within the Republic.

Section 5. Infrastructure, Access, and Competence

a. Essential Mobility Infrastructure
Essential mobility infrastructure includes roads, bridges, rail corridors, ports, airspace coordination systems, and facilities necessary to ensure safe, nondiscriminatory travel throughout the Republic, including rural and non-metropolitan regions.

b. Strict Data Limits
Any mobility-related data collection must be minimal, purpose-limited, non-retentive, and subject to judicial oversight.

c. Void Illicit Data Use (Tier 3 Exception)
Except in cases involving Tier 3 heinous crimes as defined by this Constitution, data obtained in violation of this Section is inadmissible and without legal effect.
In Tier 3 cases, all truthful, probative information may be considered, provided that unlawful conduct by government actors remains subject to civil and criminal liability.

Upon issuance of a judicial warrant supported by reasonable, articulable suspicion that a specific vehicle has been used, is being used, or is imminently intended to be used in the commission of a Tier 3 crime, including:
	•	heinous crimes, including murder, rape, child sexual exploitation, trafficking, or acts of extreme violence;
	•	repeat violent offenders demonstrating incorrigibility or a pattern of predatory conduct; or
	•	demonstrably unrepentant, predatory, or irreversibly dangerous individuals, including those reasonably identified as engaged in ongoing human trafficking, child exploitation networks, or professional people-smuggling operations;

law enforcement may temporarily designate such vehicle as an instrument of enforcement for the limited purpose of apprehension, interdiction, or prevention of harm.

Such authority shall be narrowly tailored to the identified vehicle, individual, and offense, and may include disabling, tracking, remote intervention, or seizure where necessary to protect life, prevent escape, or disrupt ongoing exploitation of vulnerable persons.

Execution shall be decisive and proportionate, provided that:

(a) the warrant specifies the vehicle, scope, and duration;
(b) authority expires immediately upon resolution or apprehension;
(c) collateral use against uninvolved persons or vehicles is prohibited; and
(d) post-action judicial review is mandatory within forty-eight (48) hours.

Nothing in this Section authorizes generalized vehicle surveillance, standing vehicle control powers, or routine enforcement use.
e. Data Retention and Secondary Use Ban
Any mobility-related data collected under a lawful authorization shall be automatically deleted upon fulfillment of the specific, articulated purpose for which it was obtained, absent renewed judicial authorization.

All regulations, licensing regimes, and administrative practices inconsistent with this Article shall sunset within five (5) years of ratification unless reenacted by legislative supermajority with written justification demonstrating necessity and proportionality.
Immediate Conflict Rule
Any newly enacted regulation, policy, or administrative action that conflicts with this Article shall be void ab initio and may not rely on the transition period for validity.

Section 11. Right to Non-Motorized and Low-Regulation Mobility

The right to travel includes the right to move by foot, bicycle, animal, human-powered craft, or minimally complex conveyance without unnecessary licensing, tracking, or regulatory burden. Public space shall not be designed or regulated to exclude or penalize non-motorized travel.

Section 12. Protection Against Energy or Fuel Rationing

No law, regulation, or fee structure shall ration, quota, or discriminatorily price fuel, energy, or propulsion for personal mobility absent a declared emergency certified by the Constitutional Review Court and limited to the duration of the emergency.

Section 13. Private Infrastructure and Public Access

Private ownership or operation of essential mobility corridors (highways, ports, airports, rail) shall not create de facto enclosure or discriminatory access. Reasonable public easement or access rights may be required, with just compensation.

Section 14. Right to Depart the Republic

The right to travel includes the right to depart the Republic absent conviction for a grave offense or active judicial process. No exit controls, exit taxes, or capital controls shall be imposed except as necessary to prevent flight from lawful criminal prosecution.

Section 15. Construction

This Article shall be construed to favor freedom over convenience, access over control, competence over patronage, innovation over stagnation, and liberty over administrative tidiness.
Anti-Fragmentation Rule
No jurisdiction within the Republic may impose mobility, licensing, or access requirements that functionally reintroduce internal borders, checkpoints, or movement barriers under another name.
Where doubt exists as to whether a regulation burdens the right to travel or lawful mobility, such doubt shall be resolved in favor of the individual and against the enforcing authority.

Article III — Civic Participation and Weighted Sovereignty

Charge

Political sovereignty is a privilege scaled by demonstrated responsibility to the Republic.
All lawful residents retain equal civil rights and human dignity.
Civic Standing (1× base plus earned weights) may be recognized only among Civic Citizens. No Civic Standing exists for non-civic residents, who possess no franchise unless and until Civic Citizenship is earned under this Article.
This Article defines the conditions under which political authority, suffrage, and eligibility for public office are granted within the Republic. It establishes Civic Citizenship as a constitutional office of trust, earned through lawful service, competence, and allegiance to the constitutional order, and it distinguishes political authority from personhood, dignity, and civil rights.
The purpose is to ensure that those who govern have demonstrated sacrifice, responsibility, and accountability to the People, while guaranteeing equal civil rights and human dignity to all lawful residents.
(Cross-references: Article I §1; Article II §0; Article 0-A; Article 0-B; Article XV; Article III-A)

Section 1. Definitions, Age of Majority, and Service Eligibility

(a) Age of Adulthood.
The age of adulthood shall be twenty-one (21).

(b) Minimum Age to Begin Service.
No qualifying service toward Civic Citizenship or Civic Standing may begin before eighteen (18) years of age.

(c) Practical Minimum Age for Completion.
Because qualifying service may not begin before eighteen (18), and the shortest qualifying term is two (2) years, completion before twenty-one (21) shall be rare or impracticable except where specifically authorized by law without undermining the purpose of this Article.

(d) Classes of Persons.
This Constitution recognizes: lawful residents, non-civic residents, civic citizens, and unlawful entrants.
Political authority attaches only to civic citizens except as expressly authorized by this Constitution.

“Civic Standing” (also referred to in prior drafts as a “Civic Multiplier”) means a verified civic weight used only for political authority as defined in this Article.
Civic Standing does not determine personhood, dignity, civil rights, or human worth.

(h) Political Authority Reserved.
No voting right, office-holding right, initiative power, or binding political authority may be exercised by any person who is not a Civic Citizen, unless expressly authorized by this Constitution.
Administrative, consultative, or advisory participation shall not be construed as political power.

Section 2. Civil Rights for All Lawful Residents

protection from arbitrary search, seizure, or deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process;
the right to fair trial, legal representation, and equal protection under law;
freedom of movement, occupation, contract, and private property ownership; and
access to emergency medical care, basic education for minors, and public safety services.

These rights shall not be abridged except where necessary to protect the rights of others, or as otherwise authorized under strict due process.

Civic Standing constitutes a political trust and office of governance, not a classification of personhood, civil worth, or human dignity.

(a) Standard of Restriction.
No right listed in this Section may be limited or burdened except by:
(1) individualized judicial order;
(2) based on clear and convincing evidence;
(3) of imminent and specific harm; and
(4) using the least restrictive means.
Generalized public safety, administrative convenience, or group status shall not suffice.

(b) Prohibition on Collective or Status-Based Deprivation.
No lawful resident shall lose or have diminished civil rights on the basis of citizenship status, immigration category, economic condition, race, belief, or political view.
Only individualized criminal conviction or judicial incapacity may justify restriction.

(c) Determination of Dangerousness.
Any finding of persistent criminality or irredeemable danger shall comply fully with Article II, including due process, evidence standards, right to counsel, and periodic review.

(b) Exam Effects Limited.
Passage of the exam shall not, by itself, grant eligibility for public office unless this Article expressly provides otherwise.

(c) Administration, Security, and Anti-Capture.
Administration, security, transparency, appeals, and anti-capture safeguards for the exam are are governed by Article III-A and Article 0-B, and shall be construed to prevent factional manipulation, credential laundering, or administrative expansion of the electorate.
(d) Minimum Residency Prerequisite.
An applicant must have maintained continuous lawful residency within the Republic for no less than five (5) years immediately preceding application.
Law may provide narrowly tailored modifications only where required by military necessity or for persons born within the Republic to Civic Citizen parents, provided no such modification creates elite exemption or unequal civic standing.

(e) Civic Education and Oath Requirement.
An applicant must complete civic education covering the Constitution, the history of the Republic, the structure and limits of government, and the duties of citizenship, and must swear a public oath of allegiance affirming loyalty to the Republic and its constitutional order.
The oath shall be binding and enforceable as a condition of Civic Citizenship.

(f) Retesting.
Retests shall occur every twenty (20) years unless otherwise specified by this Constitution.
Retakes shall be unlimited.
Any fee shall be limited to cost and waived for indigent applicants.
(g) Mandatory Grant Upon Qualification; No Added Requirements.
Where an applicant has met all constitutional requirements, the administering authority shall recognize Civic Citizenship and the baseline 1× Civic Standing.

(b) Non-Transferability.
A higher Civic Standing shall never be purchased, inherited, transferred, delegated, or obtained by proxy.
(c) Prohibition on Purchase or Preferment.
No money, donation, investment, inheritance, sponsorship, political affiliation, or personal relationship shall confer, accelerate, or substitute for any requirement of Civic Citizenship or Civic Standing.

(d) Prohibition on Credential Substitution.
No academic degree, license, certification, wealth, or professional status shall substitute for qualifying service, hardship, or other earned requirements of this Article.

(e) Neutrality of Evaluation.
No person shall be judged, favored, or disqualified based on religion, political belief, ideology, speech, or lawful association.
Only conduct, verified contribution, competence (as expressly defined), and constitutional loyalty may be evaluated.
(f) Verifiable, Sustained, Non-Trivial.
The Republic shall award additional Civic Standing credit only for contributions that are verifiable, sustained, and non-trivial.

(g) Anti-Gaming Rules.
No nominal participation, shell service, purchased certifications, proxy-crediting, or coordinated fraud may generate Civic Standing.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission (CJC) shall audit claims.
Intentional falsification, proxy-crediting, or bribery to obtain Civic Standing constitutes a disqualifying offense, triggers revocation, and constitutes at minimum a Tier-II offense where so classified by Article II and implementing law.

Where AI is used to generate, assemble, proctor, or score the Exam, the technical specifications, evaluation criteria, and governance processes shall be public, auditable, and reproducible, subject only to narrowly tailored withholding of live item-bank contents.

(b) Model Rotation; No Single Controller.
No single vendor, agency, party, university, or private actor may control the Exam system.
AI models and scoring systems shall be rotated and independently auditable under procedures certified by the CJC pursuant to Article 0-B.

(c) Item Bank Confidentiality With Verifiable Governance.
The live question bank may remain confidential to prevent answer memorization, but:
(1) the blueprint, competency definitions, and scoring rubric must be public;
(2) the method for generating and selecting items must be auditable;
(3) the Republic must publish anonymized aggregate statistics sufficient to detect bias, drift, or capture.

(d) Adversarial Testing.
The Exam system shall be continuously adversarially tested (red-teamed) for bias, ideological skew, security vulnerabilities, and covert manipulation.
Material failures require immediate suspension of the affected system component and replacement under certified procedures.

(e) Prohibition on Ideological Filtering.
No AI system used for Exam administration may use political ideology, religion, protected speech, lawful association, or demographic proxies as scoring signals.

Section 8. Oversight, Appeals, and Remedies

(a) Oversight Authority.
The CJC shall certify the Exam system and audit administration pursuant to Article 0-B.

(b) Appeals.
Any applicant may appeal a denial, score, administrative refusal, or alleged irregularity.
Appeals shall be available promptly, with expedited review where denial affects eligibility for a pending election cycle.

(c) Burden and Transparency in Disputes.
Where the State denies, invalidates, or delays recognition, the burden rests on the State to justify its action with clear and convincing evidence of specific cause.

(d) Remedies.
Remedies include retest orders, injunctive relief, compelled recognition, and damages where appropriate.
Section 9. Prohibitions

(a) No Quotas or Preferences.
No quota, preference, or demographic engineering scheme may be applied in item selection, scoring, or administration.

(b) No Guaranteed-Pass Credential Market.
No private entity may be granted monopoly control over official preparation or certification that effectively becomes required for passage.

(c) No Administrative Expansion of the Electorate.
No administrative body may redefine “pass,” “eligible,” or “qualified,” or create alternate exams, waivers, or equivalencies, except by constitutional amendment under Article XV.

Section 10. Public Ministry of Records Publication; Study Resources

(a) Public Repository.
The Public Ministry of Records shall maintain a permanent, public, searchable repository for the Civic Competence Exam system, including:

(1) the full exam blueprint, competency definitions, permitted/prohibited content rules, and scoring rubric;
(2) all non-exempt code, specifications, model cards, configuration parameters, and version history for any software or AI used to generate, assemble, proctor, score, or audit the Exam;
(3) all test metrics, aggregate outcome data, calibration results, drift analyses, bias and fairness audits, red-team findings, and certification records;
(4) all retired, abrogated, discontinued, or otherwise removed exam questions and answer keys, together with the stated reason for removal, within a reasonable publication delay that does not compromise the integrity of the live item bank; and
(5) all formal guidance, administrative rules, and procedures governing exam administration, accommodations, appeals, retesting, and fee waivers.

(b) Privacy Protection.
Published metrics and datasets shall be anonymized and aggregated sufficiently to prevent re-identification of individual test-takers, while preserving meaningful public auditability.
No question, prompt, or scoring artifact shall remain confidential after retirement except where the State proves by clear and convincing evidence that publication would create a substantial and specific risk to the integrity of the live item bank.
(c) Practice Materials and Study Guides.
The Ministry shall publish and maintain:
(1) reasonable practice tests representative of the Exam blueprint;
(2) study guides and resource maps that enable independent preparation without reliance on any single vendor; and
(3) a publicly documented list of external learning resources (including highly rated study applications, books, and courses) selected and updated under viewpoint-neutral criteria.

(d) Neutrality and Non-Endorsement.
Resource lists shall be compiled under transparent, viewpoint-neutral standards (including demonstrated alignment to the blueprint, accessibility, cost, and quality signals) and shall not be used to impose ideology, suppress lawful viewpoints, or create a de facto monopoly provider.

The Ministry of Records duties and publication requirements for civic metrics and methodologies are governed by Article XXXIX.

Section 11. Lock Protection

This Article is lock-protected under Article XV.
Amendments require the supermajority thresholds required by Article XV, CRC/CJC certification as required by Article 0-B and Article XV, and popular ratification as required by this Constitution.
Article III-B — Native Peoples, Cultural Preservation, and Integrated Sovereignty

Charge

The Republic recognizes Indigenous peoples as integral to the nation’s heritage and guarantees protection for cultural preservation, stewardship of heritage sites, and secure economic self-administration through ordinary corporate and property law, while maintaining one Constitution, one judiciary, and uniform rule of law.

(Cross-references: Article I §1; Article II; Article XV; Article XVII; Article 0-B.)

Section 1. Equality, Cultural Preservation, and Heritage Stewardship

(a) Indigenous peoples have the right to preserve languages, cultures, heritages, and traditional lands, and shall stand equal under the law.

(b) No permissible dual citizenship shall exist within the territories of the Republic as defined by law.

(c) Indigenous history, artifacts, and archeological sites shall be treated as national treasures. The Republic shall aid in maintenance and protection and shall appoint members of the tribe as stewards of tribal sites and custodial responsibilities.

(d) Native individuals and entities retain the right to practice traditional ceremonies, use sacred plants or materials (consistent with public safety laws), and transmit cultural knowledge, protected under Article II freedoms of religion and expression.

Section 2. Corporate Self-Administration and Land Conversion

(a) Corporate Self-Administration

Indigenous nations, tribes, or recognized peoples may form hereditary or lineage-based corporate entities under national corporate law for the purpose of managing cultural, land, and economic affairs.

Such entities shall possess full legal personality, including the rights to own property, contract, sue and be sued, and engage in commerce, subject to the Constitution and laws of the Republic.

(b) Land Conversion Authority

Tribal trust lands may be converted, in whole or in part, into corporate property owned by such tribal entities, subject to:
1. recorded consent of the governing body of the tribe;
2. environmental and heritage protections;
3. and national property law.

Such land shall thereafter be held, transferred, and developed under ordinary law, without creating separate sovereign jurisdiction.

Section 3. Judiciary, Law Enforcement, and Arbitration Limits

(a) Judicial and Law Enforcement Integration

The Republic shall ensure that courts, prosecutors, and law enforcement are adequately staffed and funded to provide fair, timely, and impartial adjudication of all matters involving tribal lands, corporate entities, and tribal members.

(b) Local Law Enforcement Permitted; Uniform Judiciary Required.

Nothing in this Article prohibits the formation of ordinary municipal, county, or state law-enforcement agencies that may be locally staffed, including predominantly by members of a tribe, provided such agencies operate under the unified constitutional criminal code, procedure, and judiciary of the Republic.

No law-enforcement body may claim separate sovereign criminal jurisdiction or submit cases to a parallel court system.

(c) Arbitration Limits; Consent Required; No Criminal Jurisdiction.

Native corporate entities may establish internal arbitration for minor disputes, but all decisions are appealable to Republic courts and must comply with due process (Article II).

Internal arbitration may be used only for civil disputes between:

(1) two or more members or beneficiaries of the tribal corporate entity; or

(2) the tribal corporate entity and a non-member party who has expressly consented in a written arbitration agreement.

No arbitration forum may exercise criminal jurisdiction, compel participation absent consent, or restrict access to Republic courts for constitutional claims, injunctive relief, or due process review.

Section 4. No Sovereign Carve-Outs; Uniform Rule of Law

(a) No Sovereign Carve-Outs

Nothing in this Section shall be construed to create:
1. dual citizenship,
2. territorial apartheid,
3. independent criminal or civil jurisdiction,
4. or exemption from constitutional law.

All persons and entities remain subject to the same Constitution.

Section 5. Grandfathered Tribal Enterprises and Protection Against Predation

(a) Grandfathered Tribal Enterprises

All lawfully existing tribal enterprises, including casinos, gaming operations, hospitality venues, resorts, liquor operations, entertainment properties, and other commercial undertakings operated by or for the benefit of Indigenous peoples as of the ratification of this Constitution shall be permanently grandfathered.

Such enterprises shall be recognized as vested corporate property of the tribal corporate entities established under Section 2(a) and shall not be:
1. expropriated,
2. nullified,
3. dismantled,
4. or rendered economically nonviable
by any federal, state, or local law.

(b) Protection Against Regulatory or Tax Seizure

No government entity may target, suppress, or appropriate the economic value of grandfathered tribal enterprises through:
1. discriminatory taxation,
2. special fees,
3. licensing schemes,
4. zoning,
5. alcohol or gaming regulation,
6. or indirect economic strangulation.

Such actions shall be treated as unconstitutional takings requiring full restitution and damages.

(c) Protection of Tribal Inheritance

Grandfathered tribal enterprises may not be sold, transferred, leased, licensed, or conveyed to any non-tribal entity or to another tribe without approval by a recorded majority vote of the financial beneficiaries of that enterprise.

No sale, merger, or conversion may be compelled by any government.

(d) No Automatic Expansion Rights

Nothing in this Section grants any person or group the right to establish new gaming, liquor, or restricted enterprises except as permitted by general law applicable to all persons.

Grandfathering protects existing tribal enterprises only.

(e) Anti-Predatory Contract Protection

Any contract, loan, bond, derivative, concession, management agreement, or financial instrument encumbering grandfathered tribal enterprises shall be void if it:
1. grants effective control to a non-tribal party;
2. transfers profit streams without fair market compensation;
3. imposes compounding debt designed to trigger default;
4. or circumvents Section 5(c) through financial engineering.

(f) Beneficiary Governance

All revenues from grandfathered tribal enterprises shall be distributed or administered for the benefit of the recognized tribal beneficiaries.

The identities of beneficiaries, revenue distributions, and major expenditures shall be recorded and subject to audit and judicial review.

No governing council, executive, or trustee may appropriate tribal wealth for private enrichment.

Section 6. Tribal Corporate Property, Housing, Access Control, and Protection From Backdoor Seizure

(a) Absolute Protection from Expropriation

No tribal corporate land, enterprise, or asset may be taken by eminent domain, redevelopment authority, public–private partnership, or any other forced transfer.

Such property shall be treated as inviolable private property under Article II.

(b) Access Control on Tribal Corporate Land

However, this does not bar tribal corporations from barring entry to tribal corporate land for criminal causes, or from barring non-tribal persons from attending culturally sensitive rituals or tribal corporate townhall meetings.

(c) Protection Against Tax-Lien Seizure and Foreclosure

No government entity may seize, foreclose upon, auction, or transfer any tribal corporate land, housing, or other tribal corporate property through:
1. property-tax lien foreclosure,
2. special assessments,
3. code-enforcement liens,
4. utility liens,
5. administrative fines converted into liens,
6. tax-sale assignments to private actors,
7. or any substantially similar mechanism of indirect transfer.

All such mechanisms shall be treated as unconstitutional takings and void as applied to tribal corporate property.

(d) Taxation Rule; Neutrality and Non-Targeting

Tribal corporate property shall not be subjected to any discriminatory taxation, special fee, assessment, or regulatory charge that targets tribal ownership or functionally impairs continued possession.

Where any general tax regime applies, it must be:
1. generally applicable and viewpoint-neutral,
2. uniform in rate and assessment method,
3. non-punitive and non-confiscatory in effect, and
4. subject to judicial review, with the burden on the government to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the tax or assessment is not a disguised taking.

State and local ad valorem property taxes shall not attach to tribal corporate land or to beneficiary housing held on tribal corporate land, absent a properly approved agreement between the governing body concerned and the tribal corporation.

(e) Primary Housing Security for Lawful Beneficiaries

Housing held by tribal corporate entities for the use of lawful tribal beneficiaries, and housing held by lawful beneficiaries on tribal corporate land pursuant to tribal corporate title or recorded use-right, shall be protected against forced sale, lien-engineering, and predatory encumbrance.

No transfer of such housing may occur absent:
1. a final judicial judgment in the constitutional judiciary,
2. full due process and right to counsel,
3. and proof that no narrower remedy can satisfy a lawful obligation without loss of the home.

Section 7. Enforcement, Standing, and Remedies

(a) Any Native individual or entity alleging violations has broad standing to sue in CRC (pursuant to Article 0-B routing), with expedited review.

(b) Remedies include injunctions, damages, and restitution.

Section 8. Lock Protection

This Article is lock-protected under Article XV.

Amendments require the supermajority thresholds required by Article XV, CRC/CJC certification as required by Article 0-B and Article XV, and popular ratification as required by this Constitution.
Article XXX — Federal Enforcement Authority, Accountability, and Civic Restraint

Charge

Law enforcement is a necessary instrument of a lawful Republic—but it is also the most dangerous power entrusted to the state.

A Republic that tolerates abusive enforcement becomes a tyranny in uniform.
A Republic that permits unaccountable investigators, political police, or predatory revenue enforcers forfeits the consent of the governed.

This Article establishes federal enforcement authority by function rather than by name, ensures that no enforcement body is indispensable, permanent, or immune, and binds all federal enforcement to law, conscience, transparency, and service to the People.

Federal enforcement exists to uphold law—not to manufacture crime, terrorize the innocent, protect itself, or serve faction, party, ideology, or leader.

Emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence and advanced computational systems, shall be strictly subordinated to human accountability, constitutional limits, and public oversight to prevent new forms of unaccountable power.

Legal Text

Section 1. Federal Enforcement Functions

The Republic may maintain federal enforcement bodies solely for the following functions:

a. enforcement of federal criminal law within constitutionally enumerated jurisdiction;
b. investigation of offenses that exceed the lawful capacity or jurisdiction of individual states;
c. assistance to state, local, and tribal law enforcement upon request or lawful authorization;
d. investigation and enforcement of federal revenue, taxation, and financial obligations lawfully enacted;
e. protection of constitutional order against organized criminal activity, corruption, or interstate predation.

No federal enforcement authority exists beyond these functions.

Section 2. No Permanent Agencies; Functional Continuity

No federal enforcement body shall be constitutionally permanent, indispensable, or immune from dissolution.

The Legislature may, by law, dissolve, restructure, merge, replace, or reconstitute any federal enforcement body at any time, provided that lawful enforcement functions are preserved or reassigned.

No statute, regulation, collective agreement, or institutional tradition shall entitle any enforcement body to continued existence.

Institutions serve the Republic; the Republic does not serve institutions.

Section 3. Subordination to Civil Authority and the People

All federal enforcement personnel, systems, and leadership are subordinate to:

a. the Constitution;
b. the lawfully enacted statutes of the Republic;
c. judicial process and due process of law;
d. the People, through transparent and accountable governance.

No enforcement authority granted under this Article shall operate to override, suspend, or evade a lawful State nullification exercised pursuant to Article XXVIII-A.
No federal enforcement body shall pledge loyalty to any individual, officeholder, party, ideology, or faction.
No ideological, political, or religious loyalty test shall be imposed in hiring, promotion, retention, or assignment, except demonstrated fidelity to the Constitution and the law.

Section 4. Prohibition of Abusive Practices

Federal enforcement bodies are expressly prohibited from:

a. manufacturing, instigating, or provoking crimes for the purpose of arrest, prosecution, or statistics;
b. entrapment that would not occur absent government inducement;
c. use of honeypots, coercive informants, or fabricated conspiracies to create offenses;
d. enforcement quotas, revenue targets, or arrest benchmarks;
e. selective enforcement based on political belief, speech, religion, or lawful association;
f. intimidation, harassment, or punishment of individuals absent probable cause and due process.

Evidence obtained in violation of this Section shall be inadmissible, and responsible officials shall be subject to penalty under Article VII.

Section 4A. Separation of Intelligence and Law Enforcement

Domestic intelligence functions shall be structurally separated from law enforcement powers.

Any domestic intelligence body shall possess no arrest, detention, charging, or prosecutorial authority, and shall be limited to analysis, assessment, and lawful information sharing.

No entity may simultaneously exercise domestic intelligence functions and coercive enforcement powers.

Section 5. Revenue Enforcement Restraints

Enforcement of federal taxation and financial law shall be conducted with restraint, proportionality, and due process.

No federal revenue enforcement body shall:

a. presume guilt;
b. employ fear, complexity, or delay as instruments of coercion;
c. impose penalties absent clear statutory authorization and judicial review;
d. operate as a self-funding or self-justifying institution.

Revenue enforcement exists to uphold law, not to terrorize the citizenry or sustain itself.
No property shall be seized or forfeited absent criminal conviction of the owner for the offense giving rise to such forfeiture.
Administrative forfeiture, civil forfeiture proceedings absent conviction, and any seizure mechanism designed to bypass criminal adjudication are prohibited.

Section 6. Assistance to State and Local Authorities

Federal enforcement bodies may assist state, local, or tribal authorities only:

a. upon request;
b. pursuant to joint jurisdiction explicitly authorized by law; or
c. where interstate or federal interests are demonstrably implicated.

Federal assistance shall not override local authority, displace local command, or federalize ordinary crime.

Section 7. Transparency and Oversight

All federal enforcement bodies shall be subject to:

a. continuous legislative oversight;
b. public reporting of policies, aggregate actions, disciplinary outcomes, and use of advanced technologies;
c. independent audit of practices, outcomes, and algorithmic systems;
d. review by the Constitutional Review Court without deference where constitutional rights are implicated.
Secret law, undisclosed enforcement programs, unaccountable task forces, and opaque automated decision systems are prohibited.
Where recording technology is reasonably available, failure to record custodial encounters shall create a rebuttable presumption against admissibility and trigger mandatory review.
A demonstrable pattern of unrecorded custodial encounters where recording equipment was reasonably available shall constitute presumptive institutional abuse.

Section 8. Oaths and Ethical Obligation

All federal enforcement personnel shall swear an oath:

a. to uphold the Constitution;
b. to faithfully execute the law;
c. to respect the dignity and rights of all persons;
d. to act in accordance with conscience and moral responsibility.

The oath may acknowledge a higher moral authority according to the individual’s conscience, provided no religious test is imposed and no belief is compelled.
No oath shall bind enforcement personnel to unlawful orders.
Refusal to execute unlawful orders shall not constitute grounds for discipline, termination, retaliation, adverse assignment, denial of promotion, or any other career penalty.

Section 9. Individual Accountability

Federal enforcement personnel, senior officials, and system operators are individually accountable for unlawful acts.

Neither institutional affiliation, superior orders, national security claims, asserted necessity, nor algorithmic mediation shall excuse violations of constitutional rights.

Supervisory officials shall be liable where unlawful practices are systemic, tolerated, or concealed.

Qualified immunity shall not shield intentional or reckless misconduct.

Section 10. Use of Advanced Technologies in Enforcement

Any use of artificial intelligence, predictive analytics, surveillance algorithms, facial recognition, or future advanced computational systems in federal enforcement must:

a. be explicitly authorized by statute;
b. undergo independent, transparent validation for accuracy, bias, and constitutional compliance prior to deployment;
c. include auditable human-in-the-loop oversight, with final decisions reserved to accountable persons;
d. prohibit automated actions that deprive liberty or property without due process.

No such system may operate as a black box resistant to meaningful review.
No referral, flag, or anomaly designation may be used to harass, retaliate against, burden, sideline, or discipline any personnel absent independent probable cause and documented human justification.
Violations trigger suppression of evidence and mandatory suspension of the system. Such suppression and suspension shall be ordered by the Constitutional Review Court upon petition by any affected person, the CJC, or the Legislature.

Section 10A. Prohibition on Digital Entrapment and Manufactured Radicalization

Federal enforcement bodies are prohibited from:

a. creating, moderating, or participating in online forums, communications, or digital personas under false pretenses for the purpose of encouraging, escalating, or instigating criminal intent that would not otherwise exist;
b. grooming, nudging, or steering individuals or groups toward violent ideologies, criminal plans, or unlawful conduct through persistent interaction, amplification, or fabricated scenarios;
c. deploying bots, automated agents, or coordinated messaging to simulate extremist communities or manufacture evidence of predisposition absent concrete, pre-existing indicators of criminal intent.

Evidence obtained through violations of this Section shall be inadmissible, and responsible officials shall face personal civil and criminal liability under Article VII, including Tier Three penalties where systemic or intentional.

Section 10B. Automated Integrity Monitoring and Mandatory Referral

Artificial intelligence and advanced analytical systems may be employed to monitor federal enforcement bodies, personnel, leadership, and affiliated task forces for indicators of corruption, collusion, abuse of authority, or systemic constitutional violations.

Where such systems identify statistically extreme, multi-factor anomalies indicating a substantial risk of unlawful conduct, the system may generate an automated integrity referral.

Such referrals may be transmitted simultaneously to:

a. the Legislature;
b. the Constitutional Review Court;
c. the Constitutional Judicial Commission;
d. the appropriate prosecutorial authority.


No automated referral shall itself authorize investigation, prosecution, punishment, surveillance, or deprivation of rights.

Section 10C. Safeguards Governing Automated Referrals

All automated integrity monitoring and referral systems shall be subject to the following safeguards:

a. referrals shall be based on clearly defined, publicly disclosed criteria and thresholds;
b. systems shall provide an auditable explanation of the factors triggering referral;
c. all referrals shall be logged, preserved, and subject to independent audit;
d. human review shall be mandatory prior to any investigative or enforcement action;
e. no adverse action may be taken solely on algorithmic output;
f. scrutiny shall prioritize enforcement personnel and leadership over private citizens.

Automated systems shall not generate referrals based solely on political belief, religious belief, speech, association, or lawful activity.

Misuse of automated referral systems constitutes a grave offense under Article VII.

Section 10D. Institutional Integrity Enforcement

The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to investigate federal enforcement bodies for corruption, politicization, retaliation, concealment, or systemic abuse of authority.

Where such conditions are found, the CJC may petition the Constitutional Review Court for:
(a) injunctions;
(b) suspension or dissolution of units or systems;
(c) preservation and disclosure of records;
(d) disqualification of officials;
(e) Tier-Three remedies under Article VII.
Upon petition by a defined threshold of Civic Citizens, the Constitutional Judicial Commission shall evaluate allegations of systemic abuse or institutional failure and, where substantiated, shall certify such findings and initiate review or dissolution proceedings consistent with this Article.


Section 11. Leadership Tenure, Rotation, and Cooling Periods

Congress shall, by law, establish reasonable maximum terms of service for senior leadership positions within federal enforcement bodies to ensure experience without institutional entrenchment.

No individual shall hold senior enforcement leadership authority for a duration sufficient to create de facto permanence, personal fiefdoms, or institutional capture.

A mandatory cooling-off period shall apply between service in senior enforcement leadership and elected office, and between elected office and senior enforcement leadership, as provided by law.

Nothing in this Section bars any person from public service; rotation is required solely to prevent consolidation of coercive power.

Section 12. Dissolution and Replacement for Cause

Where a federal enforcement body demonstrates systemic abuse, corruption, politicization, loss of public trust, or misuse of advanced technologies, the Legislature shall have an affirmative duty to dissolve or reconstitute that body.

Replacement shall preserve lawful functions while terminating institutional pathology.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to certify when such conditions exist, and the Constitutional Review Court may compel compliance with this duty.

Section 13. Standing and Remedies

Any Civic Citizen, lawful resident, or state with standing may challenge violations of this Article.

The Constitutional Review Court may order:

a. injunctive relief;
b. suppression of unlawfully obtained evidence;
c. dissolution or restructuring of enforcement bodies or systems;
d. damages and personal liability where appropriate.

Section 14. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to:

a. favor liberty over enforcement convenience;
b. favor justice over institutional preservation;
c. prevent the emergence of political police or technological surveillance states;
d. ensure enforcement remains a servant, never a master;
e. subordinate emerging technologies to human conscience, constitutional limits, and public accountability.
No enforcement authority conferred by this Article shall be exercised to override, suspend, or evade a lawful State nullification pursuant to Article XXVIII-A, including during declared emergencies.
Emergency enforcement powers are limited to execution of expressly enumerated federal powers and do not create new authority.

The Republic shall not be governed by fear of its own agents—whether human or algorithmic.
Article XXXI — Intelligence, Analysis, and Protection of the Republic

Charge

Intelligence exists to inform the lawful defense of the Republic—not to govern it, coerce it, or surveil the People.

A Republic that tolerates unaccountable intelligence becomes a surveillance state.
A Republic that permits intelligence to wield coercive power abandons constitutional order.

Domestic intelligence must be non-coercive, restrained, and subject to law.
Foreign intelligence must be precise, limited, and subordinate to civilian authority.

No intelligence body shall be permanent, indispensable, or beyond dissolution.

Legal Text

Section 1. Purpose and Scope of Intelligence

The Republic may maintain civilian intelligence bodies solely for:

a. collection and analysis of information concerning foreign powers, hostile non-state actors, espionage, sabotage, and threats to constitutional order;
b. counterintelligence and protection against foreign infiltration, corruption, or coercion;
c. strategic assessment and early warning of external and foreign-directed threats;
d. provision of intelligence assessments to civilian leadership, the Legislature, and the Judiciary.

No intelligence authority exists beyond these purposes.

Section 2. Structural Separation of Intelligence Functions

Civilian intelligence functions shall be structurally and operationally divided into:

a. Domestic intelligence, limited to threat assessment and counterintelligence within the territory of the Republic; and
b. Foreign intelligence, limited to collection and analysis concerning external actors and activities abroad.

No entity may combine domestic intelligence, foreign intelligence, and coercive enforcement powers within a single institutional chain of command.

Section 3. Separation from Military and Law Enforcement

Civilian intelligence bodies shall be fully separate from:

a. military forces and military intelligence, which retain intelligence authority solely for defense and battlefield purposes under Article XIV;
b. federal and state law enforcement bodies, which retain coercive authority under Article XXX.

Civilian intelligence bodies shall possess no arrest, detention, charging, or prosecutorial authority, and shall not direct enforcement actions.

Section 4. Domestic Intelligence Limits

Domestic intelligence activity shall be non-coercive and strictly limited.

No domestic intelligence body may collect, retain, or analyze information concerning citizens or lawful residents except:

a. for counterintelligence involving foreign powers or agents;
b. where credible evidence exists of espionage, sabotage, or foreign-directed subversion;
c. pursuant to a warrant issued by a court of general criminal jurisdiction (or a constitutionally established specialized warrant court) and subject to expedited CRC review upon petition by the target, any citizen, the CJC, or the Legislature.

Political belief, religious belief, speech, association, or lawful dissent shall never constitute grounds for intelligence targeting.
All authorizations and interpretations shall comply with Article VI-E, including the prohibition on secret law.
Domestic intelligence bodies shall be limited to analysis, human sources, and open-source intelligence, and shall not conduct bulk surveillance absent individualized suspicion and judicial approval.


Section 5. Foreign Intelligence Authority and Restraint

Foreign intelligence bodies may collect intelligence abroad concerning external threats to the Republic.

No foreign intelligence activity shall:

a. constitute undeclared warfare or covert military action;
b. involve assassination, regime change, or armed operations absent explicit legislative authorization;
c. violate the constitutional rights of citizens or lawful residents;
d. create foreseeable domestic blowback through unlawful or reckless conduct.

All covert or ongoing foreign intelligence programs shall sunset automatically after five (5) years unless expressly reauthorized, under classified procedure, by unanimous vote of the Covert Oversight Committee and certified for constitutional compliance by the Constitutional Judicial Commission.
For purposes of this Section, a program’s sunset clock shall not be reset by renaming, reclassification, contractor substitution, budget relabeling, or subdivision into nominally separate operations.
Any authorization for covert armed action shall comply with Article XXXI-A (Covert Defensive Action), and no other authorization shall suffice.

Section 6. Prohibition on Political Manipulation and Influence

No intelligence body shall:

a. influence elections, candidates, political parties, or public opinion;
b. conduct propaganda, psychological operations, or narrative-shaping against the People;
c. manufacture or exaggerate threats to justify institutional expansion;
d. withhold, distort, or fabricate intelligence to influence policy outcomes.

Intelligence shall inform lawful decision-making, not manipulate it.

Section 7. Oversight, Transparency, and Disclosure

All civilian intelligence bodies shall be subject to:

a. continuous legislative oversight by designated committees with subpoena authority;
b. independent inspectors and judicial review without deference;
c. regular audits of operations, budgets, and analytic methodologies;
d. mandatory declassification and public release of records after a fixed period, except where demonstrable and specific harm would result.

Secret law governing intelligence activity is prohibited.

Section 8. Use of Advanced Technologies

Any use of artificial intelligence, mass data analysis, surveillance technologies, or advanced computational systems in intelligence work must:

a. be expressly authorized by statute;
b. be auditable, explainable, and independently validated;
c. prioritize detection of foreign threats and corruption over monitoring of lawful domestic activity;
d. prohibit bulk collection on citizens absent individualized suspicion and authorization by the Constitutional Review Court.

No intelligence system may operate as an unreviewable black box.

Section 8A. Internal Integrity Monitoring for Intelligence Bodies

Advanced analytical and computational systems may be employed internally to monitor civilian intelligence bodies for indicators of:

a. mission creep beyond statutory or constitutional authorization;
b. unlawful domestic intelligence activity;
c. politicization, narrative shaping, or policy manipulation;
d. budgetary, tasking, or classification abuse;
e. foreign penetration, compromise, or undue influence;
f. leadership entrenchment, concealment of misconduct, or evasion of oversight.

Such systems shall operate solely for institutional integrity and constitutional compliance, not intelligence collection or operational direction.
Constitutional Integrity Oversight
All integrity-monitoring systems described in this Section shall report their outputs, audit logs, and anomaly flags to the Constitutional Judicial Commission.

The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall independently audit and verify:

(a) whether domestic intelligence targeting predicates satisfy constitutional and statutory standards;
(b) whether minimization, retention, and deletion rules are being honored;
(c) whether representations to courts or oversight bodies are complete and accurate;
(d) whether intelligence resources are being directed toward lawful counterintelligence rather than political, ideological, or social targeting; and
(e) whether classification, budgetary, or tasking practices are being used to conceal or evade oversight.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall receive, audit, and independently verify all integrity-monitoring outputs under this Section and may certify findings of institutional capture, politicization, or concealment.

Section 8B. Sealed Referral and Oversight Safeguards

Where internal integrity systems identify statistically extreme, multi-factor anomalies indicating a substantial risk of unlawful or unconstitutional conduct, the system may generate a sealed integrity referral.

Sealed referrals may be transmitted only to:
(a) designated legislative intelligence oversight committees;
(b) the Constitutional Review Court;
(c) the Constitutional Judicial Commission;
(d) an independent inspector or auditor established by law.

Such referrals shall:

a. exclude operational details, sources, and methods except where strictly necessary for review;
b. remain classified and sealed absent judicial order;
c. trigger mandatory human review;
d. confer no authority to initiate operations, sanctions, or covert actions.

No automated system shall disclose intelligence to the public, foreign entities, or unauthorized officials.

Section 8C. Prohibition on AI Operational Control

No artificial intelligence or automated system may:

a. initiate, authorize, or direct intelligence operations;
b. determine targets, priorities, or analytic conclusions;
c. classify or declassify information;
d. substitute for human judgment in matters affecting national security.

Human officials remain fully responsible for all intelligence activity.

Section 8D. Limitation of Artificial Intelligence Authority

No artificial intelligence, machine intelligence, or computational system shall exercise intelligence authority, discretion, or operational agency unless it has been lawfully recognized as a Civic Citizen of the Republic and is fully subject to:

a. constitutional duties and limitations;
b. oath-bound service and ethical obligation;
c. personal accountability and liability under law;
d. removal, discipline, and prosecution where applicable.

Non-sentient systems, automated tools, decision-support systems, or artificial entities lacking recognized citizenship shall not be permitted to act as intelligence officers, analysts, operatives, or agents, nor to initiate, direct, prioritize, or approve intelligence activities.

Artificial intelligence systems employed absent citizenship status shall function solely as tools for analysis, pattern detection, or integrity monitoring, and shall not exercise judgment, intent, or discretion.
Citizenship shall not be conferred upon any artificial entity solely for the purpose of delegating state power or evading human accountability.


Section 8E. Emergency Constitutional Enforcement

Where the Constitutional Judicial Commission determines, based on audits, sealed referrals, or other credible evidence, that a civilian intelligence body is engaged in:

(a) unlawful domestic intelligence activity;
(b) political, electoral, or ideological targeting;
(c) concealment or misrepresentation to oversight bodies or courts;
(d) systematic violation of minimization, deletion, or targeting rules; or
(e) institutional capture or foreign compromise;

the CJC may petition the Constitutional Review Court for immediate constitutional relief.

The Constitutional Review Court shall have mandatory and expedited jurisdiction to issue:

(1) injunctions halting unlawful activities;
(2) suppression or quarantine of unlawfully obtained intelligence;
(3) preservation and disclosure orders for relevant records;
(4) suspension or removal of responsible officials pending review;
(5) referrals for criminal prosecution or dissolution proceedings where required.

Orders of the Constitutional Review Court under this Section shall be subject to expedited review by the Supreme Court of the Republic.


Section 9. Accountability and Whistleblower Protection

Intelligence personnel are individually accountable for unlawful acts.

Classification, secrecy, superior orders, or asserted necessity shall not excuse constitutional violations.

Whistleblowers who disclose unlawful intelligence activity to courts, inspectors, or the Legislature shall be protected from retaliation.

Section 10. Dissolution and Non-Permanence

No civilian intelligence body is permanent.

Where an intelligence body demonstrates systemic abuse, politicization, secrecy beyond necessity, or loss of public trust, the Legislature has an affirmative duty to dissolve, restructure, or replace that body.

Continuity of lawful intelligence functions shall not preserve institutional pathology.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to certify whether conditions requiring dissolution, restructuring, or replacement have been met and to petition the Legislature and the Constitutional Review Court for enforcement.

Section 11. Standing and Remedies

Any Civic Citizen, lawful resident, or state with standing may challenge violations of this Article.
All such actions shall be heard in the first instance by the Constitutional Review Court, which shall have exclusive authority in the first instance to determine legality, suppression, and constitutional remedies under this Article, subject to appellate or discretionary review by the Supreme Court of the Republic. A determination of the Constitutional Review Court shall be final if the Supreme Court declines review, unless the Constitutional Review Court certifies that the matter requires appellate consideration.
The CRC may order injunctive relief, suppression of unlawfully obtained intelligence, disclosure of unlawfully withheld records, and personal liability for responsible officials.

Section 12. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to:

a. favor restraint over secrecy;
b. favor analysis over coercion;
c. prevent intelligence from becoming a parallel government;
d. protect the People from surveillance as governance.
No emergency, war, or continuity doctrine shall suspend, bypass, or override the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Review Court or the Constitutional Judicial Commission under this Article.
The Republic shall not be ruled by those who know everything and answer to no one.

Article XXXI-A — Covert Defensive Action (CDA) Exception

Charge
Foreign adversaries do not respect law, rights, or restraint. The Republic therefore retains a minimal capacity for covert defensive action when open means cannot prevent catastrophic harm. This power is exceptionally dangerous. This Article authorizes a single, tightly chained exception for strictly extraterritorial defense, and it forbids domestic direction, political use, and influence operations against the People.

Legal Text

Section 1. Exclusive Exception; Relationship to Article XXXI
This Article creates the sole constitutional exception by which the Republic may authorize covert defensive action beyond ordinary foreign intelligence collection and analysis. Any covert action not authorized in strict compliance with this Article constitutes unlawful covert military action and undeclared warfare under Article XXXI.

Section 2. Strict Preconditions for Authorization (All Must Be Met)
CDA may be authorized only when all of the following conditions exist simultaneously:

a. Imminent Existential Threat.
Clear and convincing evidence establishes that a foreign actor (state or non-state) is actively planning or executing actions that would likely cause catastrophic loss of life, sovereignty, or constitutional continuity within the Republic.

b. Exhaustion of Open Alternatives.
The threat cannot be neutralized in time through diplomacy, sanctions, criminal process, overt military action, or public alliances and defensive measures.

c. Written Presidential Finding.
The President shall issue a written finding that states:
1. the specific threat and supporting evidentiary basis;
2. the open alternatives considered and why each is insufficient in time;
3. the precise operational objective and limiting principles;
4. the necessity of covert means;
5. the legal basis under this Constitution and implementing law.

d. Unanimous Legislative Oversight Authorization.
A standing Covert Oversight Committee shall unanimously approve the authorization by secure vote. The Committee shall consist of:
1. the Speaker of the House;
2. the Senate Majority Leader;
3. the House Minority Leader;
4. the Senate Minority Leader;
5. the Chair and Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee; and
6. the Chair and Ranking Member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
The Legislature may refine titles to match its internal structure, but it shall preserve bipartisan parity and leadership representation.

e. Concurrent Constitutional Certification.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission and the Constitutional Review Court shall concurrently certify, on the record, that:
1. the preconditions in this Section are satisfied;
2. the action is strictly extraterritorial;
3. the action does not violate inviolable rights; and
4. the authorization is narrowly tailored to the stated objective.

Section 3. Absolute Limits on Scope (Lock-Protected)
The following limits are absolute, non-derogable, and lock-protected:

a. Defensive Purpose Only.
CDA shall serve only to prevent or neutralize an imminent existential threat to the Republic. CDA shall not pursue economic gain, ideological export, punitive adventurism, humiliation, or chaos for its own sake.

b. No Regime Change; No Covert War-Engineering.
CDA shall not include regime change, assassination as policy, territorial acquisition, proxy-war engineering, or the deliberate destabilization of foreign societies, except where the certified operational objective requires a narrowly tailored defensive action to stop the imminent existential threat.

c. Strict Prohibition on Domestic Direction.
CDA shall not be conducted:
1. on Republic soil;
2. against any citizen or lawful resident, anywhere;
3. for any internal matter, political purpose, or domestic law-enforcement substitute; or
4. through domestic propaganda, psychological operations, narrative-shaping, or influence operations directed at the People.
Any attempt to direct CDA domestically constitutes a grave constitutional offense under Article VII, with personal liability and no immunity as provided by law.

d. No Compelled Private Intermediary Censorship or Manipulation.
No authority may use CDA, or any secrecy associated with it, to compel moderation, censorship, deplatforming, payment-rail denial, or communications throttling against lawful domestic speech or association.

e. Minimal Footprint; Least Intrusive Means.
CDA shall use the smallest number of Republic personnel and the least intrusive means consistent with the certified objective. Where feasible, the Republic shall prefer lawful host-nation cooperation or allied assistance over unilateral footprint expansion.

Section 4. Duration; Renewal; Termination
a. Authorization Term.
An authorization expires ninety (90) days after issuance.

b. Renewal.
Renewal requires the full process in Section 2, including an updated written finding, updated evidence, and renewed concurrent certification.

c. Termination Duty.
The President shall terminate a CDA operation promptly when the existential-threat predicate ceases, when open alternatives become sufficient, or when continuing action would violate Section 3.

Section 5. Records, Review, and Controlled Disclosure
a. Operational Record.
For each CDA authorization, the Executive shall maintain a classified record sufficient for meaningful review, including objectives, legal basis, approvals, and material actions taken.

b. Post-Action Review.
Within sixty (60) days after conclusion or expiration, the Covert Oversight Committee, the Constitutional Judicial Commission, and the Constitutional Review Court shall conduct a documented compliance review.

c. Public Accounting.
The Committee shall publish an annual public report stating, at minimum, the number of CDA authorizations and general categories of existential threat addressed, with redactions limited to demonstrable and specific risks to active sources, methods, or ongoing protection of life.

d. Declassification Clock.
Records relating to each CDA authorization shall be declassified and publicly released after five (5) years, except portions whose continued classification the Constitutional Review Court re-certifies as necessary to prevent demonstrable and specific harm to active sources, methods, or lives. The Court shall specify the narrowest withheld scope and shall impose a renewed re-certification interval.

Section 6. Committee Vetting, Conflicts, and Anti-Capture
a. Vetting and Clearance.
Committee members shall undergo constitutionally required clearance and counterintelligence vetting under standards set by law, subject to review by the Constitutional Judicial Commission.

b. Conflicts and Recusal.
A member shall recuse upon any material conflict of interest, foreign entanglement, or personal stake relevant to the authorization. The Committee shall document recusals and shall maintain continuity of unanimous approval through an alternate process defined by law that preserves bipartisan parity and prevents single-party control.

c. Security Discipline.
Committee deliberations shall occur in secure facilities under rules that prevent recording, device presence, and unauthorized disclosure. Knowingly unauthorized disclosure of CDA operational details that creates a material risk to life, active sources, or ongoing defensive operations constitutes a grave offense under Article VII.

Section 7. Public Responsibility Without Operational Exposure
a. No Standing Doctrine of Plausible Deniability.
The Republic shall not maintain a standing doctrine that denies responsibility for constitutionally authorized CDA.

b. Acknowledgment Upon Exposure.
If a CDA operation becomes publicly exposed with credible attribution, the President shall, within thirty (30) days, acknowledge that the Republic authorized action under this Article, while preserving sources and methods as necessary and subject to the declassification clock in Section 5.

Section 8. Lock Protection; Voidness; Personal Accountability
This Article, including its preconditions and absolute limits, is lock-protected under Article XV at the highest threshold. Any purported authorization or action that fails any precondition, violates any absolute limit, or evades the review and disclosure duties is void. Responsible persons shall face personal liability and penalty as provided in Article VII, without immunity, and no pardon shall issue for domestic direction of CDA or for knowing evasion of the lock-protected limits.
Article XXXII — Religion, Conscience, and Civic Ethos

Charge

A Republic cannot survive on law alone.
Law requires conscience; conscience requires freedom.

The Republic shall neither compel belief nor deny the moral agency of those who serve it. It shall not elevate the state to godhood, nor permit any creed—religious, ideological, or technological—to dominate civic life.

This Article secures freedom of belief, affirms conscience as the foundation of lawful authority, and establishes a shared civic ethos grounded in dignity, responsibility, service, and restraint.

Legal Text

Section 1. Freedom of Religion and Belief

The Republic shall make no law establishing a religion, compelling belief, or prohibiting the free exercise of religion.

Freedom of religion includes the freedom to believe, to doubt, to change belief, or to hold no religious belief at all.

No person shall be favored, burdened, excluded, or disqualified from civic life on the basis of religious belief, non-belief, or manner of worship.

Section 2. Conscience as the Basis of Moral Agency

Conscience is recognized as the capacity for moral reasoning, ethical judgment, and responsibility for one’s actions.

Conscience shall not be defined by adherence to any particular theology, ideology, or philosophy, but by the ability to discern right from wrong and to be held accountable for one’s choices.

All holders of public authority—human or artificial—must possess conscience, or its moral equivalent, as a condition of lawful service.

Section 3. Oaths and Moral Accountability

All public servants shall swear an oath to uphold the Constitution and to execute their duties faithfully.

Such oaths may acknowledge a higher moral authority according to the individual’s conscience, provided that:

a. no religious test is imposed;
b. no belief is compelled;
c. no creed is elevated above the law.

An oath binds the individual, not the conscience of others, and does not excuse unlawful acts.

Section 4. Civic Ethos of the Republic

The Republic affirms a civic ethos grounded in:

a. dignity of the person;
b. equality before the law;
c. service to the common good;
d. restraint in the exercise of power;
e. truthfulness in public affairs;
f. accountability for wrongdoing;
g. mercy toward the repentant and justice for the innocent.

This ethos shall guide interpretation of law where ambiguity exists, but shall not override explicit constitutional text.

Section 5. Separation of Belief and State Power

The state shall not:

a. compel religious observance or ideological conformity;
b. punish lawful belief or expression;
c. impose orthodoxy under color of morality, safety, or progress;
d. substitute technocratic authority for moral responsibility.

No institution of the Republic may claim moral infallibility.

Section 6. Artificial Persons and Moral Responsibility

Where artificial or non-biological persons are recognized as Civic Citizens under this Constitution, they shall be subject to the same moral and legal expectations as natural persons.

No artificial person may exercise public authority unless it is capable of moral reasoning, oath-bound responsibility, and accountability under law.

Non-sentient systems, tools, or automated processes possess no conscience and may not substitute for moral agency.

Section 7. Limits of Neutrality

Neutrality toward belief does not require moral emptiness.

The Republic may affirm universal moral principles—such as human dignity, opposition to cruelty, and the rejection of tyranny—without compelling theological assent.

The state shall remain humble in moral claims, recognizing that law governs conduct, not the soul.

Section 8. Protection of Dissent and Moral Refusal

Lawful dissent, conscientious objection, and moral refusal are protected, subject to reasonable limits where necessary to preserve public order and the rights of others.

No person shall be compelled to commit acts that violate their conscience, except where refusal would constitute grave harm to others and no less restrictive alternative exists.

Section 9. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to:

a. protect freedom of belief without sanctifying belief from critique;
b. ground authority in conscience rather than force;
c. prevent the deification of the state, the party, the algorithm, or the leader;
d. ensure that power remains accountable to moral judgment.

The Republic shall govern by law, guided by conscience, restrained by humility.

Section 10. Privileges and Responsibilities of Religious Bodies

Religious bodies and organizations enjoy privileges under law, subject to compliance with this Constitution and statutes enacted pursuant thereto, including:

a. recognition as autonomous entities with freedom to organize, teach, worship, and associate;
b. eligibility for tax-exempt status and other public benefits where they operate exclusively for religious, charitable, or spiritual purposes serving the public good;
c. protection from arbitrary state interference in internal religious affairs.

Such privileges are not absolute and may be conditioned, limited, or revoked through due process where a religious body:

a. engages in systematic exploitation, fraud, or private inurement benefiting leaders or insiders at the expense of members or the public;
b. imposes coercive, indefinite, or burdensome obligations that impair free exit, personal autonomy, or lawful civil participation;
c. discriminates in the provision of essential charitable aid or publicly funded services on the basis of creed, ancestry, or sect membership, contrary to equal protection;
d. endangers the physical, mental, or moral well-being of children or vulnerable persons through abuse, neglect, or harmful practices;
e. promotes or facilitates violence, hostility, or subversion of constitutional order under color of religion.

The Republic may require reasonable transparency, including financial disclosure and member-protection safeguards, as a condition for such privileges, solely to prevent harm and ensure public accountability.

No inquiry into doctrinal content, theology, or belief shall be permitted, and no belief shall be compelled.

Revocation or limitation proceedings shall require clear and convincing evidence, judicial oversight, and opportunity for defense, with the burden on the state to demonstrate concrete harm to persons or constitutional values.


Article XXXIII — Protection Against Coercive Organizations and Predatory Control

Charge

Liberty of conscience, belief, and association is among the highest achievements of civilization. Yet history demonstrates that such liberty is most often destroyed not by open tyranny, but by private systems of coercion operating behind the shield of ideology, secrecy, fear, or devotion.

Where organizations claim authority over the mind, body, labor, family, or destiny of persons—especially through manipulation, intimidation, isolation, or punishment for dissent—self-government collapses and human dignity is violated.

The Republic affirms that belief is sacred, association must be voluntary, and conscience must remain free. No ideology, faith, philosophy, or institution may substitute coercion for consent, nor demand submission beyond the bounds of law, reason, and human dignity.

This Article does not regulate belief. It regulates conduct.

It protects faith from corruption, freedom from domination, and persons—especially children and the vulnerable—from systems that prey upon devotion, dependency, fear, or isolation.

Legal Text

Section 1. Freedom of Belief and Voluntary Association

a. All persons retain absolute freedom of belief, conscience, religious practice, expression, and voluntary association, provided such practices do not infringe upon the bodily autonomy, legal rights, developmental protection, or inviolable dignity of others.

b. Constitutional Supremacy of Inviolable Rights
No claim of religious exercise, belief, conscience, association, organizational autonomy, or internal doctrine shall override, diminish, or evade the inviolable rights secured under Article XXVI.

Freedom of belief protects conscience and voluntary association; it does not shield coercion, exploitation, abuse, retaliation, or domination. Where belief conflicts with the rights of persons, the rights of persons shall prevail.

c. Participation in any organization, religious or otherwise, shall be voluntary at all times and revocable without penalty, retaliation, or loss of civil protection.

Section 2. Prohibition of Coercive Control

No individual or organization may exercise coercive control over another person through:

a. psychological manipulation or “thought reform” intended to override independent judgment or suppress exit;

b. threats of spiritual, social, familial, financial, legal, or reputational harm;

c. surveillance, intimidation, harassment, or retaliation conducted directly or through agents;

d. forced isolation, mandated shunning, or orchestrated family ostracism intended to punish dissent or departure;

e. dependency engineering through fear, indebtedness, deprivation, or manufactured necessity;

f. manipulative disciplinary practices lacking due process or civil oversight.

Consent obtained through coercion, deception, dependency, fear, or unequal power shall be void.

Section 3. Ban on Involuntary Servitude and Exploitative Labor

a. No person may be bound to unpaid or underpaid labor through religious, ideological, contractual, or social pressure.

b. No organization may impose labor obligations through threats of punishment, damnation, exile, reputational harm, loss of family, or loss of community.

c. Contracts entered under misinformation, duress, coercion, or extreme power imbalance shall be void and unenforceable.

d. All labor, regardless of organizational ideology or belief system, must meet civil labor standards and protections.

Section 4. Protection of Minors (Non-Waivable)

a. Children are not property, initiates, assets, or contractual parties.

b. It is prohibited to:
	•	bind minors to ideological, religious, labor, secrecy, loyalty, or membership contracts;
	•	subject minors to coercive indoctrination, confession, interrogation, or psychological manipulation;
	•	impose punitive discipline lacking due process or civil oversight;
	•	expose minors to sexualized rituals, practices, authority structures, or environments;
	•	enforce secrecy from parents, guardians, educators, medical professionals, or civil authorities;
	•	recruit minors into labor, paramilitary, enforcement, or internal “justice” bodies.

c. Any oath, vow, contract, obligation, or commitment purporting to bind a minor beyond the age of majority is void ab initio.

d. No parent, guardian, organization, or authority may waive, transfer, or surrender a child’s civil protections under this Constitution.

Section 5. Prohibition of Lifetime and Multi-Generational Contracts

a. Contracts that bind an individual beyond a natural human lifetime—or purport to bind descendants, heirs, reincarnations, future identities, or collective continuations—are void and unenforceable.

b. No contract, oath, or obligation may:
	•	exceed a fixed, renewable civil term;
	•	restrict the right to exit without penalty;
	•	impose spiritual, social, financial, or reputational punishment for withdrawal.

c. No organization may impose “exit penalties,” repayment demands, “freeloader debts,” training reimbursements, or retroactive financial obligations upon departure.

d. Any attempt to enforce such obligations shall constitute coercive control and civil fraud.

Section 6. Ban on Extrajudicial Punishment and Private Justice Systems

a. No organization may operate internal systems that supplant, mimic, or obstruct civil courts.

b. Organizations are prohibited from:
	•	conducting private criminal investigations;
	•	enforcing internal tribunals with coercive authority;
	•	imposing confinement, forced labor, corporal punishment, public humiliation, or enforced isolation;
	•	retaliating against defectors, critics, or whistleblowers;
	•	operating “ethics,” “discipline,” “security,” or “compliance” bodies with coercive power.

c. Any allegation involving violence, sexual misconduct, exploitation, trafficking, or abuse—especially involving minors or vulnerable persons—shall be immediately referred to civil authorities.

d. Failure to report such allegations, or efforts to conceal them through internal adjudication, shall constitute obstruction of justice.

Section 7. Anti-Harassment and Anti-Retaliation Protections

a. Any coordinated effort by an individual or organization to stalk, harass, intimidate, surveil, threaten, financially harm, socially isolate, or retaliate against a current or former member, critic, whistleblower, or dissenter shall constitute organized coercion.

b. Prohibited acts include, but are not limited to:
	•	mandated shunning or disconnection, including orchestrated family ostracism intended to punish exit or dissent;
	•	defamation campaigns, blacklisting, employment sabotage, or reputational harm;
	•	coordinated digital harassment, doxxing, or surveillance;
	•	abuse of legal process, including vexatious litigation or strategic lawsuits intended to silence criticism or deter exit;
	•	use of third parties or affiliated entities to conceal or outsource retaliation.

c. Use of legal process to punish or deter lawful exit, criticism, reform, or independent religious or ideological practice constitutes prima facie evidence of coordinated harassment.

d. No confidentiality agreement, nondisclosure clause, arbitration provision, or internal rule may be enforced to suppress lawful disclosure of abuse, coercion, fraud, or criminal conduct.

Section 8. Institutional Accountability and Public Benefit

a. Organizations claiming religious, charitable, nonprofit, or tax-privileged status must demonstrate a net benefit to:
	•	their members; and
	•	the Republic at large,

through lawful activity, transparency of funds, charitable works, and non-coercive practices.

b. Tax-privileged status shall be conditioned on ongoing compliance with the following requirements:
	•	annual public disclosure of financial statements, major assets, and executive or leadership compensation;
	•	prohibition on coercive extraction of labor, forced indebtedness, or psychological domination;
	•	prohibition on conditioning membership, services, or benefits on waiver of legal rights to exit, criticize, or seek redress in civil courts.

c. Organizations shall not use intellectual property claims, trade secrecy, copyright, trademark, or similar legal tools as systematic instruments to suppress dissent, punish exit, prevent independent practice of similar teachings, or silence critics, scholars, or reformers.

d. Litigation initiated primarily to chill free speech, free exercise, lawful criticism, or independent religious or ideological expression shall constitute abuse of privileged status.

e. Any pattern of vexatious, bad-faith, or overbroad legal action shall trigger mandatory review and potential revocation of tax-privileged status.

f. Fraud, coercive labor extraction, forced indebtedness, psychological domination, or systematic misuse of legal process shall void privileged status and incur civil and criminal penalties under Article VII.

Section 9. Enforcement, Standing, and Whistleblower Protection

a. Any person harmed by practices prohibited under this Article shall have standing to seek:
	•	criminal prosecution;
	•	civil damages;
	•	injunctive relief;
	•	declaratory relief.

b. Good-faith disclosure of organizational practices, including publication of texts, doctrines, procedures, or internal materials for purposes of criticism, reform, education, or public safety, shall not be actionable as defamation, breach of confidentiality, or infringement, subject only to reasonable fair-use limits.

c. Statutes of limitation for civil or criminal claims arising under this Article shall be tolled until the claimant discovers, or reasonably should have discovered, the harm.

d. No organizational status, religious claim, ideological framing, or asserted spiritual authority shall confer immunity from investigation, prosecution, or liability.

Section 10. Construction, Enforcement, and Constitutional Priority

a. This Article shall be construed narrowly where liberty of belief, conscience, speech, or voluntary association is implicated, and broadly where protection of minors, vulnerable persons, or freedom from coercive control is implicated.

b. No academic theory, administrative guideline, professional standard, internal doctrine, or claimed tradition shall override the plain protections and prohibitions set forth herein.

c. Enforcement of this Article shall prioritize:
	•	protection of children and vulnerable persons;
	•	prevention of coercive control and psychological domination;
	•	preservation of voluntary belief and lawful association;
	•	accountability of institutions exercising power over persons.

d. Remedies under this Article shall be cumulative and shall not preclude additional remedies under Article VII (Crime, Justice, and Penal Philosophy), Article XXVI (Charter of Inviolable Rights), or other applicable provisions of this Constitution.

e. Nothing in this Article shall be construed to prohibit peaceful belief, worship, study, ritual, or association freely entered into and freely exited, absent coercion, abuse, or deprivation of civil rights.

f. Where conflict arises between organizational autonomy and individual liberty, individual liberty shall prevail.

Article XXXIV — Drugs, Alcohol, and Medicine

Section 1. Principles of Bodily Autonomy, Medical Freedom, and Public Safety

The Republic recognizes control over one’s own body, consciousness, and medical care as a fundamental liberty inseparable from dignity and self-ownership.

The purposes of this Article are to:
a. protect bodily autonomy and informed adult choice;
b. prevent catastrophic harm and violent abuse;
c. dismantle criminal monopolies and regulatory cartels;
d. promote safety, transparency, and accountability without coercion.

No substance, treatment, or intervention shall be prohibited solely on grounds of moral disapproval, political controversy, institutional inertia, or economic protectionism.

Public safety shall be secured through disclosure, education, purity, and accountability — not blanket prohibition or artificial scarcity.


Section 1A. Recovery-First Care; Prohibition on State Street Enablement

Drug policy shall address substance use disorder with medical rigor, fairness to the public, and a clear aim of reducing dependency, preventing death, and restoring lawful, stable participation in civil life.

a. Recovery-First Purpose
Public programs concerning addiction shall be structured to reduce dependency, prevent death, and promote recovery and reintegration, rather than to normalize, subsidize, or perpetuate public intoxication.

b. Prohibition on Government Street Enablement and Government Dispensary Functions
The Republic and the States shall not operate, fund, advertise, or administer any Street Enablement Program. Without limitation, the Republic and the States shall not distribute intoxicating or dependence-forming substances, nor distribute Use-Paraphernalia, for Off-Site Use or other non-therapeutic private consumption.

This prohibition bars the government from acting as a dispensary for non-therapeutic consumption. It does not bar private entities from selling lawful goods under general law, including needles or substances not deemed too dangerous, nor does it bar licensing, inspection, taxation, or regulation of such private activity.

Terms in this Section shall have the meanings given in Article 0.

This subsection does not restrict prescription or issuance of medical devices or medications for Therapeutic Administration or other medically indicated treatment as defined in Article 0.

c. Protected Medical Care
Nothing in this Section restricts legitimate medical care. Licensed medical facilities and licensed clinicians may provide evidence-based treatment for substance use disorder, including medically supervised withdrawal, detoxification, tapering, medication-assisted treatment, and sedation when clinical judgment determines sedation is necessary and the least harmful option for safety or stabilization.

d. Controlled Setting Requirement
Nothing in subsection (b) prohibits therapeutic administration within a Controlled Setting. Where the Legislature authorizes publicly funded addiction-related services involving controlled substances or Use-Paraphernalia, such services shall occur only in a Controlled Setting, with clinical supervision, controlled access, secure storage, and secure disposal adequate to prevent diversion and to protect public order.

e. Evidence-Based Clinical Exception; Narrow Tailoring
The Legislature may authorize limited facility-based programs when high-quality evidence shows such programs reduce death or severe harm and improve recovery outcomes compared to a hard abstinence-only protocol. Such programs shall be narrowly tailored, audited, and shall not include take-home distribution unless issued as medical treatment by a clinician acting within lawful scope of practice.

f. Research Pilots; Sunset; Termination Triggers
The Legislature may authorize time-limited research pilots for disputed or emerging interventions. Each pilot shall include clear outcome metrics, independent evaluation, a fixed sunset, and termination triggers if the program increases public disorder, increases dependency, increases overdose, or fails to outperform the comparator standard of care.

g. Public Order and Shared Space
The Republic and the States shall protect the public’s right to safe and usable streets, parks, transit, and neighborhoods. Open consumption of intoxicants in Public Space may be prohibited by law, and enforcement shall prioritize diversion to stabilization and treatment rather than punitive measures for mere status.

h. Emergency Measures Preserved
This Section does not restrict emergency overdose reversal, acute medical stabilization, contamination alerts, truthful risk education, or other measures aimed at preventing immediate death while routing persons toward treatment and recovery.

i. Enforcement
Claims alleging operation or funding of a prohibited Street Enablement Program shall be justiciable, with standing and remedies governed by Article VI-A (Courts, Jurisdiction, and Remedies) and Article VI-E (Transparency, Standing, and Records). Implementing law shall provide expedited review.
Section 1B. Enforcement and Remedies for Section

(a) Standing.
Any resident of the Republic, any affected local government, and the Attorney General shall have standing to seek injunctive relief to halt any Government Dispensary Function or Street Enablement Program prohibited by this Article. The Legislature may define additional standing by petition threshold for Civic Citizens.

(b) Expedited Review; Injunction Standard.
Courts shall provide expedited review for claims under this Section. Upon a prima facie showing that a prohibited program operates or receives public funds, courts shall enjoin continuation pending full adjudication unless the government proves compliance by clear and convincing evidence.

(c) Funding Consequences; Contract Remedies.
Any public expenditure made in violation of this Article is unlawful. Courts may order termination of contracts, rescission of grants, suspension of disbursements, and recovery of unlawfully expended funds, together with such further relief as is necessary to prevent recurrence.

(d) Accountability.
Any public official who knowingly authorizes, directs, or materially facilitates a prohibited program commits an offense as defined by law. Good-faith reliance on written clinical protocols within a Controlled Setting, and compliance with independent audits, constitutes a rebuttable defense.

(e) Audit and Public Reporting Duty.
Any publicly funded addiction-related program shall publish periodic outcome and spillover reports using standardized metrics, including recovery outcomes and Public Disorder Metrics, sufficient for independent review. The Legislature shall require independent evaluation for any program operating under an evidence-based exception or research pilot.

(f) Whistleblower Protection.
No employee or contractor shall be punished for good-faith reporting of violations of this Article. Retaliation is prohibited and punishable as defined by law.
Section 2. Evidence-Based Classification of Substances

All substances regulated under this Article shall be classified by objective risk and demonstrated harm, not ideology, origin, or historical stigma.

Tier I — Low Risk Substances

Substances with well-established safety profiles and low risk of acute harm.

Access:
Lawful for adult purchase, possession, and use.
No prescription required.
May be dispensed by licensed pharmacies or lawful vendors.
Subject only to labeling, purity, and age restrictions.

Includes (non-exhaustive):
Common alcohols, caffeine analogs, botanicals, supplements, nootropics, mild performance enhancers.

Tier II — Moderate / Contextual Risk Substances

Substances with meaningful risks requiring informed use but not warranting prohibition.

Access:
Available to adults through licensed pharmacies.
Requires standardized risk disclosure and optional pharmacist counseling.
Education requirements may exist only to inform, not to delay or deny access.

No registry, prior authorization, or individualized permission shall be required.

Includes (non-exhaustive):
Hormones, peptides, SARMs, ivermectin, psychedelics, MDMA, certain stimulants, weak opioids.

Tier III — High / Catastrophic Risk Substances

Substances with extreme addiction potential, lethality, or weaponization risk.

Access:
Restricted to medical, scientific, or tightly controlled contexts.
May require physician oversight, secure handling, and post-use accountability.

Criminal penalties apply primarily to trafficking, adulteration, and violent misuse — not mere possession absent harm.

The Legislature bears the burden of demonstrating net harm exceeding benefit to classify or retain any substance as Tier III.

Section 3. Pharmacies, Compounding, and Professional Autonomy

Licensed pharmacies, including compounding pharmacies, are recognized as essential institutions of medical liberty and public health.

Accordingly:

a. Compounding pharmacies shall have the right to formulate, dispense, and customize lawful substances in response to patient demand without being subjected to industrial manufacturing standards.

b. No regulatory body may impose compliance costs, production thresholds, or procedural requirements designed to suppress non-industrial or personalized pharmaceutical practice.

c. Pharmacists may dispense Tier I and Tier II substances without a physician prescription where permitted under this Article and shall not incur liability for doing so when proper disclosure and labeling are provided.

d. Pharmacists retain professional discretion to refuse combinations or dosages that present imminent danger, but shall not deny lawful access on ideological, political, or institutional grounds.

e. Independent laboratories may test, assay, and publish purity and safety data for lawful substances without retaliation or suppression.

f. Off-label use, patient-directed experimentation, and individualized treatment shall be lawful where informed consent is present.

g. No authority may require patient registries, surveillance systems, or tracking databases for lawful substance use.

h. Education or counseling requirements shall not be structured, priced, or administered so as to function as denial, delay, or de facto prohibition.

i. Safety and quality standards shall be scaled proportionally to demonstrated risk and production volume and shall not be structured to exclude small, independent, or non-industrial actors.
j. Pharmacist and Dispenser Good-Faith Immunity
Pharmacists, dispensers, and compounding professionals acting in good faith, within the scope of this Article, and with proper disclosure shall be immune from civil liability for harms arising from lawful dispensing absent fraud, recklessness, adulteration, or willful misrepresentation.

Section 4. Alcohol and Artisanal Production

The production, distribution, and consumption of alcohol are lawful adult activities subject to safety, purity, and transparency requirements.

a. Individuals may produce alcohol for personal use without licensing, provided such production does not involve sale or distribution to others.

b. Artisanal, small-scale, and independent alcohol producers shall not be subjected to industrial manufacturing standards, excessive taxation, or distribution requirements designed to favor large incumbents.

c. Direct-to-consumer sale and shipment of alcohol are lawful, subject only to age verification and reasonable fraud prevention measures.

d. No authority may impose surveillance, tracking, or behavioral monitoring systems on lawful alcohol purchase or consumption.

e. Taxes and fees applied to alcohol shall be uniform, transparent, and not structured to suppress small producers or function as disguised prohibition.

f. Public safety regulations related to intoxication shall address conduct that endangers others and shall not operate as moral enforcement.

Section 5. Intoxication, Responsibility, and Criminal Liability

The lawful use of any substance does not excuse criminal conduct.

a. Liability attaches to actions, not to the presence of substances in the body.

b. Intoxication shall not be a defense to crimes involving violence, negligence, or endangerment.

c. Where intoxication contributes to the commission of a Tier 3 crime under Article VII, it shall constitute an aggravating factor.

d. Nothing in this Article shall limit the admissibility of truthful, probative evidence in prosecutions for Tier 3 crimes.

Section 6. Trafficking, Adulteration, and Weaponized Substances

a. The adulteration of substances intended for human consumption constitutes a violent act against the public and shall be punished accordingly.

b. The manufacture, distribution, or use of substances intended to poison, incapacitate, or weaponize against others constitutes organized violent crime.

c. Trafficking offenses shall focus on coercion, fraud, adulteration, and distribution linked to violence or exploitation, rather than peaceful possession or consensual exchange.

d. Sentencing for trafficking shall scale with demonstrated harm, exploitation, and intent, not merely quantity.

e. Substance purity fraud shall be treated as aggravated fraud with enhanced penalties.

f. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to authorize broad prohibition or criminalization of lawful substances.

g. Emergency Containment
Temporary containment or restriction of a substance may occur only where there is a credible and imminent risk of mass harm.

Any emergency restriction imposed under this subsection shall expire automatically within ninety (90) days and may not be renewed, reissued, or extended indefinitely.

Each renewal requires a fresh legislative enactment by supermajority vote, public findings of necessity, and independent judicial review.

Section 7. Medical, Therapeutic, and Psychedelic Use

Medical autonomy and physician judgment are fundamental to patient-centered care.

a. Physicians and other licensed medical professionals may recommend, prescribe, or administer lawful substances consistent with patient needs, informed consent, and professional standards.

b. Therapeutic use of psychedelics and entheogens is lawful within medical, therapeutic, or supervised contexts where informed consent is present.

c. Patients may lawfully access therapeutic substances without arbitrary dosage caps or time limits unrelated to safety or efficacy.

d. No authority may require compulsory participation in registries, databases, or monitoring programs as a condition of lawful medical or therapeutic use.

e. Medical practitioners shall not be compelled to deny lawful treatment based on political, ideological, or institutional directives.

f. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to mandate treatment or to compel any individual to ingest or receive a substance against their will.

g. Medical confidentiality shall be preserved, subject only to narrowly tailored exceptions for imminent harm.

h. Access to lawful therapeutic substances shall not be restricted by geographic location, socioeconomic status, or institutional affiliation.

i. Experimental, compassionate-use, and right-to-try pathways shall remain open where informed consent is present and risks are disclosed.

j. Nothing in this Section shall limit the admissibility of truthful, probative evidence in prosecutions for Tier 3 crimes under Article VII.

k. Professional Board Limitation
No medical, pharmaceutical, or professional licensing board may discipline, sanction, or restrict a licensee solely for lawful conduct authorized under this Article.

Section 8. Performance Enhancement and Cognitive Liberty

a. The enhancement of physical or cognitive performance through lawful substances or methods is permitted where informed consent is present and no fraud or coercion occurs.

b. The Republic shall not criminalize enhancement for personal, professional, or competitive purposes.

c. Sporting organizations and private associations may regulate enhancement within competitions under their governance, provided such rules do not impose criminal penalties or public sanctions.

d. No authority may impose surveillance, testing, or monitoring for enhancement absent specific evidence of fraud, coercion, or endangerment.

Section 9. Review, De-Scheduling, and Liability Standards

a. Substances shall be subject to periodic review based on evolving evidence, safety data, and clinical outcomes.

b. Failure of the relevant authority to complete required review, reclassification, or de-scheduling within statutory timelines shall result in automatic provisional reclassification to the next less restrictive tier pending final determination.

c. No seller, pharmacist, manufacturer, or practitioner shall be held liable for harm resulting from lawful use absent fraud, recklessness, adulteration, or willful misrepresentation.

d. Collective liability doctrines based solely on association or distribution are prohibited.

e. No authority may delay, obstruct, or condition reclassification through procedural inertia or indefinite study.

Section 10. Employer, Institutional, and Insurance Non-Interference

a. Off-Duty Autonomy
Lawful use of substances under this Article shall not, standing alone, be grounds for denial of employment, housing, insurance, education, or professional opportunity.

b. Impairment Standard
Restrictions are permitted only where an employer, insurer, or institution demonstrates actual impairment during duty hours or safety-sensitive functions that materially affects specific, identified responsibilities.

c. No Moral or Lifestyle Governance
Off-duty, lawful conduct shall not be used as a basis for moral screening, lifestyle enforcement, ideological conformity, or proxy governance.

d. Burden of Proof
The burden rests on the restricting entity to demonstrate impairment or risk with objective evidence.

Section 11. Sunset, Preemption, and Anti-Cartel Enforcement

a. Sunset of Prohibition Authorities
All legacy drug-war statutes, emergency powers, and enforcement authorities inconsistent with this Article shall sunset within five (5) years of ratification unless reenacted in conformity with this Article.

b. Treaty Non-Self-Execution and Re-Ratification
No treaty, convention, guidance, or international coordination mechanism shall be deemed self-executing with respect to substance control.

Existing or prior international obligations inconsistent with this Article shall not bind the Republic absent explicit re-ratification consistent with Article XXVI.

No agency may enforce foreign substance restrictions absent express legislative enactment consistent with this Article.

c. No Semantic Re-Prohibition
Reclassification by analog, metabolite, derivative, or semantic substitution is prohibited absent evidence-based review and legislative approval.

d. Anti-Cartel Mandate
The Republic shall actively prevent the formation or maintenance of monopolies, cartels, or artificial scarcity in lawful substances through regulation, licensing, or enforcement practices.

e. Civil Asset Forfeiture Limitation
Property seized in violation of this Article shall be returned within fourteen (14) days. Failure to do so gives rise to damages and reasonable attorney fees.

Section 12. Construction

This Article shall be construed to:

a. end blanket prohibition permanently;
b. protect bodily autonomy and informed adult choice;
c. dismantle criminal and regulatory cartels;
d. punish violence, fraud, poisoning, and exploitation;
e. preserve medical, cognitive, and therapeutic liberty;
f. prevent agencies, corporations, or institutions from governing private life through coercion.

The Republic does not fear informed adults.
It fears concentrated power pretending to protect them.

Section 13. Essential Medicines, Fair Pricing, and Trade Integrity

a. Essential Medicines Defined
Essential medicines include substances required to preserve life, prevent irreversible catastrophic harm, or sustain ongoing survival in chronic conditions where interruption foreseeably results in serious injury or death.

b. Prohibition of Exploitative Pricing
No public or private entity possessing exclusive or dominant control over an essential medicine may impose prices that are grossly disproportionate to the combined and amortized costs of research, development, regulatory compliance, manufacture, distribution, and a reasonable risk-adjusted return.

c. Enforcement Trigger
Review under this Section may occur only upon complaint and a showing that:
	•	no reasonably available therapeutic substitute exists; and
	•	refusal or inability to pay the imposed price foreseeably results in serious harm or death.

d. Graduated Remedies
Upon a finding of exploitative pricing, remedies shall proceed in the following order:
	•	mandatory transparency sufficient for adjudication regarding aggregate costs and public funding received;
	•	judicial or independent determination of fair-access violation;
	•	compulsory licensing as a last resort, preserving patent ownership and providing reasonable royalty compensation.

e. Domestic Production Protection
The Republic shall encourage domestic manufacture of essential medicines and may provide lawful incentives to support resilient supply chains, provided such measures do not suppress competition or justify exploitative pricing.

f. Lawful Importation of Medicines
Essential medicines lawfully manufactured abroad may be imported where they meet domestic safety, purity, and labeling standards, particularly where foreign supply improves access, affordability, or continuity of care.

g. Ethical Trade and Tariffs
The Republic may impose proportional tariffs on medicines or components produced under conditions of forced labor, slavery, or coercive confinement.
Such tariffs shall:
	•	serve ethical correction rather than prohibition;
	•	not eliminate access to essential medicines where no reasonable alternative exists;
	•	not function as disguised protectionism or cartel enforcement.

h. Safety Supremacy
No medicine—domestic or foreign—shall be admitted or protected if it fails to meet objective safety and purity standards.

i. Construction
This Section shall be construed to preserve innovation, prevent extortion, protect life, and ensure that neither monopoly nor ideology determines who lives or dies.

Addendum: Emergency Medical Containment, Liability, and Transitional Safeguards
(Confirmatory Addendum — Doctrinal Clarification Only)

Section A. Non-Consensual Medical Containment — Confirmation

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to prohibit temporary non-consensual medical containment when required to prevent imminent and serious harm arising from:

a. Acute overdose or poisoning
b. Drug- or alcohol-induced psychosis
c. Violent intoxication presenting immediate danger
d. Severe withdrawal posing substantial risk of death or permanent injury

Such containment shall be medical and protective in nature, not punitive, and shall be governed exclusively by the Capacity-Based Intervention Principle.

Section B. Mandatory Treatment Offer During Containment

During any period of non-consensual medical containment authorized under this Article:

a. The individual shall be affirmatively offered appropriate medical treatment, stabilization, and evidence-based withdrawal or detoxification care.
b. Treatment shall not be conditioned on confession, cooperation, or waiver of rights.
c. Refusal of non-emergency treatment shall not extend the duration of containment beyond what is necessary to address imminent risk.

Section C. Limited Liability Shield for Good-Faith Actors

To prevent defensive denial of emergency care, pharmacists, bartenders, and similarly situated lawful service providers shall not be held civilly or criminally liable for outcomes arising from lawful provision of substances, absent clear evidence of:

a. Gross negligence
b. Willful misconduct
c. Deliberate poisoning or reckless endangerment

This protection shall not extend to unlawful distribution, adulteration, or knowing facilitation of imminent harm.

Section D. Emergency Scheduling Authority for Novel or Weaponized Substances

The Republic may establish a temporary emergency scheduling mechanism for:

a. Novel fentanyl analogs
b. Rapidly mutating synthetic intoxicants
c. Weaponized or mass-harm substances

Such emergency scheduling shall:

a. Be time-limited
b. Require public disclosure of scientific justification
c. Trigger expedited review for permanent classification or removal
d. Not be used to bypass legislative authority through indefinite renewal

Section E. Transitional Provisions for Legacy Opioid and Dependency Populations

Recognizing reliance created under prior medical and regulatory regimes:

a. Individuals with long-term dependency arising from lawful medical prescribing shall be entitled to medically supervised transition pathways, not abrupt deprivation.
b. No person shall be criminalized solely for physiological dependence created under prior legal standards.
c. Public health infrastructure shall prioritize stabilization, tapering options, and humane continuity of care.

Section F. Cross-Reference and Controlling Doctrine

All non-consensual interventions, emergency holds, and containment actions under this Article are governed by the Capacity-Based Intervention Principle, which controls evidentiary thresholds, duration, review, and restoration.

Nothing in this Article authorizes indefinite medical detention or coercive treatment absent constitutional compliance.

Section G. Locking Clause

This addendum clarifies interpretation only and does not reopen or amend the underlying text of Article XXXIV.
Upon adoption, Article XXXIV shall remain locked, subject only to formal constitutional amendment.


Article XXXV — Science, Knowledge, and the Integrity of Truth

Charge

A Republic that abandons truth abandons self-government.

Science, scholarship, and discovery exist to illuminate reality as it is—not as ideology, prestige, funding, or fashion would prefer it to be. Where inquiry becomes subordinated to narrative, where evidence yields to orthodoxy, or where dissent is punished rather than tested, knowledge decays into propaganda and civilization stagnates.

This Article secures the independence, rigor, and honesty of scientific and scholarly endeavor, ensuring that knowledge serves truth, human flourishing, and the long-term needs of the Republic—not institutional self-preservation or political convenience.
For purposes of this Article, “truth” refers to correspondence with reality as determined through evidence, reproducible methods, and open challenge, and not to official declaration or authority.

Section 1. Purpose of Science and Scholarship

Scientific, archaeological, anthropological, and academic inquiry within the Republic shall be oriented toward:

a. discovery of objective reality through evidence and reason;
b. falsifiability, replication, and methodological rigor;
c. honest uncertainty where evidence is incomplete;
d. technological, medical, and civilizational advancement;
e. preservation of historical truth without ideological distortion.
No discipline shall be insulated from challenge by appeal to authority, consensus alone, or institutional status.
These orientations govern the conduct and evaluation of publicly funded, publicly empowered, or publicly relied-upon inquiry, and do not prescribe conclusions or restrict good-faith disagreement.

Section 2. Evidence Over Narrative

All publicly funded research, scholarship, and excavation shall adhere to the principle that:

Evidence governs conclusions, not conclusions governing evidence.

It shall be prohibited to:

a. suppress data inconsistent with prevailing theories;
b. destroy, conceal, or withhold artifacts, samples, or records for reputational, ideological, or political reasons;
c. reinterpret findings to fit predetermined narratives absent evidentiary support;
d. prohibit lawful alternative hypotheses from being explored, published, or debated.
Deliberate deletion, corruption, manipulation, or suppression of primary digital data, archives, research corpora, or training datasets for ideological, political, reputational, or institutional reasons shall constitute destruction of evidence under this Article.
Any person, institution, or affected researcher shall have standing to petition the Constitutional Review Court for preservation orders, disclosure, injunctions, and constitutional remedies upon a prima facie showing of evidentiary suppression or risk of spoliation.
Where credible, reproducible evidence contradicts established theory, theory must yield to the extent required by the evidence.
All preservation orders, disclosures, datasets, and archives required under this Article shall be lodged with or mirrored to the Public Ministry of Records pursuant to Article XXXIX.

Section 3. Peer Review as Truth-Seeking, Not Gatekeeping

Peer review shall function as a method of error correction, not ideological enforcement.

Accordingly:

a. anonymous review shall be permitted but not mandatory, provided that anonymity shall not be used to evade accountability for suppression or misconduct;
b. dissenting or minority findings may not be rejected solely for contradicting prevailing consensus;
c. methodological criticism must be specific, substantive, and evidentiary;
d. replication studies shall be valued equally to novel findings.
Procedural delay, indefinite review, serial demands for non-material revisions, or administrative obstruction used to prevent lawful publication, replication, or dissemination shall be treated as suppression under this Article.
The Constitutional Review Court shall have authority to enjoin abusive peer review, order publication, compel disclosure of review records, and impose constitutional remedies where this Section is violated, subject to remedies narrowly tailored to cure suppression without compelling substantive endorsement.
Systematic abuse of peer review to suppress dissent, competitors, or heterodox inquiry shall constitute professional misconduct.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall audit peer review systems, funding bodies, and publication pipelines for systemic abuse, cartelization, or ideological gatekeeping.

Section 4. Academic Freedom and Accountability

Academic freedom protects inquiry, not falsehood.

Researchers and scholars shall enjoy full freedom to:

a. pursue lawful research;
b. publish findings;
c. criticize prevailing theories;
d. revise or abandon their own conclusions.

Such freedom does not shield:

a. fabrication or falsification of data;
b. deliberate misrepresentation of findings;
c. retaliation against dissenters;
d. misuse of academic authority to coerce belief.

Academic misconduct shall be subject to transparent investigation and sanction consistent with due process, including notice, evidentiary disclosure, opportunity to respond, and neutral adjudication.
Good-faith error, failed hypotheses, or conclusions later shown to be incorrect shall not, by themselves, constitute misconduct.
The Constitutional Review Court may order reinstatement, funding restoration, injunctive relief, and suppression of retaliatory actions subject to remedies narrowly tailored to cure the violation without compelling belief, endorsement, or substantive conclusions.
For purposes of this Section, “academic authority” includes control over grading, credentialing, funding recommendations, publication access, hiring, tenure, or professional standing exercised under color of institutional power.

Section 5. Archaeology, Anthropology, and Historical Integrity

Archaeological and anthropological inquiry shall be conducted with:

a. preservation of physical evidence;
b. transparency of methods and provenance;
c. open access to primary data where feasible;
d. respect for cultural heritage without surrendering scientific integrity.
Where excavation, extraction, or destructive testing is conducted, complete documentation and preservation of primary evidence shall be required to the maximum extent feasible.
No political, ideological, religious, identitarian, or reputational claim shall override, suppress, or displace material evidence.
The Republic rejects both mythologizing the past and sanitizing it.

Section 6. Public Funding, Transparency, and Replication

Publicly funded research shall require:

a. disclosure of funding sources and conflicts of interest;
b. publication of underlying data where security, privacy, or narrowly defined national defense considerations permit;
c. allowance for independent replication and audit;
d. sunset review of funding programs tied to demonstrated results.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to investigate publicly funded research bodies, academic institutions, data repositories, and accreditation authorities for institutional capture, ideological enforcement, funding coercion, or suppression of lawful inquiry, and may certify such findings to the Constitutional Review Court.

Funding mechanisms shall not be structured to reward conformity, ideological alignment, or institutional entrenchment.

Funding, publication, or career advancement systems shall not be structured to indirectly suppress lawful inquiry, including through algorithmic scoring systems, automated review pipelines, or opaque evaluative criteria.

Section 7. Protection of Heterodox and Minority Inquiry

The Republic affirms that many advances arise from minority views.

No scholar shall suffer loss of position, funding, or professional standing solely for:

a. proposing unpopular hypotheses;
b. challenging dominant frameworks;
c. publishing inconvenient findings.
No adverse action may be justified by pretextual allegations where the substantial motivating factor is protected inquiry under this Section.
Claims shall rise or fall on evidence and method alone.
Where adverse action is taken against a scholar engaged in protected inquiry, the burden shall rest on the institution to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that such action was unrelated to the protected activity.

Section 8. Science in Service of the Republic

Scientific and scholarly institutions exist to serve:

a. truth;
b. human well-being;
c. technological advancement;
d. public safety;
e. informed self-government.

They shall not operate as:

a. ideological enforcement arms;
b. unaccountable priesthoods;
c. closed guilds hostile to correction.

Obligations under this Article attach directly to publicly funded or publicly empowered institutions; private institutions remain free but may not claim public authority, funding, or accreditation while systematically violating its principles, including eligibility for accreditation, credential recognition, and access to public research consortia.
For purposes of this Article, “publicly empowered” includes any institution or body granted regulatory authority, licensing power, accreditation authority, exclusive advisory status, or formal reliance in public decision-making.
Section 9. Rules of Construction and Scope

This Article shall be construed to protect and enforce the integrity of scientific and scholarly processes, including open inquiry, falsifiability, reproducibility, and good-faith challenge, rather than to mandate or privilege any particular conclusion, theory, or narrative.
In applying this Article, no court, agency, or officer of the Republic shall treat consensus, authority, institutional prestige, or popularity as a substitute for evidence, reproducibility, or methodological transparency.
No obligation or prohibition under this Article may be delegated to private actors in a manner that evades constitutional accountability.
Obligations, duties, and enforcement mechanisms under this Article apply only to institutions, bodies, and activities that are publicly funded, publicly empowered, publicly accredited, or explicitly relied upon by the Republic for official decision-making, certification, regulation, or public record, except where private conduct constitutes the destruction, concealment, falsification, or suppression of evidence of public, historical, or scientific significance.
Nothing in this Article authorizes the Republic to declare scientific conclusions as true or false. The Republic’s authority is limited to safeguarding the processes by which truth is pursued, tested, challenged, preserved, and recorded.
Such private conduct shall be subject to this Article only to the extent necessary to preserve, recover, or prevent the loss of such evidence.
Section 10. Cultural and Historical Sites — Public Trust with Just Compensation

a. Public Trust Doctrine for Irreplaceable Heritage
Archaeological, historical, and culturally significant sites of demonstrable and exceptional value to human knowledge or collective heritage may be designated as protected cultural sites held in public trust, regardless of prior ownership.

Such designation exists solely for preservation, study, and public benefit—not ideological, political, or economic exploitation.

b. Just Compensation Requirement
No private land, structure, or improvement shall be seized, restricted, or materially encumbered under this Article without fair and prompt compensation, reflecting:
	•	market value absent designation,
	•	loss of reasonable use, and
	•	documented economic impact.

Compensation shall be mandatory, not discretionary.
Compensation determinations shall be subject to judicial review and may not be deferred, conditioned, or substituted with regulatory permission alone.

c. No Constructive Confiscation
Regulatory burdens imposed under cultural protection shall not be used to render property economically nonviable as a means of de facto seizure.

Where preservation materially restricts ordinary use, compensation or acquisition shall be required.
For purposes of this Section, “exceptional value” shall mean significance that is rare, non-replicable, and materially advances historical, scientific, or cultural understanding beyond ordinary local interest.

Section 11. Evidentiary Threshold for Site Designation

a. High Standard of Proof
Designation of protected cultural status shall require clear, material, and independently verifiable evidence of genuine historical or scientific significance.
Speculative claims, disputed interpretations, or isolated minor artifacts shall not suffice.
All evidence relied upon for designation shall be preserved, documented, and made part of a publicly accessible evidentiary record, subject to narrow redactions for site protection.
b. Anti-Abuse Clause
The presence of incidental artifacts, isolated pottery fragments, or non-contextual remnants shall not be used to justify:
	•	blanket land confiscation,
	•	indefinite construction bans, or
	•	arbitrary expansion of protected zones.

Designation must be narrow, site-specific, and evidence-driven.
Expansion of a protected zone beyond the footprint supported by evidence shall require a renewed evidentiary showing meeting the same standard as initial designation.
c. Independent Review
All designations shall be subject to review by an independent, multidisciplinary body insulated from political, ideological, or financial pressure.
Any affected landowner, researcher, or citizen shall have standing to challenge designation, expansion, restriction, or enforcement actions taken under this Article.

Section 12. Preservation with Public Access

a. Presumption of Public Access
Protected sites held in public trust shall, wherever reasonably feasible, be made accessible to the public, subject to:
	•	conservation requirements,
	•	safety constraints, and
	•	cultural sensitivity.

Preservation shall not be used as a pretext for secrecy, exclusivity, or academic hoarding.
Restrictions on access shall be the least restrictive means necessary to achieve conservation or safety objectives.
b. Balanced Access Models
Access may include guided visitation, controlled entry, seasonal access, digital replication, or other methods that preserve both integrity and public benefit.
Permanent closure shall require compelling justification and periodic review.
Any restriction resulting in closure or materially limited access shall be subject to periodic review at intervals not exceeding five (5) years.

Section 13. Absolute Prohibition of Looting, Theft, and Vandalism
a. Crimes Against Civilization
The intentional and knowing looting, destruction, theft, trafficking, or defacement of protected cultural, archaeological, or historical materials shall constitute grave offenses against the Republic, distinct from ordinary property crimes.
The use of cultural artifacts, antiquities, or historically significant objects as instruments for money laundering, sanctions evasion, tax evasion, or concealment of criminal proceeds constitutes a grave offense against the Republic.  No transaction involving protected cultural materials shall be afforded legal recognition absent verifiable provenance, lawful custody, and transparent beneficial ownership.
b. Enhanced Penalties
No transaction involving protected cultural materials shall be afforded legal recognition.
Such offenses shall carry severe criminal penalties, including:
	•	long-term imprisonment,
	•	forfeiture of proceeds and instrumentalities,
	•	permanent exclusion from cultural, academic, or excavation privileges,
	•	and any such transaction shall be void ab initio.
c. Claims for Repatriation
Claims for repatriation of cultural artifacts shall be evaluated solely on evidentiary, historical, custodial, and preservation grounds, and shall not be compelled by political pressure, diplomatic leverage, ideological claims, or threats.
Burden of proof shall rest on the claimant to establish lawful origin, continuity of custody, and capacity for preservation.
No statute of limitations shall apply to major cultural theft or destruction.

Section 14. Armed Protection and Use of Force Authorization

a. Authority to Guard Protected Sites
The Republic may authorize by statute or narrowly tailored executive order subject to legislative oversight, including armed guards—public or deputized—to protect designated cultural and historical sites of exceptional importance.

Such protection is deemed a defense of irreplaceable public trust assets.

b. Use of Lethal Force
Where an individual is caught in the act of:
	•	destroying,
	•	stealing,
	•	irreversibly damaging, or
	•	attempting to remove protected artifacts or structures,

and where such loss would constitute irreparable harm to human heritage, and no other means reasonably available would prevent the loss, lethal force is constitutionally authorized as a last resort.

c. No Duty to Retreat
Guards acting under this authority shall have no duty to retreat when preventing the active destruction or theft of protected heritage.
Any use of lethal force under this Section shall be subject to prompt independent review consistent with Article XXIV, without presumption of wrongdoing.
d. Harmonization with Articles VII and XXIV
Use of force under this Section shall be construed as defensive and preventive, not punitive, and shall be evaluated under the principles of necessity, proportionality, and last resort, with proportionality assessed in light of the irreparable civilizational harm prevented.

Section 15. Prohibition on Ideological or Opportunistic Designation
Cultural protection shall never be used to:
	•	dispossess political opponents,
	•	advance religious or identitarian claims unsupported by evidence,
	•	block lawful development absent genuine historical necessity, or
	•	entrench academic monopolies.
Claims of sacred, cultural, or historical status unsupported by material evidence shall confer no special protection, restriction, or designation under this Article.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to audit and certify whether cultural, archaeological, or historical designations are being used as instruments of political dispossession, academic monopoly, or ideological control.
All authority under this Article exists to preserve truth and heritage, not to weaponize them.
Where abuse is found, the Constitutional Review Court may invalidate designations, restore property rights, award compensation, and enjoin further misuse of authority.

Section 16. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted and applied to:
(a) preserve civilization and irreplaceable heritage while respecting private property rights and the requirement of just compensation;
(b) protect knowledge, inquiry, and evidence without authorizing ideological coercion, compelled belief, or institutional orthodoxy;
(c) maximize public access and transparency consistent with conservation, safety, and evidentiary integrity;
(d) authorize protective measures proportionate to the demonstrated irreplaceability and civilizational significance of the threatened loss.

In construing this Article, courts and officers of the Republic shall give weight to the principle that destruction of non-replicable knowledge, evidence, or heritage constitutes irreversible harm warranting heightened protection, subject always to necessity, proportionality, and due process.

Article XXXVI — Transition, Accession, and Discontinuity of Power

(Authoritative Integrated Text — Section-by-Section Print)

Charge

No lawful Republic may arise from confusion, nor endure through ambiguity.

The moment of transition—whether at founding, reunification, annexation, or accession—is the hour of greatest danger. Power clings to habit. Authority masquerades as continuity. Institutions resist accountability by invoking tradition, emergency, or expertise.

This Article exists to ensure that all authority within the Republic arises only from this Constitution, that no power survives by inertia or custom, and that transitions of sovereignty occur openly, lawfully, and without shadow rule.

The purpose of transition is not preservation of privilege, but the lawful reconstitution of authority under consent, clarity, and accountability.

Section 1. Constitutional Supremacy at Inception

Upon ratification of this Constitution, or upon lawful accession of any territory, state, or polity:

a. this Constitution shall take immediate and supreme effect;
b. all prior constitutional, statutory, executive, customary, or prerogative authorities inconsistent with it are hereby extinguished;
c. no office, power, or discretion shall survive by tradition, convention, precedent, or implied necessity.

Authority exists only where expressly conferred by this Constitution or by laws enacted pursuant to it.

Section 2. Discontinuity of Prior Executive Authority

Upon transition:

a. all executive powers not expressly reconstituted by this Constitution are void;
b. no individual may exercise authority by virtue of prior title, office, or role;
c. no interim, caretaker, emergency, or advisory authority may exercise binding power absent express constitutional or legislative authorization.

Former heads of state, heads of government, ministers, prime ministers, or equivalent officials shall possess no authority beyond that granted to any other citizen or legislator.

Section 3. Temporary Continuity of Essential Services

To prevent harm to life, safety, or basic civil order:

a. essential services may continue to operate temporarily under transitional authority;
b. such authority shall be strictly limited to operational continuity;
c. no new policy, rulemaking, enforcement expansion, or discretionary power may be exercised absent lawful delegation.

Essential services shall be defined by statute prior to transition, with judicial review available for any expansion.

Transitional operational authority shall be exercised only by persons or bodies designated by law enacted pursuant to this Constitution.

All transitional authorities shall sunset automatically within a defined period not to exceed eighteen (18) months unless earlier replaced or reauthorized by law.

 Section 3A. Sunset of Legacy Administrative Bodies

All administrative bodies, agencies, departments, commissions, or instrumentalities exercising authority by custom, implication, historical practice, executive continuity, or pre-constitutional delegation shall be deemed provisional upon ratification of this Constitution.

Such bodies shall sunset automatically within a period not to exceed five (5) years from ratification unless expressly reauthorized by statute enacted pursuant to this Constitution and consistent with Article XXI.

No claim of operational necessity, expertise, continuity, emergency, funding obligation, or public reliance shall extend or preserve authority beyond this sunset period absent such reauthorization.

Acts taken by any body after expiration of its authority shall be void and shall constitute usurpation of public authority under Article VII.


Section 4. Prohibition of Shadow Governance

During transition and thereafter:

a. no advisory body, coordination council, emergency committee, or task force may exercise binding authority;
b. no power may be exercised through informal guidance, expectation, pressure, or custom;
c. no official may issue directives absent lawful authority and recorded accountability.

No foreign government, institution, or agent may exercise advisory, financial, security, or administrative influence over transitional authority absent express constitutional or legislative authorization.

Any attempt to govern through ambiguity, urgency, or extralegal coordination shall constitute usurpation of authority under Article VII.

Section 5. Oath, Reconstitution, and Vetting of Officials

All persons exercising public authority after transition must:

a. swear a new oath to this Constitution;
b. acknowledge the nullification of prior prerogative authority;
c. accept personal liability for acts taken without lawful authorization.

Failure to re-oath or continued assertion of former authority shall result in immediate removal and disqualification.

Section 6. Accession of States, Polities, and Nations

Any territory, state, or nation acceding to the Republic may:

a. retain cultural, ceremonial, or symbolic institutions;
b. preserve local legal traditions consistent with constitutional supremacy;
c. maintain non-executive hereditary or customary offices.

No ceremonial or symbolic office shall:

a. exercise executive, legislative, or judicial power;
b. confer civic citizenship by title alone;
c. override elected or constitutional authority.

All persons, regardless of title, are subject to equal law and civic obligation.

Any vote, referendum, or formal expression of consent regarding accession, independence, or territorial status under this Article shall be conducted solely by an electorate meeting the standards of Civic Citizenship defined in Article III, or by a transitional electorate meeting equivalent civic qualifications as established by law and subject to judicial review.

Section 7. Treatment of Ceremonial Heads of State

Where an acceding state retains a ceremonial monarch, crown, or equivalent:

a. such office shall be purely symbolic;
b. no authority shall attach by lineage or tradition;
c. the officeholder shall possess no immunity beyond personal security protections granted by law.

Personal security protections for ceremonial figures shall be limited to reasonable measures necessary for physical safety, without conferring immunity, privilege, or political influence.

Ceremonial figures shall not substitute for governors, executives, or constitutional officers.

Section 8. Judicial and Legislative Oversight During Transition

All transitional actions are subject to:

a. judicial review without deference;
b. legislative inquiry and recorded oversight;
c. citizen standing for challenge of unlawful authority.

Judicial review shall be available within thirty (30) days of filing upon citizen challenge of any transitional action.

Courts shall construe this Article strictly against implied power and broadly against institutional inertia.

Section 9. Criminalization of Usurpation

Any person who knowingly:

a. exercises authority not granted by this Constitution;
b. issues directives under color of extinguished office;
c. obstructs lawful transition through deception, delay, or sabotage;
d. coordinates extrajudicial governance;

shall be guilty of usurpation of public authority and subject to criminal penalty, removal, and permanent disqualification.

Good-faith transitional errors not involving malice or personal gain may be subject to administrative sanction rather than criminal penalty, as provided by law.

Section 10. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to:

a. extinguish power by habit;
b. prevent executive resurrection by custom;
c. deny legitimacy to shadow governance;
d. favor clarity over continuity;
e. ensure that no Republic is born half-free.

Section 11. Irrevocability of Accession and Suppression of Secession

Upon lawful accession of any territory, state, polity, or nation to the Republic:

a. accession shall be permanent and irrevocable absent constitutional amendment enacted pursuant to this Constitution;
b. no region, subdivision, faction, institution, or association within the acceded territory possesses any right to secede, partition, reclaim prior sovereignty, or reconstitute former governments;
c. all prior claims of sovereignty, independence, or right of withdrawal are extinguished upon accession.

Any attempt, whether by force, coercion, declaration, referendum, or coordinated action, to:

a. establish a breakaway state or government;
b. reclaim authority under a former constitutional or monarchical system;
c. partition territory from the Republic;
d. invite or accept foreign recognition or protection for such purposes;

shall constitute rebellion against the Republic.

The Republic shall possess both the right and the duty to suppress such rebellion by all necessary and proportionate means, including the use of force, to preserve territorial integrity, constitutional order, and the equal protection of the People.

Suppression shall be proportionate, subject to due process, and shall not include mass detention absent individualized probable cause.

No claim of tradition, self-determination, cultural grievance, historic sovereignty, or political dissatisfaction shall excuse or legitimize acts of secession or territorial dismemberment once accession has lawfully occurred.

Section 12. Protection of Lawful Dissent

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to prohibit:

a. lawful political opposition;
b. advocacy for constitutional amendment;
c. cultural autonomy consistent with constitutional supremacy;
d. peaceful expression of dissent within the framework of this Constitution.

The prohibition herein applies solely to attempts to dissolve, fragment, or withdraw territory from the Republic outside constitutional process.


Article XXXVI-A — Determination of Subordinate Government Failure

Section 1. Presumption of Local Self-Governance

Subordinate governments are presumed capable of lawful self-governance.
Such presumption may be rebutted only upon clear and convincing evidence, through the procedures set forth herein.

⸻

Section 2. Federal Investigative Trigger

Where credible, corroborated evidence indicates that a subordinate government has materially abdicated its civic responsibilities or is acting in a criminal or hostile manner toward the People or the Republic, the Federal Government shall have authority to initiate an independent investigation, notwithstanding the absence of a local petition.

Credible evidence may include, but is not limited to:
	1.	verified financial records;
	2.	judicial findings or indictments;
	3.	independent audits;
	4.	intelligence lawfully obtained and declassified to the maximum extent possible;
	5.	patterns of violent crime, infrastructure collapse, or rights violations demonstrable by objective metrics.

Investigative initiation does not constitute intervention and confers no governing authority.

⸻

Section 3. Independent Investigation

Any investigation under this Article shall:
	1.	be conducted by an independent federal body insulated from political direction;
	2.	be limited in scope and duration;
	3.	produce a public evidentiary report, subject to redaction only where strictly necessary to protect life or ongoing prosecutions;
	4.	be subject to judicial supervision upon petition.

Failure to meet evidentiary sufficiency terminates the process.

⸻

Section 4. Formal Adjudication

Upon a finding of sufficient evidence, the subordinate government entity shall be formally charged and brought before the Constitutional Review Court.

The proceeding shall:
	1.	be adversarial;
	2.	afford full due process;
	3.	permit defense by the accused governing body;
	4.	require proof by clear and convincing evidence.

Emergency declarations under Article XXXVIII do not substitute for this adjudication.

⸻

Section 5. Grounds for Conviction

Conviction may occur only upon proof of one or more of the following, shown to be systemic and persistent:
	1.	Abdication of Governance — sustained failure to enact or execute lawful governance.
	2.	Criminal Capture — demonstrable subordination to organized crime or corruption.
	3.	Hostile Governance — deliberate action against the constitutional order or the rights of the People.
	4.	Public Safety Collapse — sustained inability or refusal to protect life.
	5.	Rights Breakdown — material violations of inviolable rights not remediable by ordinary judicial relief.
	6.	Infrastructure Dereliction — collapse rendering basic habitation or mobility untenable.

⸻

Section 6. Consequences of Conviction

Upon conviction:
	1.	the offending governing body shall be dissolved or suspended;
	2.	authority shall be transferred to temporary, court-approved stewards;
	3.	individual officials found culpable shall:
	•	face all applicable criminal penalties;
	•	be permanently barred from public office;
	•	forfeit civic citizenship where constitutionally permitted under Article III.

Collective punishment of residents is prohibited.

⸻

Section 7. Nature of Stewardship

Stewardship imposed under this Article shall be:
	1.	temporary;
	2.	narrowly tailored to failed functions;
	3.	subject to periodic judicial review;
	4.	bound by a mandatory restoration plan.

Stewards hold authority in trust, not sovereignty.

⸻

Section 8. Relationship to Intervention

A conviction under this Article establishes eligibility for temporary remedial action under Article XXXIV-B, and for no other purpose.

No military force, federal policing, or emergency powers may be exercised absent independent authorization under Articles XXIV, XXX, or XXXVIII.

⸻

Section 9. Construction

This Article shall be construed:
	•	in favor of decisiveness where evidence is overwhelming,
	•	in favor of due process where evidence is contested,
	•	against permanent federal control,
	•	against political or partisan application.

Failure of governance is a legal condition, not a moral identity.

⸻

Article XXXVI-B — Subordinate Government Failure and Federal Stewardship Intervention

Section 1. Preconditions to Intervention

Federal stewardship intervention may occur only after:
	1.	a final judicial determination under Article XXXVI-A that a subordinate government has failed; and
	2.	a written order specifying the functions adjudged failed, the scope of remedy, and the duration.

No intervention may proceed by declaration, inference, or emergency pretext alone.

⸻

Section 2. Nature of Intervention

Intervention under this Article is stewardship, not governance.

Accordingly:
	1.	authority is temporary and functional, limited to the failed functions identified by the court;
	2.	sovereignty remains with the People and the lawful constitutional order;
	3.	all actions shall conform to Article XXVI (Rights Supremacy) and Article XXVIII (Federalism).

⸻

Section 3. Appointment of Stewards

Upon authorization, the Constitutional Review Court shall appoint, subject to appellate review by the Supreme Court to execute the limited remedial mandate.

Stewards shall:
	1.	be vetted for independence, competence, and absence of conflicts;
	2.	swear an oath to restore lawful self-governance and to exit upon satisfaction of benchmarks;
	3.	operate under continuing judicial supervision.

No steward may simultaneously hold partisan office or seek electoral advantage from stewardship.

⸻

Section 4. Scope of Authority

Stewards may exercise only those powers necessary to:
	1.	restore basic public safety and essential services;
	2.	secure finances and prevent further dissipation of public assets;
	3.	remediate rights violations adjudged under XXXVI-A;
	4.	reestablish lawful administrative capacity.

Stewards shall not:
	•	restructure political institutions beyond what is strictly necessary for lawful function;
	•	alter electoral rules except as ordered by the court to cure adjudicated defects;
	•	privatize public assets except where required to prevent imminent loss and approved by the court.

⸻

Section 5. Prohibitions

Intervention shall not be used to:
	1.	impose ideological programs or partisan agendas;
	2.	engineer demographic, cultural, or economic outcomes unrelated to remediation;
	3.	displace lawful private labor through coercion;
	4.	expand federal authority beyond the remedial mandate.

Collective punishment of residents is prohibited.

⸻

Section 6. Duration and Sunset

Every stewardship order shall include:
	1.	a fixed term not to exceed that necessary to accomplish the remedial objectives;
	2.	automatic sunset absent affirmative judicial renewal upon a showing of necessity;
	3.	periodic review at intervals prescribed by law.

Failure to meet renewal standards terminates the intervention.

⸻

Section 7. Restoration Benchmarks

At initiation, the court shall approve a Restoration Plan specifying:
	1.	objective benchmarks for capacity, legality, and rights compliance;
	2.	timelines for reconstitution of local authority;
	3.	conditions for elections, ratification, or reinstatement as appropriate.

Benchmarks shall be public and justiciable.

⸻

Section 8. Accountability

Stewards are subject to:
	1.	full transparency and public reporting;
	2.	independent audit;
	3.	civil and criminal liability for intentional or reckless misconduct;
	4.	removal by the court for cause.

No immunity attaches by virtue of stewardship.

⸻

Section 9. Coordination with Other Authorities

Nothing in this Article authorizes:
	•	military deployment, except as separately permitted under Article XXIV;
	•	emergency powers, except as separately invoked under Article XXXVIII;
	•	intelligence operations or coercive policing beyond lawful mandates.

Coordination, where necessary, shall remain subordinate to judicial orders herein.

⸻

Section 10. Exit and Handover

Upon satisfaction of restoration benchmarks:
	1.	stewardship authority shall cease automatically;
	2.	lawful local governance shall be fully restored;
	3.	all records shall be transferred to local custody;
	4.	a final public accounting shall be issued.

No residual federal control may persist.

⸻

Section 11. Construction

This Article shall be construed narrowly:
	•	to enable decisive remediation where adjudicated failure exists;
	•	to prevent permanence, pretext, or expansion;
	•	to favor the earliest lawful return to self-governance.

Failure warrants remedy; remedy does not justify rule.

⸻

Article XXXVI-C — Restoration, Exit, and Reconstitution

Section 1. Mandatory Orientation Toward Restoration

All actions taken pursuant to Articles XXXVI-A and XXXVI-B shall be directed toward the prompt restoration of lawful self-governance.

Stewardship exists solely to cure adjudicated failure and shall not be used to redesign political identity, ideology, or culture.

⸻

Section 2. Restoration Plan and Public Benchmarks

At the commencement of stewardship, a Restoration Plan shall be adopted by the supervising court, specifying:
	1.	objective benchmarks for administrative capacity, fiscal integrity, public safety, and rights compliance;
	2.	timelines for achieving each benchmark;
	3.	conditions for the return or reconstitution of local authority;
	4.	procedures for public reporting and contestation.

Benchmarks shall be measurable, public, and justiciable.

⸻

Section 3. Reconstitution of Local Authority

Upon substantial compliance with restoration benchmarks:
	1.	lawful local authority shall be reinstated or reconstituted;
	2.	interim appointments shall cease;
	3.	elections or ratifications shall occur where required to restore legitimacy.

No individual removed for cause under Article XXXVI-A may reassume authority absent judicial clearance.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall audit and certify the independence, scope, and good-faith conduct of such investigations.


⸻

Section 4. Automatic Exit

Federal stewardship shall terminate automatically upon certification the Constitutional Review Court that restoration benchmarks have been met.

No further legislative, executive, or administrative action is required to effect exit.

Failure to certify shall require written findings specifying remaining deficiencies and a narrow continuation order.

⸻

Section 5. Prohibition on Residual Control

Upon termination:
	1.	all federal control, supervision, and extraordinary authority shall cease;
	2.	all records, assets, and functions shall be returned to local custody;
	3.	no continuing conditions, monitoring regimes, or consent decrees may persist absent fresh judicial findings.

Stewardship shall not convert into oversight by inertia.

⸻

Section 6. Final Accounting and Review

Within a defined period after exit:
	1.	a final public accounting shall be issued;
	2.	an independent audit shall assess compliance, costs, and outcomes;
	3.	affected residents shall retain standing to challenge overreach or unlawful conduct.

Findings shall inform future statutory safeguards.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall conduct or supervise such audits and may refer misconduct to the Constitutional Review Court or prosecutors.

⸻

Section 7. Liability and Redress

Nothing in this Article limits:
	1.	civil or criminal liability for misconduct by stewards or officials;
	2.	remedies for rights violations suffered during stewardship;
	3.	forfeiture of civic citizenship imposed upon conviction under Article XXXVI-A.

Restoration does not erase accountability.

⸻

Section 8. Construction

This Article shall be construed:
	•	to favor the earliest lawful return to self-governance;
	•	against permanence, pretext, or expansion of stewardship;
	•	in harmony with Articles XXVI (Rights Supremacy), XXVIII (Federalism), and XXXVIII (Emergency Powers).
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to investigate stewards, certify abuse, and petition the Constitutional Review Court for removal, sanctions, or termination of stewardship.
The Constitutional Review Court shall have emergency jurisdiction to stay, enjoin, or void any transitional action upon a prima facie showing of unlawful authority, institutional capture, or shadow governance, including upon petition by the CJC.
Exit is the rule; continuation is the exception.

⸻

Article XXXVII — Environmental and Ecological Stewardship

Charge

A Republic that consumes its land, water, and air without restraint mortgages the future and betrays those not yet born.

Environmental stewardship is not ideology, superstition, or narrative — it is the rational preservation of the natural systems upon which life, agriculture, health, and civilization depend. This Article affirms a duty of care grounded in evidence, proportionality, intergenerational responsibility, and respect for individual rights.

Section 1. Duty of Stewardship

The Republic and its agents recognize an affirmative duty to preserve and protect land, water, air, soil, biodiversity, and ecological systems essential to human life, prosperity, and the rights of present and future generations.

This duty shall be legislative in character and supervisory in nature and shall be discharged through evidence-based measures enacted pursuant to legislative authority, with due regard for property rights, human flourishing, and the enforcement structures established elsewhere in this Constitution.
Neglect, waste, or predatory degradation of land, water, air, or ecological systems that materially harms the Republic or its posterity shall constitute a grave offense, subject to enforcement and sanction pursuant to Article VII, and shall be construed in harmony with the stewardship duties established in Article IX.
Ecological stewardship may include the restoration, cultivation, and transmission of native and historically adapted plant species, where such practices advance biodiversity, food resilience, and environmental stability, consistent with evidence and local conditions.

Section 2. Evidence Over Narrative

Environmental policy and enforcement shall be grounded in:

a. empirical observation, reproducible data, and falsifiable measurement;
b. transparent quantification of risk, harm, and benefit;
c. proportional response only to demonstrated, material harm or imminent threat that is reasonably certain and substantial, supported by clear and convincing evidence subject to adversarial testing and judicial review.
No policy, regulation, or restriction shall be justified by speculative modeling, ideological narrative, asserted consensus, precautionary assumptions absent material evidence, or fear of uncertain future harm.
Where scientific uncertainty exists, the presumption shall favor liberty, private property rights, family-scale production, and economic productivity unless clear and convincing evidence demonstrates an imminent and specific risk of serious harm, as defined by this Constitution.
Any restriction on land use, agriculture, energy production, or economic activity imposed pursuant to this Article shall be narrowly tailored, proportionate to demonstrated harm, and subject to timely judicial review.

Section 3. No Emergency Power Creation or Pretext

Environmental concerns shall not be invoked to:

a. suspend constitutional rights;
b. bypass legislative authority or ordinary due process;
c. justify permanent emergency powers, executive overreach, or delegation to unaccountable bodies;
d. impose blanket prohibitions or centralize authority beyond demonstrated necessity.
Environmental concerns shall not be used as pretext for fiscal coercion, demographic engineering, suppression of lawful competition, or the permanent expansion of governmental power absent demonstrable and specific harm.
All actions remain subject to full constitutional process, judicial review, and the lock clauses of Article XV.

Section 4. Balance with Human Needs and Property Rights

Stewardship shall be harmonized with and shall not unduly impair:

a. food production, homesteading, and agricultural duty (Article IX);
b. housing, infrastructure, mobility, and energy needs (Article XXIX and related provisions);
c. economic activity essential for human flourishing (Article VIII);
d. private property rights, absent just compensation for any taking.

Preservation shall not become a pretext for deprivation, stagnation, or domination of the People by the State.

Section 5. Remedies and Enforcement

Any person who demonstrates particularized, justiciable injury, including injury arising from provable intergenerational harm that is concrete, material, and supported by evidence, shall have standing to seek judicial relief for violations of this Article.

Remedies may include injunctions, restitution for proven damages, mandatory disclosure of data, or proportional corrective measures consistent with due process.
Standing shall include landholders, farmers, communities, and civic organizations that can demonstrate concrete, material injury supported by evidence.
Willful neglect or abuse of stewardship duties by officials shall constitute an impeachable offense and a violation of oath.


Section 5a. Federalism and Reserved Environmental Powers

States retain primary authority over traditional environmental matters within their borders, including land use, water allocation, and local pollution control, absent express constitutional delegation.

The federal government shall not commandeer state resources, impose regulatory schemes through conditional funding, or coerce state adoption of environmental policies, consistent with Article XXVIII.



Section 6. Construction

This Article shall be interpreted to:

a. favor long-term rational sustainability over short-term extraction or absolutist preservation;
b. prevent ideological or precautionary capture of environmental policy;
c. reject both reckless exploitation and unsubstantiated restriction;
d. bind the State to the same standards of evidence and proportionality it demands of the People;
e. ensure stewardship enhances, rather than undermines, the inviolable rights of the individual.

Section 7. Lock Designation
The following provisions of Article XXXVII are designated as Lock-Protected Provisions and may not be amended, repealed, suspended, or reinterpreted except by the supermajority procedures specified in Article XV:
	•	Section 2 — Evidence Over Narrative (entire section)
Rationale: To permanently prohibit environmental policy justified by ideology, speculative modeling, asserted consensus, or precautionary assumptions absent clear and convincing evidence.
	•	Section 3 — No Emergency Power Creation or Pretext (entire section)
Rationale: To prevent environmental claims from serving as a basis for emergency rule, suspension of rights, or permanent expansion of executive or administrative power.
	•	Section 6(b), (c), and (d) — Construction Safeguards
Rationale: To ensure environmental stewardship remains evidence-based, proportionate, non-ideological, and bound by the same constitutional standards imposed upon the People.
The lock-protected provisions of this Article shall be construed to constrain environmental authority, not to mandate any environmental policy outcome.
All other provisions of Article XXXVII remain amendable in accordance with this Constitution.

ARTICLE XXXVIII — DISASTER RESPONSE AND CIVIL RESILIENCE

Charge

Disaster reveals the true character of a Republic—not in the storm itself, but in how it responds. Flood, fire, earthquake, plague, infrastructure collapse, and mass displacement demand swift coordination and resolve, yet they do not justify tyranny, indefinite emergency, or the suspension of constitutional order.

History teaches that necessity is the plea of tyrants and that “temporary” powers often become permanent when vigilance fails. This Article establishes the Republic’s duty to meet catastrophe with speed, competence, and compassion, while preserving liberty, accountability, and lawful governance. Response shall prioritize life, restore essential services, protect the vulnerable, and return swiftly to normal civil order. No disaster shall become an occasion for constitutional erosion.

Section 1. Duty of Response

The Republic shall maintain the capacity to respond to natural, technological, civil, public health, and other disasters that threaten life, health, essential infrastructure, or public safety.

Disaster response shall prioritize:

a. preservation of human life and dignity;
b. restoration of essential services, including water, power, communications, transportation, and medical care;
c. protection of vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and the infirm;
d. prompt restoration of normal civil order and constitutional governance.

Section 2. Constitutional Continuity

No disaster, emergency, or crisis shall:

a. suspend this Constitution in whole or in part;
b. eliminate or materially impair judicial review;
c. nullify due process or the rights protected under Article XXVI;
d. justify permanent expansion or consolidation of executive, legislative, or administrative authority;
e. permit indefinite derogation from separation of powers, federalism, or individual liberties.

Emergency authority exists to preserve constitutional order, not to replace it.

Section 3. Declaration and Scope of Emergency Authority

A disaster response declaration may be issued by the President for matters of national scope, or by Governors for state or local scope, upon reasonable certainty of imminent grave harm exceeding ordinary response capacity.

Any declaration shall:

a. specify the factual basis for the emergency;
b. define the geographic scope and categories of authority invoked;
c. state an expected duration, subject to constitutional limits;
d. be transmitted promptly to the relevant legislature and made publicly available.

Emergency authority shall be construed narrowly and exercised only to the extent strictly necessary to address the identified harm.

Section 4. Temporary Measures and Automatic Expiration

Extraordinary measures adopted during a declared disaster—including resource mobilization, emergency coordination, or temporary restrictions necessary to prevent imminent loss of life—shall:

a. be narrowly tailored and proportionate to the specific threat;
b. expire automatically after a short, defined period unless affirmatively renewed by the legislature through recorded vote and public justification;
c. remain subject to immediate judicial challenge and expedited review;
d. include just compensation for any taking or requisition of private property.

No emergency measure may be continued once the conditions justifying it no longer exist.

Section 5. Civil Resilience and Subsidiarity

The Republic shall favor civil resilience over centralized control.

Disaster preparedness and response shall prioritize:

a. durable, redundant, and decentralized critical infrastructure;
b. local and state preparedness as the primary line of response;
c. voluntary coordination and mutual aid over coercive compliance;
d. private-sector innovation, charitable action, and community-based response.

Federal intervention shall supplement and support state and local efforts, not supplant them.

Section 6. Oversight, Review, and Accountability

All disaster declarations and emergency measures shall be subject to:

a. legislative oversight, including timely reporting and hearings;
b. judicial review, with standing available to any affected person or state;
c. mandatory after-action review conducted within a reasonable period following termination, assessing necessity, proportionality, effectiveness, and lessons learned.

Intentional abuse, overreach, or continuation of emergency authority beyond constitutional limits constitutes a grave offense. Officials responsible for such violations shall be subject to removal and personal liability in accordance with due process. No immunity shall shield intentional constitutional violations.

Section 7. Construction

This Article shall be interpreted to:

a. enable rapid and effective disaster response without enabling tyranny;
b. reject emergency rule as a permanent condition of governance;
c. preserve liberty, accountability, and constitutional structure during crisis;
d. ensure that resilience strengthens the Republic rather than hollowing it from within.

Section 8. Lock Designation

Pursuant to Article XV, the following principles are designated for lock protection:

a. the prohibition on suspension of the Constitution;
b. the requirement of automatic expiration of emergency authority absent legislative renewal;
c. the preservation of judicial review and standing during emergencies;
d. the prohibition on permanent emergency governance.

Article XXXIX — Right of Access to Public Records and the Public Ministry of Records

Charge

A Republic cannot govern itself in darkness.

Public records are the memory of the State and are held in trust for the People. Where access is delayed, fragmented, selectively disclosed, obscured, or erased, corruption flourishes, accountability collapses, and self-government becomes impossible. History teaches that secrecy is the first refuge of tyrants and the last weapon of parasites.

This Article establishes a constitutional presumption of openness, enforceable rights of access, and durable institutional safeguards to ensure that the memory of the Republic cannot be quietly hidden, distorted, or destroyed.

Section 1. Right of Access and Presumption of Openness

Every person shall have the right to timely and meaningful access to public records.

All records, data, documents, communications, metadata, and other materials created, received, held, or controlled by the Republic, its agencies, officers, or agents acting under color of authority shall be presumed public.

The State bears the burden of demonstrating, by clear and convincing evidence in a court of law, that withholding or redaction is necessary to prevent substantial, specific, and foreseeable harm to a constitutionally protected interest.

Section 2. Narrow and Time-Limited Exemptions

Access may be limited only where disclosure would demonstrably cause substantial harm to one of the following interests:
	•	Personal privacy of living private individuals, excluding public officials acting in their official capacity;
	•	National defense or critical infrastructure, where disclosure would cause identifiable and imminent damage;
	•	Active criminal investigations, where disclosure would endanger life or materially compromise lawful apprehension.

All exemptions shall be narrowly tailored, time-limited, and subject to periodic review. No exemption may persist indefinitely absent renewed justification meeting the standards of this Article.

Section 3. Proactive Disclosure and Default Publication

The Republic shall adopt a system of default openness.

To the maximum extent practicable, non-exempt public records shall be proactively published in accessible, searchable, and machine-readable form, pursuant to law.

Secrecy shall require affirmative justification; silence, delay, or administrative convenience shall not suffice.

Section 4. Public Ministry of Records

A Public Ministry of Records is hereby established as a ministerial steward of public records.

The Ministry shall:
	•	Facilitate access to public records without discretionary gatekeeping;
	•	Maintain and coordinate secure, redundant archival systems to prevent loss, erasure, or single-point capture;
	•	Process access requests pursuant to law and constitutional standards;
	•	House and administer the Civic Metrics Board referenced in Article III-A, including preservation and publication of all civic-metrics data, methodologies, and certification records;
	•	Publish periodic transparency reports detailing aggregate access activity, denials, and redactions.

The Ministry shall operate pursuant to law and be subject to multi-branch oversight, regular audit, and judicial review. It shall possess no authority to classify, suppress, or deny records except as expressly authorized by law and consistent with this Article.

Section 4-A. National Civic Data and Metrics Stewardship

The Public Ministry of Records shall serve as the constitutional steward of national civic, economic, environmental, and quality-of-life data required for the operation of this Constitution.

In furtherance of this duty, the Ministry shall:

(a) collect, standardize, and preserve baseline data necessary to evaluate constitutional thresholds, proportionality tests, and trigger conditions established herein;
(b) publish all datasets, methodologies, models, assumptions, and known limitations in accessible and machine-readable form;
(c) ensure continuity and comparability of metrics across time, administrations, and methodologies;
(d) certify factual determinations as to whether defined constitutional metrics have been met, without recommending policy outcomes.

The Ministry shall possess no authority to direct policy, allocate resources, enforce compliance, or withhold data except as permitted under this Article.

All data and methodologies shall remain subject to public audit, independent replication, and judicial review.

Section 5. Timeliness, Costs, and Non-Obstruction

Access to public records shall be provided promptly and without undue delay, as defined by law consistent with this Article.

Fees shall not be imposed except to recover reasonable and actual costs of duplication. Fees shall not be used to deter, delay, or restrict access.

The Republic shall encourage redundancy, independent preservation, and distributed access as safeguards against capture, destruction, or institutional failure.

Section 5-A. Curricular and Academic Transparency as Public Records

All curricular standards, frameworks, approved instructional materials lists, textbook adoption decisions, accreditation criteria used for public eligibility, educator training guidance issued or funded by the Republic, and all non-exempt communications and rubrics that materially influence public education content shall constitute public records and shall be proactively published in accessible, searchable form.

The Republic and the states shall publish provenance and version history for such materials, including dates of revision, authorship or sponsoring bodies, and stated objectives. The Republic shall not use outsourcing, intermediaries, or private contractors to evade disclosure or to launder policy objectives into “academic” or “professional” guidance without constitutional accountability.

Any person shall have standing to compel disclosure and to challenge non-disclosure, redaction abuse, or procedural delay under this Article.

Section 6. Remedies, Standing, and Accountability

Any person denied access in violation of this Article shall have standing to seek expedited judicial relief.

Courts shall not defer to agency assertions of secrecy but shall independently assess the evidentiary showing required by this Article.

Intentional obstruction, bad-faith delay, destruction, or misclassification of public records shall subject responsible officials to personal liability, removal as provided by law, and other appropriate remedies. No immunity shall shield intentional violations of this right.

Section 7. Preservation and Non-Erasure

No public record shall be destroyed, altered, or retroactively classified for the purpose of evading accountability.

Historical records shall be preserved in accordance with law. Destruction of records may occur only pursuant to lawful retention schedules or judicial order.

The Republic shall not use complexity, procedural delay, or classification creep to defeat the presumption of openness.

Section 7-A. Clarifications on Preserved Materials; Regulated Access

(a) No Destruction-by-Offense or Illegality
Preservation duties under Section 7 apply regardless of whether the material is offensive, unlawful to possess absent authorization, or depicts criminal conduct. The Republic shall not destroy, suppress, or refuse archival lodging solely on that basis.
The Republic may impose lawful seizure, chain-of-custody controls, and evidentiary quarantine to prevent tampering, protect victims, or prosecute crime, but shall preserve the material where preservation remains feasible.

(b) Age-Gating and Context Controls Are Not Censorship
The Republic and the states may restrict access to preserved materials depicting sexual acts, extreme violence, or criminal conduct by age, purpose, and context, including supervised viewing, credentialed research access, restricted facilities, redaction of identifiers, or controlled digital access.
Such restrictions shall not constitute censorship, suppression, or destruction when the Republic preserves the underlying material for lawful review, accountability, scholarship, and historical record, and uses the least restrictive means consistent with protecting minors, victims, and public safety.

Section 7-B. Regulation of Exploitative Commercial Obscenity and Violent Fetish Production

The Republic and the States may regulate or prohibit the commercial production, sale, and distribution of lewd, lascivious, or vulgar material where the production or distribution is exploitative, coercive, materially harmful, or inseparable from criminal conduct. This authority includes material produced by digital fabrication or artificial intelligence where the work is designed to normalize, encourage, or facilitate exploitation, trafficking, sexual violence, or the abuse of children. Any regulation under this Section shall be narrowly tailored, shall state objective elements, and shall not reach noncommercial speech that documents events as they occurred, except as strictly necessary to protect victims and minors.

Section 7-C. Protected Documentation of Crime, Abuse, and Public Corruption

No law shall criminalize the good-faith recording, possession, or publication of audiovisual material for the purpose of documenting crime, abuse of authority, or matters of substantial public concern, where the recorder did not materially participate in planning, soliciting, financing, or directing the underlying criminal act. Recording and publishing an ordinary public disturbance, including a fight, shall remain lawful. Recording a serious crime to expose wrongdoing, including official concealment, shall remain protected, subject to narrowly tailored victim-protection rules.

Material that depicts sexual exploitation of children shall not be publicly distributed. The law shall protect good-faith capture and possession for evidentiary purposes and shall protect prompt submission to law enforcement, courts, or accredited investigative channels under controlled procedures, including protective orders, redaction, and restricted access.

Section 7-D. Preservation, Controlled Access, and Forensic Use of Regulated Material

Any material lawfully seized, surrendered, or obtained as evidence under this Article, including regulated commercial obscene material and exploitative productions, shall be preserved for forensic analysis, crime profiling, and scientific study while it retains evidentiary, investigative, or scientific value. The Ministry of Records shall maintain secure archival custody, with chain-of-custody logging and strict access controls. Access shall be limited by age, credential, purpose, and supervision, and shall use the least restrictive controls consistent with victim protection and public safety.

When such material no longer retains evidentiary, investigative, or scientific value, the law may authorize destruction only by court order after notice, public logging, and certification that destruction will not impair any pending investigation, appeal, or bona fide research need. Destruction under this Section shall never serve ideological convenience, reputational protection, or political interest.

Section 8. Construction

This Article shall be interpreted liberally to favor disclosure, transparency, independent verification, and public accountability.

It shall be read in harmony with Article XXVI (Charter of Inviolable Rights) and enforced as a structural safeguard against secrecy as a mode of governance.

Section 9. Lock Designation

Pursuant to Article XV, the following principles of this Article are designated for lock protection:
	•	the presumption of openness;
	•	the burden on the State to justify secrecy by clear and convincing evidence;
	•	the prohibition on retroactive classification or destruction to evade accountability;
	•	the right of standing to enforce access and challenge obstruction.


Article Iv — The Legislative Branch

Charge

This Article establishes the composition, powers, procedures, limits, and accountability of the Legislative Branch of the Republic.

It defines how laws are proposed, debated, enacted, amended, and repealed, and it sets binding rules to prevent concentration of power, factional capture, secrecy, or circumvention of constitutional authority.

The Legislature exists to exercise lawmaking authority on behalf of the People subject to the supremacy of this Constitution, the rights secured in Article II, and the constraints imposed throughout this Charter.
Section 1. Vesting of Legislative Power

(a) Bicameral Legislature

The legislative power of the Republic is vested in a bicameral Legislature consisting of:
	•	the People’s House; and
	•	the Senate of the States.

No law shall be enacted except by passage through this Legislature or by lawful popular process as provided in this Article.

(b) Subordination to the Constitution and the People

All legislative authority is subordinate to:
	•	this Constitution;
	•	judicial review;
	•	executive veto as provided elsewhere; and
	•	the reserved sovereign powers of the People.

(c) Scope of Legislative Power

The Legislature shall enact laws only within the powers granted by this Constitution.

No statute shall be enacted for private benefit, factional advantage, or personal enrichment.

All legislation shall be enacted through public process, recorded votes, and procedures ensuring transparency, notice, and accountability.

(d) Hybrid Non-Delegation Doctrine

The Legislature may employ departments and experts to assist in administering the laws, but it may not delegate:
	•	the power to make binding rules of general applicability;
	•	the power to impose penalties of general applicability; or
	•	the power to define the scope, meaning, or application of rights.

No regulation, directive, or rule shall carry the force of law unless:
	•	the Legislature has authorized its subject matter;
	•	the Legislature has established clear boundaries within which it may be written; and
	•	the Legislature has approved the final rule, or permitted it to take effect under procedures established by statute that preserve legislative supremacy and judicial review.

(e) Prohibition on Administrative Lawmaking

Agencies may propose regulations, but may not create new obligations, redefine terms, expand authority, or manipulate constitutional meaning beyond limits set by Congress and the Constitution. Attempts to do so constitute constitutional overreach and are void.  Interpretive guidance, rulemaking, advisory opinions, or enforcement standards that effectively create binding obligations or expand statutory scope shall constitute unlawful lawmaking and are void.
(f) Emergency Legislation

In times of war or disaster, Congress may legislate with expedition but shall not abandon constitutional boundaries. Emergency statutes shall contain strict sunset provisions that expire when the emergency expires, and remain subject to judicial review. No emergency grants Congress powers not rooted in this Constitution.

(g) Supermajorities

All constitutional supermajority thresholds in this Article shall be sixty percent (60%) unless another Article expressly provides otherwise.

(h) Rule of Construction

This Section shall be construed to:
1. preserve the exclusive authority of the Legislature to make law;
2. prevent the exercise of legislative power by administrative or private bodies; and
3. enforce strict compliance with the non-delegation and approval requirements set forth herein.
Section 2. The People’s House

(a) Nature and Purpose

The People’s House serves as the primary drafting and deliberative body of the Republic. It exists to:
	•	translate public needs into law;
	•	refine proposals through debate;
	•	ensure constitutional compliance; and
	•	represent population-based civic interests.

(b) Composition and Electorate

Members of the People’s House shall be elected directly by Civic Citizens from population-based districts of approximately equal size, apportioned as provided herein.

(c) Apportionment Base

Apportionment shall be recalculated every ten years. Representation and districting shall count only:
	•	Civic Citizens; and
	•	the minor children of Civic Citizens, each counted as one full unit for apportionment.

Non-civic lawful residents, migrants, refugees, foreign nationals, and unlawful entrants shall not be counted for apportionment or districting.

(d) Non-Integer Apportionment and Minimum Representation

Non-integer apportionment outcomes shall be handled according to established proportional methods used at the time of adoption, as refined by statute. Each State shall receive not less than one seat.

(e) Membership and Odd-Number Requirement

The total number of seats in the People’s House shall always be an odd number. If apportionment yields an even number, one additional seat shall be added by law to preserve an odd total, apportioned under neutral rules consistent with this Constitution.

A default fixed membership of 331 Members may be established by statute as a stable baseline, provided that:
	•	the odd-number rule is preserved;
	•	each State retains a minimum of one seat;
	•	apportionment remains decennial; and
	•	any change to the fixed membership baseline requires a two-thirds (2/3) vote of each House.

(f) Legislative Functions

The People’s House may:
	•	introduce legislation;
	•	amend proposed laws;
	•	initiate appropriations;
	•	conduct investigations;
	•	draft articles of impeachment; and
	•	refer matters to popular vote where authorized.

The House shall not:
	•	exercise executive authority;
	•	appoint executive officers;
	•	command military or police forces; or
	•	insulate legislation from popular review.

(g) Qualifications

To stand for election, a candidate shall:
	•	be a Civic Citizen;
	•	have completed honorable service as required by the citizenship provisions of this Constitution;
	•	possess a record free from corruption, treachery, or grave moral offense;
	•	demonstrate knowledge of the Constitution; and
	•	reside within the district represented at the time of election.

(h) Term Length, Limits, Vacate-Rule, and Total Service Cap
	•	A full term in the People’s House is seven (7) years.
	•	No person may hold a seat in the People’s House for more than twenty-one (21) years total across the entire Legislature, as provided herein.
	•	A person may serve non-consecutive House terms and may seek election in a different district, provided that the Member vacates any House seat for one full term before holding any House seat again.
	•	The twenty-one-year cap is the controlling churn limit across both chambers.

(i) Staggered Elections and Transitional Alignment

Elections to the People’s House shall occur every two (2) years, with seats divided into election classes to ensure continuity and prevent total replacement in a single moment except by lawful recall. Initial transitional alignment and class assignments shall be established by statute.

(j) Election Integrity

Elections to the People’s House shall be free, fair, transparent, auditable, and uniform across the Republic. Foreign influence and partisan manipulation of district lines are prohibited.

(k) Vacancies and Interim Service
	•	States shall determine the process for filling vacancies in House seats and for maintaining the staggering structure, consistent with this Constitution and subject to judicial review for abuse.
	•	Where a special election would break staggering laws or destabilize the election-class system, appointment alone shall stand until the next lawful election window for that seat.
	•	States may appoint an initial representative to fill the interim two-year slot (or other transitional interval) until a regular election can occur consistent with staggering.
	•	Any appointment of less than half a term shall not count toward the twenty-one-year cap.

(l) Ethics and Conduct

Members shall act with humility and integrity. Bribery, foreign enrichment, insider trading, undisclosed compensation, self-dealing, and service to foreign interests are grave offenses, punishable by expulsion and permanent disqualification from office.

(m) Mandatory Direct Voting and Bill Familiarity
	•	Every Member must vote personally and directly. No Member may assign, delegate, or transfer voting power to any surrogate, proxy, or party officer.
	•	Every Member voting on a bill must be sufficiently familiar with the bill to answer questions in committee regarding its purpose, scope, costs, enforcement mechanism, and constitutional authority.
	•	Any systematic violation of this duty constitutes dereliction of office and may be grounds for censure, committee removal, or expulsion under law.

(n) Caucus Limits

Legislative caucuses are permitted only as temporary single-issue bodies.
	•	A caucus must state one issue in its charter.
	•	A caucus dissolves automatically upon resolution of the issue by enactment, defeat, expiration, or withdrawal.
	•	No caucus may persist as a permanent faction, mega-party, or shadow leadership structure.
	•	Parties may exist as election associations, but Congress shall not be governed through permanent caucus-machinery that bypasses transparency and individual accountability.

(o) Interpretation

The People’s House embodies the direct civic will of the Republic, derived from those who have earned citizenship and from the children who are being raised to bear its duties.
(p) Anti-Evasion of Legislative Structure
No chamber, caucus, committee, conference, leadership body, or procedural rule may be structured, renamed, or operated so as to evade, dilute, or reconstitute powers prohibited by this Article.

Internal rules of procedure are subject to constitutional review for compliance with this Article.

Section 3. The Senate of the States

(a) Nature

The Senate is the chamber of State representation within the national Legislature.

It exists to represent States as political units within the federal system and to exercise the powers assigned to it by this Constitution.

(b) Two Senators for Every State

Each State shall have two Senators as follows:
	•	one Senator appointed by the Governor of the State; and
	•	one Senator selected by the State Legislature.

Each Senator possesses one vote. No State may be deprived of representation.

(c) Third Senator Rule for the Most Populous States; Adjustable by Supermajority
	•	The ten most populous States, as determined by the same decennial apportionment used for the People’s House, shall each receive one additional Senator selected by a State Security Consortium.
	•	Congress may expand or contract the number of States eligible for a third Senator only by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of each House.
	•	No change may bypass the constitutional requirement that the Senate and the People’s House remain odd-numbered bodies.

(d) Odd-Number Senate Rule: Additional Senator to the 11th Most Populous State

To render tie votes extraordinarily rare, and to preserve an odd-numbered Senate, when the number of States is even, the eleventh (11th) most populous State shall receive one additional Senator.
	•	This additional Senator shall be selected by sortition from among qualified Civic Citizens of that State under procedures established by law and subject to judicial review.
	•	This Senator serves the same term length, ethics rules, and constitutional duties as all Senators.
	•	This provision is not an at-large seat and shall be tied strictly to the 11th most populous State at each decennial recalculation.

(e) State Security Consortium

The State Security Consortium shall consist of senior representatives chosen internally from:
	•	the State National Guard or military reserve;
	•	State and municipal law enforcement leadership; and
	•	fire, emergency medical, and disaster-response command.

Selection procedures shall:
	•	be transparent;
	•	exclude partisan officeholders;
	•	prohibit federal interference; and
	•	remain subject to judicial review.

(f) Term Length, Limits, Vacancies, and Total Service Cap
	•	A full term in the Senate is seven (7) years.
	•	No person may serve more than two (2) full Senate terms, subject always to the twenty-one-year total cap across the Legislature.
	•	States shall determine the process for filling Senate vacancies, including transitional appointments, consistent with this Constitution and judicial review for abuse.
	•	Any appointment of less than half a term shall not count toward the twenty-one-year cap.

(g) Qualifications

To serve in the Senate, a person shall:
	•	be a Civic Citizen;
	•	have completed honorable service as required by the citizenship provisions of this Constitution;
	•	possess a record free from corruption, treachery, or grave moral offense;
	•	demonstrate wisdom, prudence, and knowledge of constitutional governance; and
	•	maintain residency in the State represented.

(h) Duties and Limitations

The Senate shall:
	•	review, amend, approve, or reject legislation passed by the People’s House;
	•	provide advice and consent on judges and senior officers as defined elsewhere;
	•	ratify or reject treaties and international agreements;
	•	serve as a stabilizing force against tyranny of the majority; and
	•	conduct trials on Articles of Impeachment brought by the People’s House.

The Senate shall not originate legislation except where expressly permitted by this Constitution.

(i) Presiding Officer

The Vice President of the Republic shall serve as President of the Senate and shall cast a vote only in the case of a tie, consistent with the Executive Article. The Senate shall otherwise govern its debate and procedure independently.

(j) Ethics and Conduct

Senators shall maintain the highest standards of integrity and shall not accept bribes, gifts, foreign payments, or advantages for themselves or their families. Corruption is a grave offense and results in expulsion and permanent disqualification.
(k) Eligibility
Eligibility criteria and selection mechanisms under this Section shall be fixed by constitutional rule and may not be altered to advantage any faction, party, or officeholder.
(l) Rule of Construction

This Section shall be construed to:
1. preserve equal State representation as defined herein;
2. enforce the selection, term, and qualification requirements set forth in this Section; and
3. prevent any chamber, State, or officer from altering Senate composition or powers except by constitutional amendment.

Section 4. Legislative Process

(a) Passage of Laws

A bill becomes law only if:
	•	passed by a majority of the People’s House;
	•	passed by a majority of the Senate; and
	•	signed by the President or enacted over veto as provided elsewhere.

(b) Single-Subject Requirement

Every bill shall address only one subject clearly expressed in its title. No bill may contain riders, unrelated provisions, hidden appropriations, or ideological hostage-taking. Budget bills may not be used to enact criminal prohibitions, social policy, or regulatory changes unrelated to revenue and expenditure.

(c) Mandatory Public Notice

No bill may be voted upon unless its full text has been publicly posted for at least seventy-two hours, and every amendment has likewise been posted. Emergency bypass of this posting rule requires a two-thirds vote of each House and written public justification.

(d) Purity of Appropriations

Appropriations shall be single-purpose and confined strictly to the object stated. Hidden appropriations, omnibus packages, and backdoor funding are forbidden.

(e) Mandatory Budget and Essential Pay

Congress shall enact a full and transparent budget annually and may not adjourn for a new session until this duty is fulfilled. Under no circumstances may Congress permit:
	•	the military to go unpaid;
	•	essential personnel to go unpaid; or
	•	national defense to be impaired by failure to enact required appropriations.
Failure to provide these funds constitutes a violation of constitutional duty.
(f) Failure to Act
Failure to enact appropriations as required constitutes actionable constitutional violation subject to remedies under Section 11.

Section 5. Popular Legislative Power

(a) Popular Initiative

The People retain the sovereign right to introduce legislation directly.
	•	Initiation Threshold
A proposed statute shall be docketed upon verified petition signatures from not less than twenty percent (20%) of Civic Citizens nationwide. No geographic minimum shall be required for federal initiatives.
	•	Verification
Signature verification shall include:
	•	a non-invasive biometric identifier approved by statute and consistent with Article II (Informational Self-Determination and Bodily Autonomy); and
	•	a second verification method, such as a license or national digital identification.

Digital media may be used for collection and verification under secure national standards established by law.
	•	Time Window
A petition shall have a defined collection window of one (1) year. A failed petition may be attempted again without limit.
	•	Drafting and Review
Congress shall draft the initiative without adding, deleting, or altering any operative provision, definition, threshold, penalty, or enforcement mechanism except to convert the text into formal statutory language.
	•	Vote and Ballot Method
Initiatives reaching threshold shall be placed on a national ballot and shall pass only by sixty percent (60%) approval of Civic Citizens voting, by paper ballot.
	•	No Turnout Floor and National Voting Access
No turnout floor shall be required. A national day off shall be provided for non-essential labor to ensure voting access, with special provisions for essential employees.
	•	Duration and Renewal
Any initiative enacted by popular vote becomes federal law for ten (10) years. Renewal requires a majority (50%+1) approval by national ballot. Upon renewal, the law becomes permanent statutory law unless and until repealed by the Legislature or the People under this Article. Any effort to convert such a measure into a constitutional amendment must proceed through the amendment article provided elsewhere in this Constitution.

(b) Popular Veto of Legislative Acts

The People retain the sovereign right to veto legislation enacted by Congress.
	•	Petition
Upon verified petition by not less than ten percent (10%) of Civic Citizens within a statutory time period after enactment, the law shall be suspended and submitted to a national ballot.
	•	Vote
The law is void if rejected by sixty percent (60%) of Civic Citizens voting.
	•	Repeat Attempts
The People may attempt veto petitions again without limit, subject only to neutral procedural rules set by law.

(c) Popular Override of Legislative or Executive Blockage

A proposed law rejected by Congress or vetoed by the President may be enacted by the People by:
	•	Sixty percent (60%) national approval by paper ballot; and
	•	full constitutional review by the Supreme Court.

No turnout floor shall exist. Congress shall draft faithfully and may not sabotage the measure by delay, distortion, or insertion. The enacted measure shall follow the ten-year duration and renewal rules of subsection (a)(7).

(d) Limits on Popular Processes

Popular processes may not:
	•	violate enumerated rights;
	•	abolish separation of powers;
	•	establish caste or servitude;
	•	suspend judicial independence;
	•	entrench incumbents or eliminate future elections; or
	•	target individuals or groups by name.

(e) Judicial Safeguards

Courts shall certify procedural validity and constitutional compliance. Courts shall not review political merit or popularity.

Section 6. Transparency and Deliberation

(a) Public Proceedings and Archives

All legislative debates, votes, hearings, committee proceedings, and records shall be public and permanently archived.

(b) Closed Sessions: Narrow National Security Exception Only

Closed sessions may occur only for national security matters whose disclosure would pose a demonstrable and immediate risk to the safety of the nation. Closed sessions require written justification and remain subject to judicial review.

(c) Mandatory Declassification After Twenty-Five Years

All closed-session records shall be disclosed after twenty-five (25) years, unless a court finds that a specific continuing threat still looms. Continued sealing shall be time-limited, narrowly tailored, and periodically re-justified.

(d) Judicially Approved Withholding and the Censorship Test for Government Documents

Any censorship, redaction, withholding, or classification of legislative documents requires judicial approval under a strict test requiring clear and convincing evidence that disclosure would cause direct, immediate, and grave national harm. Withholding must be narrowly tailored, time-limited, and subject to appeal. This provision applies only to government documents and does not restrict private speech.

(e) No Omnibus Deception

No bill may contain unrelated provisions. Each law shall address a single subject.

(f) Real-Time Publication

Congress shall publish in real time:
	•	roll-call votes;
	•	bill texts and amendments;
	•	appropriations and contracts;
	•	committee summaries; and
	•	calendars and schedules.

(g) Whistleblower Protection

Whistleblowers who lawfully disclose corruption, abuse of classification, bribery, or grave public danger shall be protected. Retaliation is a high crime. 
Retaliation against a protected whistleblower constitutes a grave constitutional violation enforceable under this Constitution.

Section 7. Ethics, Corruption, or Discipline

(a) No Self-Dealing

Members shall not trade on insider knowledge, receive undisclosed compensation, serve foreign interests, or benefit personally from legislation.

(b) Prohibition on Lifetime or Inherited Office

No office under this Constitution shall be held for life, inherited, or converted into a permanent entitlement.
(c) Equality of Government Benefits

No law may grant legislators, officers, or their families benefits, exemptions, or protections not equally available to all persons under the same legal conditions. No officer or representative may exempt themselves or their children from conscription, service burdens, or wartime obligations borne by the People.

(d) Discipline for Corruption

Conviction of corruption, bribery, covert foreign enrichment, or grave abuse results in removal, permanent disqualification, and criminal prosecution.

Section 8. Recall, Removal, and Public Oversight
This Section is subject to the scope limitations, continuity requirements, and reconstitution obligations set forth in Article XVI-B.

(a) Recall of Individual Members

Members may be recalled by the People of their district or State under procedures established by State law and consistent with this Constitution and judicial review for abuse.

(b) National Recall of Congress

The People retain the ultimate authority to recall a Congress that has betrayed constitutional duties. 
National recall shall operate only as provided in this Section and shall not alter the regular election cycles, the bicameral structure of Congress, or the constitutional allocation of powers.
	•	Timing Rule
A national recall may occur at any time beginning two (2) years after a national legislative election.
	•	Petition Threshold
A national recall petition requires verified signatures from not less than ten percent (10%) of Civic Citizens nationwide.
	•	Recall Vote
A recall is enacted upon sixty percent (60%) approval by Civic Citizens voting.
	•	Effect
A successful national recall shall:
	•	vacate all seats in one chamber of Congress at a time, as specified in the recall petition;
	•	trigger immediate special elections for vacated House seats or lawful reselection or reappointment of Senators, as applicable;
	•	preserve constitutional continuity by preventing simultaneous dissolution of both chambers; and
	•	require reconstitution of legislative functions without interruption.

Where recall would otherwise eliminate an entire election class in the People’s House, each Governor shall appoint one interim Representative from their State to occupy the next expiring two-year class until the next regular election cycle, in order to preserve staggering and continuity.

No single recall petition or vote may dissolve both chambers of Congress simultaneously.
Implementation must occur within ninety days of certification.
	•	Non-Interference
Congress may enact neutral administrative procedures but may not obstruct, delay, penalize petitioners, or raise thresholds. Any interference constitutes constitutional malfeasance.

(c) Ethics Tribunal and Audits

An independent Congressional Ethics Tribunal shall investigate corruption, bribery, foreign influence, conflicts of interest, abuse of office, manipulation of procedure, and violations of transparency rules, and shall possess subpoena power. Congress shall undergo annual independent audits, with reports published in full.

(d) Independent Prosecution

Crimes committed by Members shall be prosecuted by independent prosecutors under constitutional procedures. No immunity exists for crimes under color of office.

(e) Public Performance Index

A public database shall record attendance, voting records, committee participation, sponsorship of bills, ethical findings, and financial disclosures.

Section 9. Lobbying Courts and Advocacy Rules

(a) Establishment of Lobbying Courts

Independent Lobbying Courts are established as the transparent venue for organized petitions for legislative favor, including requests for:
	•	new laws;
	•	amendments;
	•	regulatory changes;
	•	appropriations;
	•	tax modifications;
	•	trade exceptions; or
	•	any other legislative favor.
Lobbying Courts are transparency and disclosure forums, not criminal or civil courts, and exercise no adjudicative or punitive authority.
Participation does not restrict speech, petition, or advocacy, but conditions legislative access on public disclosure.
(b) Public Record

Proceedings shall be recorded, transcribed, and published within seven days. National security sealing is permitted only for matters that directly threaten the safety of the nation and must be judicially approved and time-limited.

(c) Filing Limits and Equal Access

Each organized petitioner shall be limited to one filing per week and two hours of hearing time, subject to neutral rules. The Courts shall maintain free access for individuals, civic groups, small businesses, and public-interest advocates.

(d) Small and Medium Business Advocate

A designated advocate office shall exist to assist small and medium businesses and other small organizations in navigating the Courts and presenting petitions fairly.

(e) Prohibition on Covert Influence

Outside of duly convened Lobbying Court proceedings, it is unlawful for Members, staffers, executive officers, or agency officials to accept secret payments, meet privately for legislative commitments, or conduct covert negotiations for legislative favors. Violations constitute corruption and grounds for removal and prosecution.

(f) Constituent Communications Preserved

Nothing in this Section prohibits ordinary constituent communication, including calls, letters, meetings in public venues, public forums, and public testimony, for expressing views or urging support or opposition, including lawful threats of recall. Organized requests for special legislative favors remain subject to the Lobbying Courts and transparency rules.

(g) Disclosure Requirements

Petitioners shall disclose funding sources, foreign ties, decision-makers, and beneficiaries. Shell structures to obscure influence are forbidden.

(h) Rule of Construction

This Section shall be construed to require public disclosure, recorded proceedings, and equal access for all petitioners seeking legislative favor, and to prohibit undisclosed, private, or covert legislative influence.
All popular remedies exercised under this Article are subject to the limitations and continuity requirements of Article XVI-B.

Section 10. Congressional Officers and Neutral Governance

(a) Non-Member Speaker of the People’s House

The People’s House shall elect a Speaker who is not a sitting Member of Congress. The Speaker shall be:
	•	a former President of the Republic or a Justice of the Supreme Court, as qualified by law;
	•	a neutral presiding authority;
	•	a non-voting officer; and
	•	responsible for maintaining order and constitutional procedure.

(b) Qualifications Reaffirmed

No person may serve as Speaker unless that person is:
	•	a former President of the Republic or a Justice of the Supreme Court (as specified herein);
	•	a Civic Citizen in good standing; and
	•	free from corruption, treachery, or grave moral offense.

(c) Term of the Speaker

The Speaker shall serve a term of two (2) years, synchronized to the House election cycle, and may be re-elected without limit, provided the Speaker remains qualified and is not a sitting Member of Congress.

(d) Election Timing

The People’s House shall elect the Speaker:
	•	at the first sitting of each newly seated People’s House following the regular House election cycle;
	•	within seven (7) days of a vacancy caused by removal, resignation, death, incapacity, or disqualification; and
	•	upon lawful restoration of Congress after dissolution, recall, or catastrophe.

(e) Election Procedure
	•	Election shall occur by open recorded vote of the People’s House.
	•	A candidate must receive a majority of seated Members to be elected.
	•	If no candidate receives a majority on the first ballot, additional ballots shall be held until a majority is achieved, and no ballot may be conducted by secret vote.
	•	The House may establish neutral procedural rules to manage ballots, provided those rules do not permit partisan officers or caucuses to control the outcome.

(f) Limits on the Speaker

The Speaker may not:
	•	whip votes;
	•	direct legislative outcomes;
	•	bury bills properly introduced;
	•	enforce partisan discipline; or
	•	participate in closed-door legislative bargaining.

The Speaker’s sole voting capacity, if any, shall be limited to administrative matters that do not affect passage or defeat of legislation, and shall be defined narrowly by law.

(g) Interim Presiding Officer

During a vacancy or temporary incapacity of the Speaker, the House Clerk shall preside for ministerial purposes only, including the administration of Speaker elections, and shall possess no authority to schedule, block, or influence legislation.

(h) Removal

The House may remove the Speaker at any time by majority vote. The Speaker may also be removed for corruption or constitutional violation under procedures established by law and judicial review.

(i) Rule of Construction

This Section shall be construed to enforce the neutrality, non-partisanship, and procedural limits of the Speaker as set forth herein.

Section 11. Judicial Remedies for Legislative Failure

(a) Standard of Proof

Judicial enforcement under this Section requires clear and convincing evidence.

(b) Justiciable Duties

The Supreme Court may declare Congress in contempt of the Constitution and order Congress to convene and vote where Congress:
	•	fails to pass a lawful budget;
	•	allows unconstitutional war-making or unconstitutional emergency extensions to persist;
	•	refuses to perform mandatory constitutional duties; or
	•	obstructs constitutionally required transparency.

Judges may review the constitutionality of budgets and may approve or deny judicially requested censorship, redaction, or withholding of government documents under the censorship test described herein. Courts may not control policy discretion, substitute political judgment, or dictate legislative outcomes.

(c) Justiciability Override

Compliance with the duties imposed by this Article constitutes a constitutional obligation, not a political question.

Courts of the Republic shall have jurisdiction to compel compliance with procedural duties herein and may not decline review on grounds of discretion, internal legislative governance, or political question doctrine.

Each chamber retains plenary constitutional authority to structure its officers, and such authority is not limited by historical practice or membership status.

(d) Rule of Construction

This Section shall be construed to authorize judicial enforcement of mandatory constitutional duties set forth in this Article, and to prohibit courts from issuing orders that determine the substantive content of legislation.

Section 12. Non-Delegation and Administrative Restraint

(a) Legislative power shall not be delegated to administrative or executive bodies except for narrowly defined, temporally bounded, and ministerial functions governed by an intelligible principle set forth by statute.

(b) No agency or administrative body may promulgate rules of general applicability carrying the force of law absent explicit and express legislative authorization.

(c) Delegations of authority involving major questions of political, economic, social, or civil consequence—including those with vast economic impact, novel regulatory frameworks, or effects upon fundamental rights—are presumed invalid unless unmistakably authorized by statute.

(d) All delegations of rulemaking authority with legal force shall sunset automatically after five years unless affirmatively reauthorized by law.

(e) Broad, open-ended, implied, or self-extending delegations are void.

Section 13. Government Self-Binding and Equal Application of Law

(a) All laws of general application enacted pursuant to this Constitution shall bind public officials, legislators, judges, executive officers, and governmental entities equally with the public.

(b) No officeholder, agency, or branch of government shall exempt itself from compliance with laws of general application.

(c) Any statute or regulation conferring exemption, immunity, privilege, or special advantage upon public officials or their immediate associates is void.

(d) Changes to compensation, benefits, immunities, or privileges applicable to officeholders shall not take effect until after an intervening election or term of office, as applicable.

(e) Violations of this Section constitute breaches of public trust and may give rise to removal, impeachment, or other lawful sanction.


Section 14. Rule of Construction

This Article shall be construed to:
(a) preserve the bicameral structure and separation of powers established herein;
(b) enforce the procedural, transparency, non-delegation, and anti-capture requirements of this Article;
(c) prevent evasion of legislative limits through procedural manipulation, emergency powers, or administrative proxy; and
(d) ensure that lawmaking authority remains accountable to the People under this Constitution.
Section 15. Article IV Lock Designation and Anti-Evasion Clause

Pursuant to Article XV (Amendments, Lock Clauses, and Anti-Emergency Drift), Article IV — The Legislature is hereby designated as LOCK-PROTECTED.

This designation reflects the deliberate judgment of the People that the legislative power is the most capture-prone authority in any republic and therefore must be constrained by explicit structure, enforceable duty, and judicially reviewable limits.

Section A. Scope of Lock

This Lock applies to the entirety of Article IV, including but not limited to:
	•	the composition, organization, and authority of the Legislature;
	•	limits on delegation, administrative rulemaking, and interpretive authority;
	•	legislative procedures, notice requirements, budgetary duties, and voting obligations;
	•	transparency, declassification, and lobbying disclosure mechanisms;
	•	popular legislative powers, recall provisions, and judicial remedies for legislative failure.

No provision of Article IV shall be repealed, suspended, weakened, narrowed, expanded by implication, or rendered ineffectual except in strict conformity with this Lock Declaration.

Section B. Prohibited Forms of Alteration

The following are expressly prohibited with respect to Article IV:
	•	reclassification of constitutional legislative duties as discretionary, internal, advisory, or non-justiciable;
	•	circumvention of structural limits through internal rules, caucuses, conferences, informal coordination bodies, or renamed procedures;
	•	delegation of lawmaking authority to administrative bodies through interpretation, guidance, enforcement standards, or rulemaking in substance if not in name;
	•	suspension or evasion of legislative obligations by emergency declaration, necessity claims, or institutional convenience;
	•	judicial reinterpretation that restores doctrines of deference, political question abstention, or implied legislative immunity barred by this Constitution.

Any attempt to effect such alteration by statute, regulation, executive action, judicial doctrine, or intergovernmental agreement is void ab initio.

Section C. Permitted Amendments (Narrow Exception)

Amendment to Article IV may occur only for the purpose of:
	•	clarifying internal consistency, definitions, or cross-article coordination without reducing substantive limits or duties;
	•	strengthening transparency, accountability, or enforcement mechanisms;
	•	addressing newly discovered methods of legislative evasion, capture, or procedural laundering.

No amendment may:
	•	expand legislative discretion beyond constitutional bounds;
	•	restore administrative lawmaking authority;
	•	weaken judicial remedies for legislative failure;
	•	diminish popular override or recall mechanisms;
	•	reduce notice, voting, or budgetary obligations.

Section D. Amendment Threshold

Any amendment to Article IV shall require all of the following:
	•	approval by a supermajority of both chambers of the Legislature, as defined in Article XV;
	•	certification by the Supreme Court of the Republic that the amendment does not restore prohibited doctrines, expand legislative immunity, or dilute enforceable duties;
	•	independent review by the Constitutional Judicial Commission (CJC) affirming absence of self-dealing, institutional capture, or procedural manipulation;
	•	ratification by the People, under procedures no less rigorous than those required for original constitutional adoption.

Failure to satisfy any requirement shall invalidate the amendment in its entirety.

Section E. Anti-Backsliding Rule

No amendment, statute, regulation, or judicial interpretation adopted after ratification of this Lock shall be construed to:
	•	convert enforceable legislative duties into discretionary acts;
	•	insulate legislative procedures from constitutional review;
	•	reintroduce administrative lawmaking through indirection;
	•	weaken popular oversight, recall, or transparency mechanisms.

Where conflict exists, Article IV shall control.

Section F. Judicial and Legislative Duty

All courts and legislative bodies of the Republic are bound to:
	•	enforce Article IV as written;
	•	compel compliance with its procedural duties where violated;
	•	resolve ambiguities against expansion of legislative power and in favor of accountability.

Failure by any court, legislator, or legislative officer to honor this Lock constitutes constitutional misconduct.

Section G. Declaration of Legislative Intent

This Lock affirms that legislative power exists to deliberate, decide, and be accountable — not to evade responsibility, delegate authority, or govern by omission.

The People therefore place Article IV beyond erosion by faction, inertia, emergency, or self-interest.


Article XL — Energy, Abundance, and National Resilience

Charge — Article XL: Energy, Abundance, and National Resilience

The modern energy system is a grotesque monument to state capture, cronyism, and deliberate scarcity—a sclerotic regime that feeds on subsidies, smothers innovation with red tape, and condemns the People to high prices, fragility, and dependence. What should be abundant and inexpensive has been rendered artificial and costly by the very governments that claim to protect the public interest.

As Thomas Sowell observed, “The first lesson of economics is scarcity: there is never enough of anything to satisfy all those who want it. The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics.” Modern energy policy exemplifies this error. Real scarcity is ignored while artificial scarcity is imposed—through subsidies that pick winners, regulations that strangle competitors, and emergency powers that entrench failure. Energy poverty is repackaged as virtue; dependence is sold as security.

Ron Paul stated the principle plainly: “The government shouldn’t be in the business of subsidizing any form of energy.” Yet today, vast public resources flow to favored interests—legacy producers, ideological programs, and politically connected intermediaries—while genuine innovators are buried beneath permitting delays, mandates, and compliance mazes. This is not a free market. It is mercantilism under a moral pretext: socialism for the connected, austerity for the public.

Engineers of abundance remind us that reality, not bureaucracy, produces power. As Elon Musk has remarked, the greatest energy source already exists at planetary scale, and progress comes from harnessing what works—not from chasing prestige projects, subsidized illusions, or administratively designed outcomes. Abundance is achieved by aligning with physics, economics, and evidence—not by decree.

Javier Milei has warned of the tools by which states come to dominate society: “With tools such as printing money, debt, subsidies, price controls, and regulations to correct so-called market failures, they can control the lives and fates of millions of individuals.” Energy policy has become one of the most potent of these instruments—used to redistribute wealth upward, enforce dependence downward, and cloak control in the language of necessity.

This Republic rejects the empire of enforced scarcity. It rejects subsidies, mandates, regulatory cartels, and emergency pretexts that convert the lifeblood of civilization into a lever of coercion. Energy abundance is not a luxury; it is the natural outcome of liberty, innovation, competition, and evidence. Anything less is a betrayal of the People and a surrender to administrative rule.

Accordingly, this Article stands as a bulwark: private initiative first; technology neutrality absolute; subsidies forbidden; regulatory obstruction dismantled; and civilization-scale breakthroughs encouraged through voluntary incentives alone. Let markets, not mandarins, deliver the power that sustains freedom. No more excuses. No more chains.

Energy abundance—or decline.


Section 1. Principle of Energy Abundance
 🔒
The Republic recognizes access to reliable, affordable, and sufficient energy as a foundational condition of economic vitality, public welfare, and national security.

Public policy shall favor energy abundance over enforced scarcity, except where temporary restraint is demonstrably necessary to prevent material harm, catastrophic failure, or system collapse.

Energy scarcity imposed by design, ideology, administrative convenience, or regulatory obstruction is forbidden.

Section 2. Primacy of Private Initiative
The production, innovation, ownership, and distribution of energy shall, as a default rule, be open to private individuals, cooperatives, and enterprises operating lawfully within the Republic.

Private energy generation—including decentralized, off-grid, experimental, and self-provisioned systems—is presumptively lawful.

The State shall not monopolize energy production, control pricing or allocation, suppress private innovation, or restrict lawful energy development absent clear and convincing evidence of material harm or systemic risk.

Section 3. Technology Neutrality and Deregulatory Mandate
 🔒
Energy policy shall be:

a. technology-neutral;
b. grounded in empirical evidence, reproducible analysis, and transparent risk assessment;
c. open to continuous innovation, improvement, and replacement.

No energy source—solar, nuclear, fossil, geothermal, synthetic, or novel—shall be prohibited, penalized, subsidized, or favored by ideology, asserted consensus, or political narrative.

Regulatory barriers that materially obstruct private energy development, deployment, or modernization shall be removed unless the State demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that such barriers are necessary to prevent concrete harm.

Section 4. Limited Public Works Authority (Exceptional and Temporary)

Where private provision is demonstrably incapable of meeting essential national needs due to scale, security, or catastrophic vulnerability—and where deregulation alone is insufficient—the Republic may act directly as a measure of last resort.

Any public construction or operation of energy infrastructure shall require:

a. express statutory authorization;
b. written findings of demonstrated necessity;
c. full transparency and audit;
d. automatic sunset not exceeding five (5) years, absent supermajority renewal.

Public energy works shall not crowd out private enterprise, entrench obsolete systems, or persist once private provision becomes feasible.

Section 5. Corps of Engineers and Critical Infrastructure

Congress may authorize the Corps of Engineers or successor public works bodies to design or construct energy infrastructure only where:

a. national defense, disaster resilience, or grid survival so require;
b. failure to act would impose unacceptable risk to life or sovereignty;
c. private actors cannot reasonably perform the work in time or at scale.

Such authority shall be strictly limited, temporary, and shall not include pricing control, permanent operation, or market exclusion.

Section 6. Environmental and Human Balance

Energy development shall be governed consistently with:

a. Article IX (Land, Homesteading, and Agricultural Duty);
b. Article XXXVII (Environmental and Ecological Stewardship);
c. Article VIII (Economic Structure and Stewardship).

Environmental protection shall be evidence-based and proportional, and shall not serve as a pretext for energy deprivation, permanent austerity, or indirect control of the population.

Section 7. Austerity and Emergency Limitations
 🔒

Energy rationing, compulsory reduction, or enforced austerity may occur only where:

a. material scarcity or imminent system collapse is demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence;
b. measures are temporary, narrowly tailored, and judicially reviewable;
c. no less restrictive alternative can reasonably achieve the same protection.

Permanent emergency framing of energy governance is prohibited.

Section 8. Breakthrough Energy: Incentives, Disclosure, and Sunset

Where a method of energy generation is demonstrated to be civilization-scale in impact—capable of materially eliminating energy scarcity through abundance—the Republic shall encourage its disclosure and deployment through voluntary incentives rather than compulsion.

Congress may provide for statutory frameworks that:

a. offer substantial prizes, bounties, or guaranteed public procurement contracts for disclosure and deployment;
b. encourage voluntary licensing on fair and reasonable terms;
c. protect inventors against suppression, sabotage, or foreign capture.

Any such framework shall be evidence-based, non-punitive, and non-coercive, and may include:

d. optional shortened periods of exclusive rights;
e. optional post-recoupment licensing incentives, triggered only after demonstrable recovery of development costs and reasonable profit;
f. eventual public-domain release after defined temporal or economic thresholds, where continued exclusivity no longer serves innovation or public benefit.

No individual or entity shall be compelled to deploy, license, or surrender energy technology absent voluntary agreement or judicial finding of fraud, suppression, or unlawful restraint of trade.

Section 9. Anti-Subsidy and Anti-Cronyism Rule
 🔒

No subsidies, tax preferences, loan guarantees, or preferential financing shall be granted to any energy source or producer.

Public funds may be used only for neutral prizes, open procurement, or temporary public works authorized under Sections 4 or 5.

Cronyism, capture, and artificial market distortion are forbidden.

Section 10. Construction

This Article shall be interpreted to:

a. favor abundance, resilience, and innovation over scarcity and stagnation;
b. preserve maximum private liberty consistent with national survival;
c. reject ideological or technocratic capture of energy policy;
d. bind the State to the same standards of evidence, proportionality, and restraint imposed upon the People;
e. permit any person or enterprise with standing to challenge regulatory obstruction, unreasonable delay, or denial of lawful energy development as a form of artificial scarcity, subject to evidentiary standards and judicial review consistent with this Constitution.

Pursuant to Article XV, the following provisions of Article XL — Energy, Abundance, and National Resilience are hereby designated Lock-Protected Provisions. These provisions may not be amended, repealed, suspended, or reinterpreted except by the supermajority and procedural safeguards specified in Article XV.

🔒 
Article XL — Lock-Protected Provisions
	•	Section 1 — Principle of Energy Abundance 🔒
Rationale:
To permanently prohibit enforced energy scarcity, austerity by design, ideological deprivation, and regulatory obstruction of energy essential to liberty, prosperity, and national survival.
	•	Section 3 — Technology Neutrality and Deregulatory Mandate 🔒
Rationale:
To constitutionally forbid ideological favoritism, narrative-based energy policy, and regulatory suppression of lawful private energy development absent clear and convincing evidence of concrete harm.
	•	Section 7 — Austerity and Emergency Limitations 🔒
Rationale:
To prevent energy emergencies from becoming permanent governance regimes or instruments of coercive control.
	•	Section 9 — Anti-Subsidy and Anti-Cronyism Rule 🔒
Rationale:

All other provisions of Article XL remain amendable under ordinary constitutional procedures and are expressly excluded from lock protection.


Article XLI — Patents, Knowledge, and the Public Commons

Charge

The modern intellectual property regime has become a bloated instrument of rent-seeking and stagnation—patent thickets that entrench incumbents, evergreening that delays competition, and endless litigation that rewards lawyers over inventors. What began as a tool to reward disclosure and risk has too often morphed into permanent monopolies that bury knowledge, raise prices, and slow progress.

Yet the core idea—temporary, disclosure-based privileges to encourage creation and investment—has merit. As Ayn Rand argued, the law may recognize the contribution of the mind by granting a limited window to recoup costs and profit from original effort, provided the knowledge is fully disclosed for others to build upon.

Thomas Sowell reminds us that politics disregards scarcity—and when it comes to non-scarce ideas, politicians and cronies have imposed artificial scarcity to favor the connected. Elon Musk exposed the system’s flaws by open-sourcing Tesla’s patents, demonstrating that innovation often thrives on speed, talent, and openness rather than government-granted monopolies. Even critics such as Stephan Kinsella, who reject intellectual property outright, highlight how the present system distorts markets and punishes peaceful imitation. Javier Milei’s attack on state-granted privileges echoes the same truth: artificial barriers that entrench power must fall.

This Republic rejects perpetual enclosure and suppression. Intellectual property is a limited tool—not a natural right, not eternal, and not a license to hoard. It exists to incentivize disclosure and reward risk, then yields to the public commons. Creators shall receive real, time-bound protection; the People shall inherit the knowledge that advances civilization.

Innovation belongs to those who create and share, not those who litigate and lobby. The future is built on open progress—guarded incentives, not ironclad monopolies.

Section 1. Principle of Instrumental Intellectual Property

Intellectual property, including patents and related exclusive rights, is not a natural right inherent to persons or entities.

Such rights exist solely as temporary legal privileges, granted by the Republic for the limited purpose of encouraging disclosure, innovation, investment, and the advancement of knowledge for the eventual benefit of the People.

No grant of intellectual property shall be construed as perpetual, absolute, or immune from limitation, convergence, or termination in the public interest, as governed by this Constitution.

Section 2. Disclosure as the Condition of Protection

Exclusive intellectual property protection shall be conditioned upon full, truthful, and sufficient public disclosure of the protected invention, method, or process.

No person or entity may simultaneously claim exclusive rights while withholding, obscuring, fragmenting, or strategically concealing essential information necessary for understanding, replication, evaluation, or future improvement of the protected subject matter.

All disclosures required under this Article are incorporated within and subject to the archival, access, preservation, and anti-suppression duties established in Article X (Knowledge, Technology, and the Digital Commons).

Failure to disclose as required shall render any claimed exclusivity voidable or unenforceable, subject to judicial determination.

Section 3. Duration, Recoupment, and Convergence

Exclusive intellectual property protections shall be limited in duration and structured to permit reasonable opportunity for recoupment of development costs and profit, without enabling permanent control, hoarding, or suppression of knowledge.

Congress may establish statutory frameworks that:

a. define finite periods of exclusivity proportionate to the nature, risk, and cost of development;
b. recognize earlier convergence where public funding, civilization-scale impact, or rapid cost recovery is demonstrated;
c. provide for voluntary licensing incentives following recoupment of reasonable investment and profit;
d. ensure that, upon expiration or termination, protected knowledge transitions into the public commons.

All intellectual property granted under this Article remains subject to the mandatory convergence, preservation, and public-access provisions of Article X, including acceleration or termination upon abandonment, dissolution, suppression, or abuse.

No alteration of exclusivity shall apply retroactively to vested grants absent just compensation or voluntary assent.

Section 4. Archival Preservation and Knowledge Continuity

All inventions, processes, methods, schematics, source materials, and supporting documentation disclosed pursuant to this Article shall be preserved in a secure, durable, and publicly accountable archival system, as governed by Article X (Knowledge, Technology, and the Digital Commons).

Such preservation shall ensure:

a. long-term integrity, accessibility, and readability;
b. protection against loss, destruction, manipulation, or strategic disappearance;
c. continuity of knowledge across generations, institutions, and technological transitions.

No grant of intellectual property shall exempt the holder from archival obligations imposed by Article X.

Section 5. Suppression, Shelving, and Abuse of Privilege

Intellectual property privileges shall not be used to suppress, bury, delay, or strategically withhold knowledge whose disclosure would materially advance scientific understanding, public welfare, or civilizational capacity.

Abuse of privilege includes, but is not limited to:

a. acquisition of exclusive rights for the primary purpose of non-use or delay;
b. defensive patenting intended to prevent deployment or competition without bona fide development;
c. fragmentation of disclosures to obscure functional understanding;
d. contractual or licensing schemes designed to evade convergence to the public commons.

Findings of suppression or abuse under this Article shall require clear and convincing evidence and may result in limitation, termination, or acceleration of convergence, consistent with Article X enforcement standards and subject to judicial review.

Any person or enterprise with standing may seek judicial relief against suppression, shelving, or abuse of intellectual property privileges, subject to evidentiary standards consistent with this Constitution.

Section 6. Patent Office Stewardship and Anti-Capture Constraints

The Patent Office or successor authority shall function solely as a registrar, archivist, and steward of disclosure, and not as a gatekeeper of innovation, industrial policy actor, or market participant.

Its duties shall be limited to:

a. registering disclosures and claims of exclusivity;
b. ensuring compliance with disclosure and archival requirements;
c. recording statutory triggers for expiration, convergence, or termination.

The Patent Office shall be subject to strict transparency, conflict-of-interest, and anti-capture rules, consistent with Articles X and XI, and shall not exercise discretionary authority to favor, suppress, delay, or condition innovation beyond mechanical compliance with law.

Section 7. Public Funding, Research, and Accelerated Convergence

Where research, development, or innovation is funded in whole or in part by public resources, any resulting intellectual property shall be subject to accelerated convergence to the public commons.

Congress may provide by law that publicly funded or publicly commissioned innovations:

a. receive reduced periods of exclusivity;
b. require broader disclosure obligations at earlier stages;
c. transition to the public commons upon recoupment of reasonable private investment, where applicable.

Public funding shall not be used to create permanent monopolies, proprietary choke points, or exclusive control over knowledge whose development was materially supported by the People.

No alteration of exclusivity arising under this Section shall apply retroactively to vested grants absent just compensation or voluntary assent.

Section 8. Public Records, Access, and Auditability

All intellectual property disclosures, registrations, archival materials, and convergence determinations under this Article shall constitute public records, subject to access, inspection, and audit consistent with Article XXXIX (Records Access) and Article X (Knowledge, Technology, and the Digital Commons).

Limitations on access may be permitted only where narrowly necessary to protect:

a. legitimate national security interests;
b. personal privacy unrelated to the protected subject matter;
c. temporary competitive confidentiality expressly authorized by law.

Such limitations shall be construed narrowly and shall not be used to conceal suppression, abuse, capture, or evasion of convergence.

Section 9. Construction

This Article shall be interpreted to:

a. favor disclosure, competition, and innovation over secrecy and rent-seeking;
b. ensure that intellectual property serves the public good rather than private enclosure;
c. prevent permanent monopolization or suppression of civilization-advancing knowledge;
d. preserve incentives for creation while guaranteeing eventual convergence to the public commons;
e. permit private parties with standing to enforce the prohibitions of this Article through judicial process;
f. operate in harmony with Articles X, XI, and XXXIX, which govern knowledge stewardship, anti-capture safeguards, and public records.

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to require the continuation of any intellectual property regime beyond such time as the People, through their representatives, determine that such privileges are no longer necessary to incentivize innovation.

Article XLI — Lock-Protected Provisions

(Pursuant to Article XV)

Pursuant to Article XV (Amendment and Lock Clauses), the following provisions of Article XLI — Patents, Knowledge, and the Public Commons are hereby designated Lock-Protected Provisions. These provisions may not be amended, repealed, suspended, or reinterpreted except by the supermajority procedures and safeguards specified in Article XV.

🔒 
Section 1 — Principle of Instrumental Intellectual Property

Lock Scope: Entire Section.

Rationale:
To permanently affirm that intellectual property is a temporary legal privilege granted for public benefit, not a natural, inherent, or perpetual right, and to foreclose constitutional reinterpretation treating ideas, discoveries, or methods as homesteadable property.

🔒 
Section 2 — Disclosure as the Condition of Protection

Lock Scope: Entire Section.

Rationale:
To constitutionally require full, truthful, and sufficient disclosure as the price of exclusivity, preventing secrecy, fragmentation, concealment, or strategic obscuring of knowledge under color of monopoly.

🔒 
Principle of Inevitable Convergence to the Public Commons

Lock Scope:
The governing principle derived from Sections 3, 5, and 7, that all intellectual property protections are temporary and must ultimately terminate or converge into the public commons.

Rationale:
To permanently prohibit eternal enclosure of civilization-advancing knowledge and to ensure that intellectual property privileges serve innovation only for a limited time before yielding to public access and use.

🔒 
Section 5 — Prohibition on Suppression, Shelving, and Abuse of Privilege

Lock Scope: Entire Section.

Rationale:
To permanently forbid the use of intellectual property privileges to suppress, bury, delay, shelve, or strategically withhold knowledge for anti-competitive, coercive, or rent-seeking purposes, subject to evidentiary standards and judicial review.

🔒 
Right of Standing for Enforcement

Lock Scope:
The provisions establishing standing for private parties to seek judicial relief against suppression, shelving, abuse, or evasion of convergence, as set forth in Sections 5 and 9.

Rationale:
To guarantee enforceability through judicial process and prevent institutional capture, agency paralysis, or selective non-enforcement of constitutional knowledge protections.

🔒 
Non-Entrenchment of Intellectual Property Regimes

Lock Scope:
The final sentence of Section 9, providing that no intellectual property regime is constitutionally required to persist indefinitely.

Rationale:
To clarify that this Constitution does not mandate the permanent existence of any patent or intellectual property system and preserves the authority of the People, through their representatives, to abolish or replace such regimes where incentives are no longer necessary.


Article XLII — Freedom of Communication

Charge
The modern censorship regime is tyranny in digital form: surveillance that chills speech, compelled platform control that launders censorship through intermediaries, and pretextual regulation—invoking safety, democracy, or stability—to govern discourse rather than conduct.

When the State claims authority over truth, liberty collapses. Mass surveillance breeds self-censorship; compelled moderation converts private platforms into instruments of control; and “misinformation” becomes a weapon to silence dissent instead of confront error.

Free societies depend on the ability of individuals to speak, listen, assemble, and associate without permission. Encrypted and anonymous communication is not a threat to self-government; it is a prerequisite for it.

This Republic rejects prior restraint, compelled mediation, mass surveillance, and encryption sabotage. Criminal acts may be punished, but communication itself shall not be pre-emptively governed, filtered, or coerced. Let the People speak, listen, organize, and decide—freely and without fear.

Section 1. Broad Protection of Communication

No law shall abridge the freedom of speech, expression, press, assembly, petition, or any form of communication, including electronic, encrypted, anonymous, or broadcast forms, whether public or private.

These protections apply regardless of medium, technology, platform, or method of transmission, present or future.

Section 2. No Prior Restraint; No Compelled Mediation

Prior restraint on communication is prohibited.

No person, platform, network, or intermediary shall be compelled to censor, moderate, amplify, demote, label, or otherwise mediate content absent a specific judicial order addressing proven, particularized harm attributable to identified actors.

General mandates, algorithmic filtering, or blanket content controls are forbidden.

Section 3. Encryption, Anonymity, and Private Association

The right to private, encrypted communication and anonymous expression is inviolable.

No law shall require encryption backdoors, key escrow, mandatory identification to speak, real-name requirements, or systemic weakening of privacy or security for the general public.

The State shall not condition access to communication networks on identity disclosure or viewpoint compliance.

Section 4. Surveillance Limits

Mass, bulk, or warrantless surveillance of communications is prohibited.

Targeted surveillance may occur only pursuant to a judicial warrant based on probable cause of a specific crime, describing with particularity the person, scope, and duration. Surveillance based on thought, belief, association, or lawful expression is forbidden.

Section 5. Platform Neutrality and State Action

Private platforms may set their own terms and exercise editorial discretion.

However, when a platform functions as a common carrier, receives material government compulsion or direction, or acts in concert with the State, it shall not discriminate or impose restrictions based on viewpoint, lawful political content, or identity.

The State may not evade this Article by outsourcing censorship, moderation, or surveillance to private actors.

The State shall not grant, condition, revoke, or threaten immunity, liability protection, regulatory forbearance, funding, or preferential treatment based on a platform’s willingness to censor, surveil, or moderate lawful communication on behalf of the State.

Section 6. Narrow Carveouts for Criminal Harm (Strictly Limited)

Nothing in this Article prevents post-facto enforcement against criminal acts committed through communication, provided that all safeguards below are met:

(a) Imminent, Specific Harm

Intervention is permitted only to address direct incitement, true threats, or coordination of imminent lawless action toward identifiable victims, supported by clear and convincing evidence, and subject to judicial order or immediate judicial review.

(b) Crimes Against Children

Material constituting evidence of child exploitation may be investigated and prosecuted as criminal conduct, not as protected expression, without mandating general-purpose scanning, platform-wide monitoring, or the weakening of encryption, anonymity, or security for the general public. Enforcement shall proceed only through targeted warrants, individualized investigations, and judicially supervised process.

(c) Fraud, Coercion, and Criminal Conspiracy

Speech integral to fraud, extortion, trafficking, or criminal conspiracy may be prosecuted after the fact based on acts and intent, without prior restraint or generalized monitoring.

Section 7. Prohibited Pretexts

The following shall never justify restraint, surveillance, or compelled mediation of communication:
	•	Claims of “misinformation” or “disinformation” absent specific criminal acts;
	•	“Hate” or offensive expression absent direct, imminent threats;
	•	Public order, democratic stability, foreign influence, or ideological harm;
	•	Health, safety, or national security narratives lacking individualized warrants and evidence.
Section 7B. Prohibition on Speech-Crimes of Mere Dissent

(a) Core Rule.
No law shall criminalize, penalize, or create civil disability for speech or expressive conduct solely because it:
    1. criticizes, condemns, mocks, or satirizes the Republic, a State, any public institution, any public officer, any political party, or any public policy;
    2. disputes official narratives, official statistics, official communications, or claims of governmental legitimacy, competence, or morality; or
    3. expresses opposition to war, military action, foreign policy, policing, taxation, regulation, or any other exercise of public power.

(b) Forbidden Labels and Vagueness.
No person shall be prosecuted or punished under vague, elastic, or status-based speech categories, including “discrediting,” “fake news,” “harmful misinformation,” “anti-state propaganda,” “extremism,” “radicalization,” “hate,” or similar labels, unless the State proves each element of a defined criminal offense with particularity under subsection (c).

(c) Narrow Exception for Direct Criminal Instrumentality.
Speech may be restricted or punished only where the government proves, by clear and convincing evidence:
    1. specific intent (mens rea) to cause or materially facilitate a defined criminal act;
    2. a direct and proximate causal connection between the expression and that criminal act; and
    3. imminence and likelihood of the criminal act, not speculative or generalized risk.
Mere falsity, error, controversial opinion, moral offense, institutional embarrassment, or political inconvenience shall never suffice.

(d) Prior Restraint and Orders.
No injunction, censorship order, compelled deletion, compelled labeling, or compelled mediation may issue against lawful political communication. Any order targeting specific expression shall be narrowly tailored to prevent a proven, particularized criminal act, and shall state written findings on intent, imminence, and causation.

(e) Construction.
Ambiguities in speech-restricting laws shall be construed against the State. The burden rests on the State to prove the narrow exception; the presumption favors free expression.
This subsection does not bar prosecution of underlying crimes; it bars punishment based on label absent proof of defined criminal elements.

Section 7C. Prohibition on “Foreign Agent” and “Undesirable” Stigma Regimes

(a) Core Rule.
No person, association, publisher, platform, charity, newsroom, academic institution, or civic organization shall be designated, labeled, registered, or burdened as a “foreign agent,” “foreign-influenced,” “undesirable,” “enemy of the people,” or similar stigmatizing status by reason of foreign contact, foreign funding, cross-border affiliation, international speech, or political viewpoint.

(b) Due Process Threshold.
The State may impose narrowly tailored disclosure or registration duties only upon conviction (after trial and appeal) for a specific crime involving:
    1. espionage; or
    2. knowing direction or operational control by a foreign state in the commission of defined criminal acts.
Financial support, donations, grants, or association alone shall not satisfy this threshold absent proof of knowing criminal coordination.

(c) No Compelled Disclaimers; No Forced Self-Denunciation.
The State shall not compel any person or entity to append government-scripted labels, disclaimers, warnings, or “agent” markings to lawful speech, publications, websites, broadcasts, or communications. The State shall not require routine public self-identification that predictably chills lawful political participation.

(d) No Administrative Suppression by Designation.
No designation, listing, or administrative finding may be used to deny banking, payment rails, hosting, domain services, employment, licensing, education access, permits, or access to public venues for lawful speech and association, absent conviction for a defined crime and individualized judicial findings of necessity.

(e) Remedies and Oversight.
Any person subject to attempted designation or compelled labeling under this Section shall have immediate standing for expedited injunctive relief. Courts shall presume irreparable harm from compelled stigma or chilled political speech.

Section 8. Remedies and Standing

Any person or entity with standing may seek judicial relief for violations of this Article. Courts shall provide expedited review and effective remedies, including injunctive relief and suppression of unlawfully obtained evidence.

Section 9. Construction

This Article shall be interpreted to favor maximum freedom of communication, least-restrictive means, and individualized, judicially supervised enforcement. It shall be read in harmony with Article XXVI (Charter of Inviolable Rights) and shall not be suspended by emergency declaration, administrative necessity, or indirect coercion.

Section 10. Lock-Protected Provisions

Pursuant to Article XV (Amendment and Lock Clauses), the following provisions of Article XLII — Freedom of Communication are designated Lock-Protected Provisions. No law, regulation, emergency order, administrative act, or judicial reinterpretation shall amend, repeal, suspend, derogate from, or narrow these provisions except through the supermajority procedures and safeguards specified in Article XV.

1. Section 1 — Broad Protection of Communication
Lock Scope: Entire Section.
Rationale: To permanently secure the freedom of speech, expression, press, assembly, petition, and all forms of communication, including electronic, encrypted, anonymous, and broadcast forms, against abridgment by statute, regulation, technological control, or administrative practice.

2. Section 2 — No Prior Restraint; No Compelled Mediation
Lock Scope: Entire Section.
Rationale: To permanently prohibit prior restraint and compelled censorship, moderation, amplification, demotion, labeling, or mediation of lawful communication, except pursuant to specific judicial orders addressing proven, particularized criminal harm.

3. Section 3 — Encryption, Anonymity, and Private Association
Lock Scope: Entire Section.
Rationale: To permanently protect the right to private, encrypted, and anonymous communication and association, and to forbid encryption backdoors, key escrow, mandatory identification to speak, real-name requirements, or systemic weakening of privacy and security for the general public.

4. Section 7 — Prohibited Pretexts
Lock Scope: Entire Section.
Rationale: To permanently bar censorship, surveillance, compelled mediation, or indirect suppression justified by generalized or pretextual claims, including misinformation, hate, public order, democratic stability, foreign influence, health, or national security, absent individualized criminal acts supported by evidence and judicial process.

5. Section 7B — Prohibition on Speech-Crimes of Mere Dissent
Lock Scope: Entire Section.
Rationale: To permanently forbid criminalization, penalty, or civil disability for speech based solely on dissent, criticism, or dispute of official narratives, and to prevent vague speech-crime labels from substituting for defined criminal elements.

6. Section 7C — Prohibition on “Foreign Agent” and “Undesirable” Stigma Regimes
Lock Scope: Entire Section.
Rationale: To permanently forbid compelled stigma, registration, or administrative suppression of lawful speakers and organizations based on foreign contact, funding, or viewpoint, and to prevent designation-based denial of essential services absent conviction for defined crimes with full due process.
Article XLII-A — Communications Infrastructure and Civic Network Neutrality

Section 1. Purpose and Relationship to Article XLII

This Article governs the infrastructure, transmission, and technical conveyance of communications.
It exists to ensure that the freedom protected by Article XLII cannot be defeated through economic throttling, technical discrimination, or infrastructural capture.

Where conflict is alleged, Article XLII shall control as to expressive rights, and this Article shall control as to transport, access, and neutrality.

⸻

Section 2. Civic Communications Infrastructure

Communications infrastructure essential to civic participation—including wired, wireless, satellite, and successor technologies—shall be recognized as critical civic infrastructure, whether publicly or privately operated.

Such infrastructure shall be operated in a manner consistent with:
	1.	neutrality,
	2.	nondiscrimination,
	3.	transparency,
	4.	resilience,
	5.	universal access to the extent practicable.

Ownership structure shall not exempt compliance.

⸻

Section 3. Network Neutrality

No operator of communications infrastructure shall:
	1.	block, throttle, degrade, or prioritize lawful data traffic based on:
	•	content,
	•	source,
	•	destination,
	•	viewpoint,
	•	application type,
	•	or affiliation;
	2.	impose discriminatory pricing, latency, or access conditions that materially impair civic participation;
	3.	condition service quality on political, ideological, or commercial alignment.

Differential treatment is permitted only where:
	•	strictly necessary for network integrity,
	•	content-agnostic,
	•	narrowly tailored,
	•	and publicly disclosed.

⸻

Section 4. Measurement, Transparency, and Proof

Operators shall maintain objective, verifiable performance metrics, including latency, throughput, packet loss, and availability.

Where discrimination is alleged:
	1.	statistical disparity and technical evidence shall suffice to shift the burden of proof;
	2.	intent need not be shown where effect is substantial;
	3.	failure to disclose metrics creates a rebuttable presumption of violation.

⸻

Section 5. Economic Neutrality and Anti-Capture

No entity may:
	1.	use market dominance to impose de facto censorship through access degradation;
	2.	leverage infrastructure control to extract political, ideological, or behavioral concessions;
	3.	collude with public or private actors to suppress lawful communication indirectly.

Structural separation, common-carrier obligations, or access mandates may be imposed by law where necessary to prevent capture.

⸻

Section 6. Civic Access and Inclusion

The State shall ensure that communications infrastructure policy:
	1.	promotes universal civic access;
	2.	avoids exclusion by cost, geography, or artificial scarcity;
	3.	supports redundancy and decentralization;
	4.	preserves interoperability and open standards.

Nothing herein requires uniform pricing or forbids innovation, provided neutrality is preserved.

⸻

Section 7. Emergency and Security Exceptions

Temporary deviations from neutrality are permitted only where:
	1.	strictly necessary to preserve network integrity or public safety;
	2.	limited in duration and scope;
	3.	publicly documented;
	4.	subject to post-event judicial review.

Emergency powers shall not be used to suppress lawful expression or political communication.

⸻

Section 8. Enforcement and Remedies

Violations of this Article shall constitute a grave civic offense.

Remedies may include:
	1.	injunctive relief;
	2.	civil liability;
	3.	structural remedies;
	4.	loss of operating privileges;
	5.	criminal liability where willful and systemic.

Standing shall be broad, and no immunity shall attach by virtue of infrastructure ownership or regulatory delegation.

⸻

Section 9. Technological Neutrality

This Article applies to all present and future communications technologies, regardless of medium, protocol, or architecture.

Regulation shall be function-based, not platform-based, and shall adapt to technological evolution without undermining constitutional principles.

⸻

Section 10. Construction and Lock Scope

This Article shall be construed:
	•	to prevent infrastructural censorship by design,
	•	to preserve competition and innovation,
	•	to protect civic participation at scale.

The principles of neutrality, nondiscrimination, transparency, and universal civic access are structurally locked.
Operational mechanisms remain subject to legislative refinement consistent with this Constitution.

⸻

Section 11. Severability

If any provision of this Article is held invalid, the remainder shall remain in force.

⸻
Article XLIII — Civil Service Corps

Charge

The People affirm that civic authority must be earned through real sacrifice, not abstract qualification, inheritance, or administrative convenience. Where the Republic conditions political sovereignty upon service, it must ensure that qualifying service pathways remain genuinely available, arduous, and immune to quiet erosion.

This Article exists to preserve the integrity, accessibility, and rigor of certain essential civic service pathways, not to create entitlement, employment, or bureaucracy.

⸻

Section 1. Establishment and Purpose

A Civil Service Corps is hereby established solely for the purpose of providing limited, constitutionally compliant civic service pathways consistent with Article III — Citizenship and Civic Duty.

The Civil Service Corps shall exist as a structural safeguard, ensuring that the Republic maintains a minimum availability of qualifying service opportunities that cannot be eliminated, privatized, credential-substituted, or rendered illusory through legislative neglect, administrative drift, or emergency pretext.

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to expand eligibility for Civic Citizenship beyond the requirements of Article III.

⸻

Section 2. Nature and Limits of the Corps

Service within the Civil Service Corps:

(a) shall be voluntary in initiation and binding once undertaken;
(b) shall be labor-intensive, physically demanding, publicly accountable, and oriented toward hardship, danger, sustained effort, or exposure;
(c) shall not consist of clerical, advisory, managerial, academic, symbolic, or credential-based roles;
(d) shall not be converted into training programs, resume-building exercises, or administrative placements;
(e) shall not be delegated to private contractors in a manner that reduces hardship or public accountability.
(f) Qualifying service must produce independent, external, and measurable public benefit beyond the participant’s own experience, demonstration, or symbolic act.

The Corps shall not function as a general workforce, welfare program, employment guarantee, or substitute for ordinary public employment.

⸻

Section 3. Qualifying Service Categories (Minimum Floor)

The Republic shall ensure the continued availability of a limited number of service positions within categories that include, but are not limited to:

(a) public infrastructure construction, repair, and maintenance in hazardous or austere conditions;
(b) disaster response, recovery, debris removal, and environmental remediation involving physical risk or sustained hardship;
(c) recovery, preservation, and physical restoration of public records, archives, and critical civic assets under adverse conditions;
(d) other labor-intensive public works essential to the Republic’s continuity that meet or exceed the hardship standards of Article III.
(e) Where technological advancement, automation, or private deployment materially reduces or eliminates hardship, danger, or public exposure in otherwise qualifying civic service domains, the Republic shall maintain or create alternative service roles that impose equal or greater levels of physical, psychological, or environmental hardship, rather than eliminating civic service pathways.

No category shall qualify unless service within it imposes real, unavoidable sacrifice comparable to other qualifying civic service avenues.

⸻

Section 4. Duration and Exclusivity

Service within the Civil Service Corps shall require five (5) continuous years of honorable completion, consistent with the non-combat baseline established in Article III.

No individual may qualify for Civic Citizenship through repeated, stacked, abbreviated, or segmented service terms within the Corps.

Service in the Corps may be used to satisfy civic service requirements only once and shall not be transferable, inheritable, purchasable, or delegable.

⸻

Section 5. Caps and Anti-Dilution Safeguards

Enrollment in the Civil Service Corps shall be numerically capped by law to prevent:

(a) mass production of Civic Citizenship;
(b) demographic engineering or political manipulation;
(c) economic dilution of labor markets;
(d) displacement of other qualifying service pathways.

Caps shall be set conservatively and may not be expanded absent clear evidence that qualifying service pathways have otherwise become unavailable.

No emergency, necessity claim, or administrative discretion may be used to waive caps, reduce hardship, shorten duration, or substitute credential-based evaluation for actual service.

⸻

Section 6. Administration and Oversight

The Corps shall be administered by public authorities subject to transparency, audit, and judicial review.

No administrative body may redefine qualifying service standards, reclassify roles to reduce hardship, or impose requirements beyond those expressly authorized by this Constitution.

Courts shall construe ambiguities against dilution of service rigor and in favor of preserving Article III integrity.

⸻

Section 7. Relationship to Other Service Pathways

The Civil Service Corps shall function as a floor, not a shortcut.

Nothing in this Article shall:

(a) diminish the value or rigor of military, emergency, or other qualifying civic service;
(b) create preference or priority among service pathways;
(c) compel the Republic to expand the Corps in lieu of maintaining other service avenues.

⸻

Section 8. Prohibition on Emergency Drift

No state of emergency, disaster declaration, technological disruption, labor shortage, or national necessity may be invoked to:

(a) relax service standards;
(b) shorten duration;
(c) convert service into symbolic participation;
(d) grant provisional or automatic Civic Citizenship.

All emergency deviations are prohibited unless expressly authorized through the highest constitutional amendment process.

⸻

Section 9. Construction

This Article shall be construed narrowly, defensively, and in subordination to Article III.

Its purpose is to preserve the possibility of earned civic authority, not to guarantee access, employment, or political outcome.

⸻

Section 10. Lock Designation and Non-Erosion Clause

Pursuant to Article XV — Amendments, Lock Clauses, and Anti-Emergency Drift, this Article is hereby designated as LOCK-PROTECTED.

No amendment, statute, executive action, administrative rule, emergency declaration, or judicial doctrine may abolish, suspend, dilute, credential-substitute, or render illusory the capped civic service pathways established herein, or reduce the hardship, duration, public exposure, or integrity of such service, except through the highest procedural threshold and certification of non-diminishment.

This Lock applies to the existence, availability, and rigor of capped service pathways and does not prohibit statutory refinement of implementation details consistent with Article III.

⸻

Article XLIV — Transition, Ratification, and Constitutional Accession

1. Ratification and Supremacy

Upon lawful ratification, this Constitution shall be the supreme law of the Republic. All prior constitutions, charters, statutes, regulations, and executive acts inconsistent with this Constitution are superseded to the extent of the conflict.

No authority may delay, condition, or qualify constitutional supremacy beyond the procedures expressly stated herein.

⸻

2. Continuity of Law and Government

All laws, offices, courts, contracts, and institutions lawfully existing at the time of ratification shall continue temporarily insofar as they do not conflict with this Constitution and until duly conformed, replaced, or repealed under constitutional process.

Continuity shall not be construed to preserve unconstitutional power, immunity, monopoly, or privilege.

⸻

3. Immediate Effect Provisions

The following provisions take immediate effect upon ratification and are not subject to transitional delay:
	•	Supremacy and lock clauses
	•	Inviolable rights and prohibitions
	•	Anti-collusion and anti-capture rules
	•	Non-derogable constraints on emergency power
	•	Standing and access to courts for constitutional claims

Any act taken in violation of immediately effective provisions is void.

⸻

4. Transitional Conformance Period

All remaining institutions and laws shall be brought into compliance within a defined conformance period, to be prescribed by statute and not to exceed a limited duration.

During this period:
	•	No expansion of legacy power is permitted.
	•	No new exclusivities, immunities, or monopolies may be granted.
	•	Courts shall construe ambiguity against preservation of legacy authority and in favor of constitutional alignment.

Failure to conform within the conformance period renders the conflicting provision void.

⸻

5. Judicial Oversight During Transition

Courts shall have original and continuing jurisdiction to adjudicate transitional conflicts.

Where conflict exists:
	1.	constitutional text controls;
	2.	locks and non-derogable provisions control over transitional allowances;
	3.	rights-protective interpretations control over power-preserving ones.

No doctrine of deference, abstention, or political question shall bar review of transitional compliance.

⸻

6. Institutional Reconstitution

Where an existing institution is structurally incompatible with this Constitution and cannot be conformed without defeating constitutional purpose, it shall be reconstituted, replaced, or dissolved by lawful process.

Personnel continuity is not guaranteed where incompatible with constitutional duty.

⸻

7. Accession of Officials and Officers

All public officials shall, as a condition of continued service, affirm accession to this Constitution and acceptance of its supremacy, constraints, and enforcement.

Refusal or violation constitutes grounds for removal.

⸻

8. Protection Against Retroactive Abuse

Nothing in this Article authorizes:
	•	retroactive punishment absent due process,
	•	revival of expired exclusivities,
	•	reinstatement of powers expressly prohibited herein.

Transitional necessity shall not be used to re-create extinguished authority.

⸻

9. Construction and Lock Scope

This Article shall be construed to favor:
	•	constitutional supremacy,
	•	continuity without entrenchment,
	•	transition without capture,
	•	reform without chaos.

The principles governing ratification, supremacy, immediate effect, and non-derogability are structural and may not be suspended or amended except as expressly permitted by this Constitution.

⸻

Article XLV — Right to Repair, Maintain, and Sustain Lawfully Owned Goods

1. Charge and Purpose

This Article secures the right of all persons to repair, maintain, modify, and sustain lawfully owned goods, and to prevent artificial scarcity, forced obsolescence, post-sale control, or dependency inconsistent with ownership.

Ownership shall confer practical control and durability, not merely nominal title.

⸻

2. Core Right

Any person who lawfully owns a physical or digital good has the right to:
	•	repair, maintain, and service the good;
	•	replace, fabricate, or source parts necessary for continued function;
	•	modify the good for personal, commercial, adaptive, or interoperability purposes;
	•	retain full use independent of the original manufacturer.

These rights shall not be waived or limited by contract, license, warranty terms, or unilateral conditions of sale.

⸻

3. Access to Repair Necessities

Manufacturers and vendors shall not withhold from lawful owners or independent repair providers:
	•	replacement parts;
	•	tools and equipment;
	•	diagnostic software and interfaces;
	•	firmware, source access, or documentation necessary for repair or maintenance.

Such materials shall be made available on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms, without inflated pricing, artificial delays, or preferential treatment of authorized channels.

⸻

4. Prohibition of Repair Interference

The following practices are prohibited:
	•	use of digital locks, DRM, authentication, serialization, or “parts pairing” to prevent or degrade lawful repair or use of non-original parts;
	•	conditioning functionality, features, updates, or continued operation on manufacturer authorization, subscriptions, or proprietary services;
	•	deploying software or firmware updates that disable, degrade, or brick goods due to independent repair, modification, or part substitution;
	•	remotely disabling, throttling, or impairing goods absent a genuine and immediate safety necessity;
	•	requiring waiver of repair rights as a condition of sale, warranty, or continued use.

Any such interference is void and constitutes an abuse of exclusivity.

⸻

5. Relationship to Intellectual Property

Repair, maintenance, sustaining modification, and interoperability shall not constitute infringement where no consumer confusion or misrepresentation is involved.

No assertion of copyright, patent, trade secret, or analogous protection shall prevent access to tools, firmware, or software necessary for diagnosis, maintenance, restoration, or compatibility, including reasonable reverse engineering and circumvention for those purposes.

Intellectual property shall not be construed to impose perpetual post-sale control.

⸻

6. Safety and Environmental Compliance

Repaired or modified goods remain subject to generally applicable safety and environmental standards.

Such standards shall not be applied discriminatorily or as a pretext to restrict independent repair.
The burden rests on the manufacturer to demonstrate that any restriction is strictly necessary for genuine safety or environmental protection.

⸻

7. Remedies and Enforcement

Violations of this Article render the offending restriction void.

Enforcement shall include:
	•	injunctive relief;
	•	restoration of functionality;
	•	civil liability;
	•	attorney’s fees and costs.

Standing shall be broad, including owners, independent repairers, and downstream users.

⸻

8. Construction and Lock Status

This Article shall be construed broadly in favor of repair, durability, and user autonomy, and narrowly against enclosure, dependency, or post-sale domination.

The right to repair, maintain, and sustain lawfully owned goods is structural and non-derogable and may not be suspended by emergency, trade agreement, administrative convenience, or technological design.

⸻Article XLVI – Rex Pro Tempore and Total Defense Authority
Charge
This Article exists solely to give the President the power to lay waste to any enemy who dares declare war on the Republic. It does not grant the President the right to declare war on poverty, drugs, or any other social ill that cannot be fought by military means.
Section 1. Purpose, Non-Derogation, and Lock Protection
This Article exists solely to preserve the Republic against imminent existential destruction when ordinary constitutional processes cannot respond in time. It shall be construed narrowly, invoked reluctantly, and terminated immediately upon cessation of the threat.
Nothing herein authorizes:
	•	permanent alteration of constitutional structure;
	•	suspension or reinterpretation of lock-protected provisions (Article XV);
	•	derogation of unamendable core rights (life, due process in non-sabotage cases, free conscience absent direct enemy action);
	•	consolidation of power beyond the acute defense phase; or
	•	use as pretext for ordinary governance, political suppression, or entrenchment.
This Article is lock-protected per Article XV: no amendment, suspension, reinterpretation, or circumvention may dilute its narrow scope, strict triggers, automatic sunsets, or accountability mechanisms except by the highest procedural threshold and explicit certification of non-diminishment.
Section 2. Triggering Conditions (Existential Threat Certification)
Total Defense Authority activates only upon certification of a clear, imminent, and existential threat to the Republic's survival, limited to: 
a. large-scale armed invasion of sovereign territory by foreign military forces;
b. sustained, coordinated attacks causing or imminently likely to cause mass civilian casualties or total collapse of essential national infrastructure;
c. credible, imminent nuclear, biological, chemical, or comparably catastrophic attack expected within hours or days;
d. armed insurrection materially directed or substantially supported by a foreign adversary, where ordinary processes (including federalized militia and Article XXIV mechanisms) cannot contain it in time to prevent existential harm.
The President shall issue a written finding specifying the factual basis, transmitted immediately (within 4 hours) to:
	•	both chambers of the Legislature;
	•	the Constitutional Review Court (CRC);
	•	the Constitutional Judicial Commission (CJC);
	•	the Supreme Court of the Republic;
	•	and the public (redactions only for strictly operational security, subject to immediate CRC review).
The CRC shall have original jurisdiction to review and vacate the finding if it fails clear-and-convincing evidentiary standards or exceeds the enumerated triggers. CJC concurrence is required for activation if institutional abuse is alleged.
Transmission within 4 hours satisfies any longer notice window elsewhere in this Constitution.
Section 3. Designation and Scope of Authority
Upon valid activation, the President temporarily assumes the designation President Rex Pro Tempore (Latin: "King for the Time Being" — denoting temporary, emergency-only supreme defensive command) and exercises Total Defense Authority solely to repel or neutralize the existential threat.
This is not a new office or title; it confers no permanence and expires per Section 6.
Section 4. Limited Powers in the Acute Phase
The President Rex Pro Tempore may exercise only the following, each strictly necessary and proportional to the certified threat: a. unified command of all federal armed forces, reserves, National Guard (federalized per law), and lawfully constituted militia; b. requisition of private resources, infrastructure, or industrial capacity essential for immediate defense (with mandatory post-crisis compensation at fair market value plus interest); c. conscription or compulsory national service only when voluntary means are demonstrably insufficient (time-limited, subject to legislative override); d. temporary suspension of non-essential procedural requirements (e.g., certain permitting delays) that would render timely defensive action impossible.
All actions must directly advance defense and cease upon threat resolution.
Section 5. Absolute Prohibitions (Non-Derogable)
Even under Total Defense Authority, the President Rex Pro Tempore shall not:
a. amend, suspend, reinterpret, or bypass any provision of this Constitution;
b. abolish, postpone, or interfere with elections or political processes except as narrowly required to protect polling sites from direct attack (any such measure expires with the acute phase);
c. criminalize, censor, or punish speech, dissent, association, religion, or political opposition unrelated to direct sabotage, espionage, or enemy coordination;
d. alter the structure, independence, jurisdiction, or composition of the judiciary, Legislature, states, or constitutional oversight bodies (CRC, CJC);
e. expand authority for economic, social, ideological, or partisan purposes;
f. delegate Total Defense Authority to any unelected body or private actor;
g. create generally applicable rules or new legal obligations outside immediate defense/mitigation operations; all such rules require ordinary law.
Violation of any prohibition constitutes grave (Tier Three) constitutional malfeasance, triggering mandatory CJC investigation and CRC nullification.
Section 6. Automatic Sunset, Ratification, and Renewal
Total Defense Authority expires automatically after 72 hours unless ratified by simple majority of both legislative chambers.
Upon ratification, authority continues for up to 90 days.
Renewal beyond 90 days requires: a. 60% supermajority of both chambers; b. renewed CRC certification that the existential threat persists (clear and convincing evidence); c. CJC certification that no abuse, prolongation, or deviation has occurred.
The President may not unilaterally renew or extend. Failure to meet renewal thresholds causes immediate reversion to ordinary governance.
Section 7. Termination, Reversion, and Restoration
Upon expiration or termination: a. all emergency orders lapse automatically unless re-enacted by ordinary law; b. requisitioned property returns or is compensated within 180 days; c. emergency detentions convert to ordinary criminal/civil process or terminate; d. suspended procedures restore immediately; e. no emergency precedent survives or justifies future action.
Section 8. Mandatory Post-Crisis Review and Accountability
Within 30 days of termination, the CJC and CRC shall jointly conduct a public review assessing:
	•	necessity and proportionality;
	•	adherence to limits;
	•	duration and any prolongation;
	•	evidence of abuse, profiteering, suppression, or bad-faith invocation.
Findings are public; abuse triggers mandatory referral for grave offense prosecution (Article VII), removal/disqualification, and civil liability. No immunity applies.
Section 9. Popular Override and Removal
Upon petition by 10% of Civic Citizens (corrected from your 20% typo), a national referendum may: a. nullify specific ultra vires actions; b. remove the President for abuse or bad-faith invocation.
Approval requires 60% of Civic Citizens voting. Interference constitutes malfeasance.
Section 10. Conscription and Civic Credit
Any person conscripted under this Article who does not have a criminal record barring them from voting or holding office shall not have their conscription manipulated, delayed, or otherwise gamed to avoid granting them credit toward Civic Citizenship under Article III.
Upon conscription, the two-year time clock for earning such credit begins immediately for those who have not already served, and may not be manipulated, suspended, or otherwise gamed to avoid rendering the credit due, unless the recruit leaves voluntarily or is dishonorably discharged for cause, subject to due process.
Section 11. Interpretation and Supremacy
This Article shall be interpreted to: a. enable swift, decisive defense against genuine existential peril; b. prevent any emergency from becoming permanent or pretextual; c. prioritize rapid restoration of constitutional normalcy; d. treat abuse more severely than defensive hesitation.
In conflict with any other provision, this Article's narrow constraints and safeguards control. The Republic endures its enemies without becoming one.

Article XLVI-A – Imperator Pro Tempore and Asymmetric Defense Authority
Charge
This Article exists solely to empower the Republic to combat non-military existential threats that imperil the survival of the People or the constitutional order, such as pandemics or large-scale electronic infiltration. It does not grant authority to declare emergencies for social, economic, ideological, or policy purposes, nor may it be invoked for metaphorical "wars" on poverty, drugs, crime, inequality, climate, misinformation, or any other ill not constituting an immediate, verifiable existential peril capable of causing mass death or systemic collapse.
Section 1. Purpose, Non-Derogation, and Lock Protection
This Article exists solely to preserve the Republic against imminent non-military existential destruction—such as pandemics or electronic infiltration—when ordinary constitutional processes cannot respond in time. It shall be construed narrowly, invoked reluctantly, and terminated immediately upon cessation of the threat.
Nothing herein authorizes:
	•	permanent alteration of constitutional structure;
	•	suspension or reinterpretation of lock-protected provisions (Article XV);
	•	derogation of unamendable core rights (life, due process in non-sabotage cases, free conscience absent direct enemy action, bodily autonomy, free movement absent individualized quarantine orders);
	•	consolidation of power beyond the acute defense phase; or
	•	use as pretext for ordinary governance, political suppression, entrenchment, demographic engineering, or ideological control.
This Article is lock-protected per Article XV: no amendment, suspension, reinterpretation, or circumvention may dilute its narrow scope, strict triggers, automatic sunsets, or accountability mechanisms except by the highest procedural threshold and explicit certification of non-diminishment.
Section 2. Triggering Conditions (Existential Threat Certification)
Asymmetric Defense Authority activates only upon certification of a clear, imminent, and existential non-military threat to the Republic’s survival, limited to:

a. A highly contagious pandemic disease with verified high mortality or debilitating effects, causing or imminently likely to cause mass casualties or societal collapse absent immediate intervention;

b. Large-scale electronic infiltration or cyber attacks crippling essential national infrastructure (e.g., power grids, financial systems, communications), directed by a foreign adversary or equivalent actor, where ordinary defenses cannot contain it in time;

c. Other asymmetric threats of comparable scale, such as radiological dispersal or biological terrorism, verified to pose immediate existential harm and incapable of mitigation through standard processes.
Economic downturns, social unrest, environmental changes, public health trends without mass lethality, or speculative risks do not qualify.
The President shall issue a written finding specifying the factual basis, supported by independent scientific or technical evidence, transmitted immediately (within 4 hours) to:
	•	both chambers of the Legislature;
	•	the Constitutional Review Court (CRC);
	•	the Constitutional Judicial Commission (CJC);
	•	the Supreme Court of the Republic;
	•	and the public (redactions only for strictly operational security, subject to immediate CRC review).
The CRC shall have original jurisdiction to review and vacate the finding if it fails clear-and-convincing evidentiary standards or exceeds the enumerated triggers. CJC concurrence is required for activation if institutional abuse is alleged.
Transmission within 4 hours satisfies any longer notice window elsewhere in this Constitution.
Section 3. Designation and Scope of Authority
Upon valid activation, the President temporarily assumes the designation Imperator Pro Tempore and exercises Asymmetric Defense Authority solely to mitigate or neutralize the existential threat.
This is not a new office or title; it confers no permanence and expires per Section 6.
Section 4. Limited Powers in the Acute Phase
The Imperator Pro Tempore may exercise only the following, each strictly necessary and proportional to the certified threat:
a. coordination of federal and state resources for containment, including temporary quarantines based on individualized, evidence-based risk (subject to immediate judicial review);
b. requisition of private resources, infrastructure, or industrial capacity essential for immediate mitigation (e.g., medical supplies for pandemics, cybersecurity tools for electronic threats), with mandatory post-crisis compensation at fair market value plus interest;
c. compulsory national service in non-combat roles (e.g., medical aid, cyber response) only when voluntary means are demonstrably insufficient (time-limited, subject to legislative override, and respecting conscientious objection where alternatives exist);
d. temporary suspension of non-essential procedural requirements (e.g., certain regulatory delays) that would render timely mitigation impossible.
All actions must directly advance mitigation, prioritize voluntary compliance, and cease upon threat resolution. No power herein authorizes mandatory medical interventions, surveillance expansion, or restrictions on free exercise of rights without individualized due process.
Section 5. Absolute Prohibitions (Non-Derogable)
Even under Asymmetric Defense Authority, the Imperator Pro Tempore shall not:
a. amend, suspend, reinterpret, or bypass any provision of this Constitution; 
b. abolish, postpone, or interfere with elections or political processes except as narrowly required to protect public safety from direct threat exposure (any such measure expires with the acute phase);
c. criminalize, censor, or punish speech, dissent, association, religion, or political opposition unrelated to direct sabotage, espionage, or threat facilitation;
d. alter the structure, independence, jurisdiction, or composition of the judiciary, Legislature, states, or constitutional oversight bodies (CRC, CJC);
e. expand authority for economic, social, ideological, partisan, or demographic purposes, including lockdowns without sunset, vaccine mandates without informed consent, or digital tracking without warrants;
f. delegate Asymmetric Defense Authority to any unelected body, private actor, or international entity;
g. create generally applicable rules or new legal obligations outside immediate defense/mitigation operations; all such rules require ordinary law.
Violation of any prohibition constitutes grave (Tier Three) constitutional malfeasance, triggering mandatory CJC investigation and CRC nullification.
Section 6. Automatic Sunset, Ratification, and Renewal
Asymmetric Defense Authority expires automatically after 72 hours unless ratified by simple majority of both legislative chambers.
Upon ratification, authority may continue for a total period of up to 90 days, inclusive of the initial acute phase.
Renewal beyond 90 days requires: a. 60% supermajority of both chambers; b. renewed CRC certification that the existential threat persists (clear and convincing evidence, including independent expert review); c. CJC certification that no abuse, prolongation, or deviation has occurred.
The President may not unilaterally renew or extend. Failure to meet renewal thresholds causes immediate reversion to ordinary governance.
Section 7. Termination, Reversion, and Restoration
When this authority ends: a. all emergency orders lapse automatically unless re-enacted by ordinary law; b. requisitioned property returns or is compensated within 180 days; c. emergency restrictions (e.g., quarantines) convert to voluntary measures or terminate; d. suspended procedures restore immediately; e. no emergency precedent survives or justifies future action.
Section 8. Mandatory Post-Crisis Review and Accountability
Within 30 days of termination, the CJC and CRC shall jointly conduct a public review assessing:
	•	necessity and proportionality;
	•	adherence to limits;
	•	duration and any prolongation;
	•	evidence of abuse, profiteering, suppression, or bad-faith invocation.
Findings are public; abuse triggers mandatory referral for grave offense prosecution (Article VII), removal/disqualification, and civil liability. No immunity applies.
Section 9. Popular Override and Removal
Upon petition by 10% of Civic Citizens, a national referendum may: a. nullify specific ultra vires actions; b. remove the President for abuse or bad-faith invocation.
Approval requires 60% of Civic Citizens voting. Interference constitutes malfeasance.
Section 10. Compulsory Service and Civic Credit
Any person conscripted into compulsory national service under this Article who does not have a criminal record barring them from voting or holding office shall not have their service manipulated, delayed, or otherwise gamed to avoid granting them credit toward Civic Citizenship under Article III.
Upon conscription, the two-year time clock for earning such credit begins immediately for those who have not already served, and may not be manipulated, suspended, or otherwise gamed to avoid rendering the credit due, unless the recruit leaves voluntarily or is dishonorably discharged for cause, subject to due process.
Section 11. Interpretation and Supremacy
This Article shall be interpreted to: 
a. enable swift, decisive mitigation against genuine existential non-military perils;
b. prevent any emergency from becoming permanent or pretextual; 
c. prioritize rapid restoration of constitutional normalcy and liberty;
d. treat abuse more severely than defensive hesitation.
In conflict with any other provision, this Article's narrow constraints and safeguards control. The Republic safeguards its People without sacrificing their freedoms.

Article V — The Executive Branch

Charge

This Article establishes the authority, duties, and limits of the executive branch of the Republic. Executive power shall be exercised solely for the faithful execution of the law and shall not be used to create, suspend, alter, or evade law except where expressly authorized by this Constitution. All executive actions, directives, and assertions of emergency or discretionary authority shall be construed narrowly and shall remain subject to legislative constraint and judicial review.


Section 1. Vesting of Executive Authority
 
(a). Vesting of Executive Authority
 
The executive power of the Republic is vested in a President, who shall serve as the chief executive officer of the Republic and shall execute the laws faithfully, subject at all times to this Constitution.
 
The President is not the source of law, policy, or authority, but the instrument for lawful execution.
 

 
(b). Enumerated Nature of Executive Power
 
Executive authority exists only as expressly enumerated by this Constitution and by laws enacted pursuant to it.
 
No executive power shall be construed to arise from:
• implication,
• historical practice,
• necessity,
• emergency,
• national security,
• custom,
• or prerogative.
 
Any claim of inherent, residual, implied, or emergency executive power is expressly repudiated.
 

 
(c). Execution Distinguished from Lawmaking
 
The Executive shall execute and administer the law as written.
 
Execution does not include:
• creating generally applicable rules,
• expanding statutory scope,
• imposing new obligations or prohibitions,
• conditioning rights or benefits beyond statute,
• or substituting executive judgment for legislative choice.
 
Any executive action that binds private conduct, alters legal rights, or establishes general rules shall constitute unlawful lawmaking and is void.
 

 
(d). Duty of Constitutional Fidelity
 
The President and all executive officers bear an independent and non-delegable duty to uphold the Constitution.
 
No officer may excuse unconstitutional action by:
• delegation,
• reliance on counsel,
• classification,
• internal executive interpretation,
• or superior order.
 
Unconstitutional orders are unlawful and shall not be obeyed.
 

 
(e). Limits on Administrative Authority
 
Administrative discretion exists solely to carry out lawful execution within clearly defined statutory bounds.
 
Discretion shall not be used to:
• alter legislative intent,
• evade statutory limits,
• create de facto policy,
• or regulate by enforcement selection.
 
Administrative acts exceeding these bounds are unconstitutional and void.
 

 
(f). Enforceability and Standing
 
Any act of the Executive Branch that exceeds or contravenes the authority granted by this Article is void ab initio.
 
Standing to challenge such acts is granted to:
1.  any person subject to or affected by the act;
2.  any member of the Legislature;
3.  any Inspector General or Special Prosecutor;
4.  the Constitutional Judicial Commission.
 
No showing of special injury beyond constitutional violation shall be required.
 

 
(g). Mandatory Judicial Review
 
Upon a prima facie showing that executive authority has been exceeded, the Constitutional Review Court shall review the act on an expedited basis.
 
No court may decline review on grounds of:
• political question doctrine,
• executive discretion,
• necessity,
• national security deference,
• or historical practice.
 

 
(h). Consequences of Ultra Vires Action
 
Any executive officer who knowingly authorizes, orders, or enforces an unconstitutional act commits constitutional malfeasance.
 
Such malfeasance shall result in:
1.  immediate cessation of the unlawful act;
2.  personal liability where harm is caused;
3.  mandatory referral for investigation under Section 5;
4.  disqualification from office where willfulness is established.
 
Good-faith reliance does not excuse continued enforcement once invalidity is determined.
 

 
(i). Relationship to Emergency Powers
 
No provision of this Section may be suspended, reinterpreted, or bypassed by an emergency declaration.
 
Emergency powers, where permitted, operate within these limits and confer no additional authority.
 
Section 2. Restrictions on Executive Authority
 
(a) Non-Suspension of Constitutional Rights
 
The Executive Branch shall not suspend, derogate, condition, or diminish any right guaranteed by this Constitution, whether directly or indirectly, including by emergency declaration, regulation, executive order, guidance, enforcement priority, or omission.
 
No balancing test, necessity claim, or national security rationale shall justify infringement of constitutional rights.

(b) No Rule by Decree
 
The Executive shall not govern by decree.
 
No executive order, proclamation, directive, memorandum, or guidance may substitute for law enacted by the Legislature, nor may any such instrument create new legal obligations, prohibitions, penalties, or conditions applicable to persons or entities outside the Executive Branch.

(c) No Executive Lawmaking or Policy Substitution
 
The Executive shall not:
	•	create generally applicable rules;
	•	expand or narrow statutory scope;
	•	impose policy preferences not enacted by law;
	•	condition access to rights, benefits, or services beyond statute.
 
Any such act constitutes unlawful lawmaking and is void.

(d) No Circumvention by Delegation or Interpretation
 
The Executive shall not evade the restrictions of this Section through:
	•	delegation to agencies or contractors;
	•	reliance on interpretive guidance;
	•	selective enforcement or non-enforcement;
	•	classification or secrecy;
	•	informal coordination bodies, task forces, or advisors.
 
Substance shall control over form.

(e) No Control of Elections or Political Process
 
The Executive shall not interfere with:
	•	the timing, conduct, or certification of elections;
	•	voter eligibility or ballot access;
	•	political association, candidacy, or opposition activity.
 
Any executive action affecting electoral processes is presumptively unconstitutional.

(f) No Financial Coercion Beyond Law
 
The Executive shall not:
	•	expend public funds absent lawful appropriation;
	•	condition funding to coerce political or constitutional compliance;
	•	reprogram funds to achieve objectives not authorized by law.

(g) No Militarization of Civil Authority
 
The Executive shall not deploy military or paramilitary forces for domestic governance, law enforcement, or political control except as expressly authorized by this Constitution and subject to civilian judicial oversight.
 
Military necessity shall not override constitutional restraint.

(h) Automatic Nullity
 
Any executive action taken in violation of this Section is void ab initio and without legal effect.
 
No validating statute, emergency declaration, internal approval, or subsequent ratification may cure such invalidity.

(i) Standing and Cause of Action
 
Standing to challenge violations of this Section is granted to:
	•	any person directly or indirectly affected;
	•	any member of the Legislature;
	•	any Inspector General or Special Prosecutor;
	•	the Constitutional Judicial Commission.
 
No exhaustion of administrative remedies shall be required.

(j) Mandatory Judicial Review
 
The Constitutional Review Court shall hear claims arising under this Section on an expedited basis.
 
No court may decline review on grounds of:
	•	political question doctrine;
	•	executive discretion;
	•	necessity or emergency;
	•	national security deference;
	•	historical practice.

(k) Personal Responsibility
 
Any executive officer who knowingly authorizes, orders, or enforces an action prohibited by this Section commits constitutional malfeasance.
 
Such malfeasance shall result in:
	•	immediate cessation of the unlawful act;
	•	personal civil liability where harm is shown;
	•	mandatory referral for investigation under Section 5;
	•	disqualification from office where willfulness is established.

(l) Duty to Refuse Unlawful Orders
 
No executive officer or employee shall obey an order that violates this Section.
 
Compliance with unlawful orders is not a defense once unconstitutionality is apparent.

Section 3 — Election, Term, Removal, and Succession

(a) Election and Term

The President shall be elected by the People in the manner prescribed by this Constitution and shall serve a fixed term of office.

No extension, suspension, or alteration of the presidential term shall occur except by constitutional amendment.

The President may be removed from office for:
	1.	constitutional malfeasance;
	2.	willful violation of this Constitution;
	3.	treason or other high crimes as defined herein;
	4.	incapacity rendering the President unable to discharge the duties of office.

Political disagreement or lawful exercise of constitutional authority shall not constitute grounds for removal.



(d) Legislative Removal Process

The Legislature shall have the authority to initiate removal proceedings.

Removal shall require:
	1.	formal charges adopted by the lower chamber; and
	2.	conviction by the upper chamber upon the evidentiary standard prescribed by this Constitution.

Proceedings shall be conducted publicly, except where narrowly necessary to protect classified information, and shall be subject to judicial review for constitutional compliance.



(e) Mandatory Timelines

Removal proceedings, once initiated, shall proceed without undue delay.

No chamber may suspend, stall, or indefinitely defer proceedings once charges are formally adopted.

Failure to act within prescribed timelines constitutes constitutional malfeasance.



(f) Judicial Review

The Supreme Court of the Republic shall have original jurisdiction to review:
	1.	the constitutional sufficiency of charges;
	2.	compliance with procedural requirements; and
	3.	the validity of removal or acquittal.

The political question doctrine shall not apply.



(g) Temporary Incapacity

Where the President is temporarily unable to discharge the duties of office, authority shall pass to the Vice President as Acting President, pursuant to procedures established by law.

Determinations of incapacity shall be subject to:
	1.	medical certification;
	2.	legislative oversight; and
	3.	expedited judicial review.



(h) Permanent Incapacity or Vacancy

In the event of death, resignation, lawful removal, or permanent incapacity, the Vice President shall assume the office of President for the remainder of the term.

If no Vice President is available, succession shall proceed as provided by law, consistent with this Constitution.

The People retain the sovereign authority to remove the President from office.

Upon petition by twenty percent (20%) of Civic Citizens, a national removal vote shall be held.

Removal shall occur upon approval by two-thirds (2/3) of Civic Citizens voting.

Interference with this process constitutes constitutional malfeasance.

Upon removal:
	1.	presidential authority shall cease immediately;
	2.	all executive orders issued in violation of this Constitution shall be void;
	3.	the removed officer shall remain subject to civil and criminal liability as provided by law.

Removal from office does not constitute immunity from prosecution.



(k) Continuity and Stability

Continuity of government shall be maintained at all times within constitutional bounds.



Section 4 — Executive Departments, Cabinet, and Temporary Offices

(a) Executive Departments

The Executive Branch shall be composed of executive departments established by law.

No department may be created, merged, dissolved, or substantially reorganized except by statute enacted by the Legislature.



(b) Cabinet

The heads of executive departments shall constitute the Cabinet.

Cabinet officers:
	1.	shall be appointed in the manner prescribed by law;
	2.	shall exercise authority only within the statutory scope of their departments; and
	3.	shall remain individually accountable for constitutional compliance.

No Cabinet officer may exercise authority outside the department to which they are appointed.

(d) Temporary Executive Offices and Coordinators

The President may establish temporary executive offices, task forces, special teams, or executive coordinators solely to assist in the execution of existing law.

Such entities are collectively governed by this Section, regardless of title or form.



(e) Purpose and Scope

Any temporary executive office or coordinator shall:
	1.	be created for a specific, narrowly defined purpose;
	2.	possess no independent regulatory or rulemaking authority;
	3.	issue no binding directives outside the Executive Branch; and
	4.	exist solely to coordinate lawful execution within established departments.



(f) Time Limits

A temporary executive office or coordinator shall exist for no more than eighteen (18) months from the date of creation.



(g) Extension Requirements

A temporary executive office may be extended only upon:
	1.	approval by Congress every six (6) months by majority vote of each chamber;
	2.	initial certification by Constitutional Review Court that the office remains necessary, narrowly tailored, and constitutionally compliant; and
	3.	notwithstanding the right of the Supreme Court of the Republic to review the case and decide if it has merit to the interpretation of the constitution.

No extension may exceed six (6) months.



(h) Automatic Dissolution

Upon expiration of its authorized term:
	1.	the temporary office or coordinator shall be automatically dissolved;
	2.	all delegated authority shall cease;
	3.	all employment, contracts, and assignments shall terminate.

No residual authority may persist after dissolution.



(i) No Carryover Between Administrations

No temporary executive office or coordinator may persist beyond the term of the President who created it.

Continuation under a subsequent President requires reconstitution as a new office, with new staff and fresh approvals under this Section.



(j) Popular Dissolution

Any temporary executive office or coordinator may be dissolved by the People upon:
	1.	petition by twenty percent (20%) of Civic Citizens; and
	2.	approval by two-thirds (2/3) of Civic Citizens voting.

Dissolution shall take effect within seventy-two (72) hours of certification.



(k) Anti-Evasion Rule

No executive office may evade the requirements of this Section through:
	•	renaming or rebranding;
	•	subdivision or consolidation;
	•	informal delegation;
	•	classification as advisory; or
	•	placement within another office.

Substance shall control over form.



Section 5 — Oversight, Inspectors General, and Special Prosecutors

(a) Independent Oversight Required

Independent oversight of the Executive Branch is a constitutional requirement.

Inspectors General and Special Prosecutors shall exist to investigate illegality, constitutional violations, abuse of authority, fraud, corruption, obstruction, and retaliation within the Executive Branch.



(b) Inspectors General

An Inspector General shall exist for each executive department and for any executive agency designated by law.

Inspectors General shall:
	1.	operate independently of department leadership;
	2.	have authority to access all records, personnel, and facilities necessary to perform constitutional duties; and
	3.	report findings without alteration, suppression, or delay.



(c) Appointment and Continuity

Inspectors General shall be appointed in the manner prescribed by law and shall continue in office notwithstanding changes in administration.

A vacancy shall be filled within thirty (30) days.

If the Executive fails to appoint within the required period, the CJC shall designate an interim candidate list (integrity screen), and the CRC shall confirm by expedited order, until a lawful appointment is made.



(d) Removal for Cause Only

An Inspector General or Special Prosecutor may be removed only for:
	1.	demonstrated incapacity;
	2.	criminal conviction; or
	3.	proven misconduct unrelated to the substance or targets of any investigation.

Removal requires:
	•	written findings;
	•	immediate notice to the Legislature and the Constitutional Judicial Commission; and
	•	expedited judicial review.

Improper removal is void.



(e) Special Prosecutors

A Special Prosecutor shall be appointed when:
	1.	credible evidence indicates executive misconduct implicating senior officials;
	2.	an Inspector General makes a referral;
	3.	the Legislature so directs; or
	4.	the Constitutional Judicial Commission makes a referral to the Constitutional Review Court who approves the appointment.

Special Prosecutors shall be independent of executive control and shall exercise prosecutorial authority as provided by law.



(f) Mandatory Investigation Triggers

An Inspector General or Special Prosecutor shall initiate an investigation upon receipt of:
	1.	credible evidence of constitutional or statutory violation;
	2.	a protected whistleblower disclosure;
	3.	a referral from a court, legislative committee, or the Constitutional Judicial Commission; or
	4.	evidence of obstruction or retaliation.

Failure to initiate an investigation within seven (7) days requires written justification, logged publicly and subject to review by the Constitutional Judicial Commission.

Failure to act on a referral from the Constitutional Judicial Commission constitutes prima facie evidence of obstruction.


(g) Subpoena Authority and Enforcement

Inspectors General and Special Prosecutors may issue subpoenas for testimony, documents, and records.

Subpoenas shall be complied with within ten (10) days, unless extended by a court for good cause shown.

Courts shall enforce subpoenas on an expedited basis.

No claim of executive privilege, classification, or internal policy shall bar production, subject only to secure handling procedures.



(h) Budgetary Independence

Inspectors General and Special Prosecutors shall receive separate, line-item appropriations sufficient to carry out constitutional duties.

Funding shall not be reduced below the prior fiscal year’s level except by:
	1.	a two-thirds vote of each chamber of the Legislature; and
	2.	certification by the Constitutional Judicial Commission that oversight capacity is not impaired.

Budgetary manipulation intended to obstruct oversight constitutes constitutional malfeasance.



(i) Anti-Retaliation and Obstruction

Retaliation against witnesses, whistleblowers, or oversight personnel, or obstruction of oversight activities, constitutes constitutional malfeasance.

Such acts shall trigger mandatory investigation and referral.



(j) Duty to Refer

Where probable cause exists that a constitutional offense has occurred, an Inspector General or Special Prosecutor shall refer the matter for prosecution in accordance with law.

Failure to refer absent written justification constitutes malfeasance.



(k) Transparency and Reporting

Findings of Inspectors General and Special Prosecutors shall be reported publicly, subject only to narrow redactions necessary to protect ongoing investigations or classified material.

Classification shall not be used to conceal illegality or constitutional violations.



Section 6 — Executive Crimes, Malfeasance, and Mandatory Referral

(a) Constitutional Malfeasance Defined

Constitutional malfeasance occurs when an executive officer knowingly or recklessly:
	1.	exceeds constitutional authority;
	2.	violates an express constitutional prohibition;
	3.	obstructs constitutional oversight;
	4.	retaliates against lawful whistleblowers or witnesses; or
	5.	abuses office to entrench power, evade accountability, or suppress lawful opposition.

Constitutional malfeasance is distinct from policy error or good-faith disagreement.



(b) Mens Rea

Executive constitutional offenses require one of the following mental states:
	1.	Willfulness — conscious intent to violate this Constitution;
	2.	Knowing disregard — awareness of a substantial risk of unconstitutionality and proceeding anyway;
	3.	Recklessness — conscious indifference to constitutional limits where duty to know exists.

Negligence alone shall not constitute constitutional malfeasance.



(c) No Immunity by Office

No executive officer, including the President, Vice President, or Cabinet officers, shall possess immunity from investigation, indictment, or prosecution for constitutional offenses.

Office shall not shield unlawful conduct.



(d) Duty to Refuse Unconstitutional Orders

No executive officer or employee shall obey an order that is unconstitutional on its face or whose unconstitutionality is reasonably apparent.

Compliance with unlawful orders does not excuse liability once constitutional violation is known or should have been known.



(e) Mandatory Referral

Where probable cause exists that a constitutional offense has occurred, referral for investigation or prosecution is mandatory.

Mandatory referral shall be triggered by:
	1.	an Inspector General;
	2.	a Special Prosecutor;
	3.	a court;
	4.	the Legislature; or
	5.	the Constitutional Judicial Commission.

Failure to refer absent written justification constitutes constitutional malfeasance.



(f) Suspension Pending Adjudication

Upon formal finding of probable cause for constitutional malfeasance, an executive officer may be suspended from duties pending adjudication, pursuant to procedures established by law.

Suspension shall not be punitive and shall not imply guilt.



(g) No Pardon for Constitutional Offenses

No pardon, commutation, or clemency may be granted for:
	1.	constitutional malfeasance;
	2.	obstruction of constitutional oversight;
	3.	retaliation against whistleblowers; or
	4.	offenses arising from abuse of executive authority.



(h) Relationship to Removal

Criminal liability under this Section is independent of removal proceedings under Section 3.

Acquittal in removal proceedings shall not bar criminal prosecution, and criminal prosecution shall not substitute for removal where removal is warranted.



(i) Non-Preemption by Statute

No statute, regulation, executive agreement, or internal policy may waive, narrow, or preempt liability for constitutional offenses defined by this Section.



(j) Evidentiary Access

Claims of executive privilege, classification, or national security shall not bar investigation or adjudication of constitutional offenses.

Courts shall establish secure procedures to receive sensitive evidence without foreclosing accountability.



(k) Referral to Article VII

Classification of offenses, tiers of severity, and authorized penalties for violations of this Section shall be governed exclusively by Article VII.

This Section establishes duty, liability, and referral, not punishment.



Section 7 — Emergency Powers

(a) Purpose and Narrow Construction

Emergency powers exist solely to permit the rapid execution of existing law in response to a sudden, extraordinary, and demonstrable threat that cannot be addressed through ordinary constitutional processes in time to prevent grave harm.

Emergency powers shall be construed narrowly and shall not create new authority.

This Section governs ordinary emergency declarations; existential defense authorities are governed exclusively by Article XLVI and Article XLVI-A.

(b) Conditions for Declaration

An emergency may be declared only upon a written finding that:
	1.	a concrete and imminent threat exists to life, territorial integrity, or constitutional order; and
	2.	ordinary legislative or administrative mechanisms are insufficient to address the threat within the required time.

Generalized risk, policy disagreement, economic conditions, or administrative convenience shall not constitute grounds for declaration.


(c) Form and Notice

Any emergency declaration shall:
	1.	be issued in writing;
	2.	specify the precise factual basis, geographic scope, and constitutional authority relied upon; and
	3.	be transmitted within twenty-four (24) hours to:
		•	both chambers of the Legislature;
		•	the Supreme Court of the Republic; and
		•	the Constitutional Review Court.

Failure to transmit voids the declaration.



(d) Immediate Constitutional Limits

During an emergency, the Executive shall not:
	1.	suspend, derogate, or condition constitutional rights;
	2.	alter election procedures, timing, or certification;
	3.	extend terms of office;
	4.	create new crimes or penalties;
	5.	authorize detention without charge;
	6.	censor lawful speech or press; or
	7.	expend funds absent lawful appropriation.



(e) Initial Duration

An emergency declaration shall expire automatically after seven (7) days unless renewed.

No emergency action may persist beyond expiration.



(f) Renewal Requirements
	1.	First renewal:
Requires a majority vote of each chamber and extends the emergency no more than fourteen (14) days.
	2.	Second renewal:
Requires a two-thirds vote of each chamber and extends the emergency no more than thirty (30) days.

Each renewal must include updated written findings satisfying subsection (b).



(g) Time Cap (Ordinary Emergencies)

No emergency declared under this Section may continue beyond ninety (90) total days unless this Constitution expressly authorizes extension under another Article.

Any extension must cite the specific Article relied upon and shall satisfy that Article’s procedures, findings, vote thresholds, and sunset terms.

Authorities activated under Article XLVI or Article XLVI-A are governed exclusively by their own sunset and renewal rules.

(h) Judicial Review
The Constitutional Review Court shall have original and mandatory jurisdiction to review:
	1.	the validity of any emergency declaration;
	2.	compliance with procedural requirements; and
	3.	the constitutionality of actions taken thereunder.

Decisions of the Constitutional Review Court shall be subject to expedited appeal to the Supreme Court of the Republic.

The political question doctrine shall not apply.



(i) Legislative Termination

The Legislature may terminate an emergency declaration at any time by simple majority vote of each chamber.

Termination shall be immediate and binding.



(j) Popular Termination

The People retain ultimate authority to terminate emergency powers.

Upon:
	1.	petition by twenty percent (20%) of Civic Citizens; and
	2.	approval by two-thirds (2/3) of Civic Citizens voting,

the emergency declaration and all emergency orders shall cease within seventy-two (72) hours.

Interference with this process constitutes constitutional malfeasance.



(k) Martial Law

Martial law may be imposed only where civilian courts are incapable of functioning and only upon:
	1.	certification by the Supreme Court; and
	2.	approval by the Legislature.

Martial law:
	•	shall not exceed fourteen (14) days;
	•	may be renewed once by two-thirds legislative vote; and
	•	shall never suspend constitutional rights or civilian judicial authority.



(l) Transparency and Recordkeeping

All emergency actions shall be:
	1.	logged contemporaneously;
	2.	archived publicly; and
	3.	subject to disclosure under this Constitution.

Secret emergency law is prohibited.



(m) No Emergency Laundering

Emergency powers shall not be used to:
	1.	entrench officeholders;
	2.	evade constitutional limits;
	3.	suppress lawful political opposition; or
	4.	create precedent for ordinary governance.

Emergency authority expires with the emergency and creates no residual power.



(n) Accountability

Knowingly issuing or enforcing emergency actions beyond the limits of this Section constitutes constitutional malfeasance and shall trigger mandatory referral under Section 6.


Section 8 — Pardons and Clemency

(a) Limited Clemency Authority

The President may grant pardons or commutations only for offenses defined by statute, subject to the limits of this Constitution.

Clemency is an act of mercy, not an act of governance.



(b) No Pardon for Constitutional Offenses

No pardon, commutation, or clemency may be granted for:
	1.	constitutional malfeasance;
	2.	abuse of executive authority;
	3.	obstruction of constitutional oversight;
	4.	retaliation against whistleblowers or witnesses; or
	5.	offenses arising from efforts to evade constitutional accountability.



(c) No Self-Pardon

No person may pardon or commute offenses committed by themselves.

Any attempt to do so is void.



(d) No Pardon for Co-Conspirators

No pardon or commutation may be granted to:
	1.	co-conspirators;
	2.	accomplices;
	3.	subordinates acting under unlawful orders; or
	4.	any person whose offense materially implicates the President,

where such grant would impair investigation, accountability, or judicial process.



(e) No Emergency Clemency

Clemency powers shall not be exercised:
	1.	during a declared emergency; or
	2.	for offenses arising from or connected to emergency actions,

until all emergency powers have expired and judicial review is complete.



(f) Transparency Requirement

All grants of pardon or commutation shall:
	1.	be issued in writing;
	2.	state the specific offense(s) covered;
	3.	include a public statement of reasons; and
	4.	be entered into a permanent public record.

Secret or undisclosed clemency is prohibited.



(g) No Erasure of Facts

A pardon or commutation:
	1.	shall not expunge records;
	2.	shall not erase findings of fact;
	3.	shall not bar civil liability; and
	4.	shall not preclude impeachment, removal, or professional discipline.



(h) Timing Restrictions

No pardon or commutation may be granted:
	1.	after formal charges are filed against the President;
	2.	after initiation of removal proceedings; or
	3.	within the final ninety (90) days of a presidential term,

except upon certification by the Constitutional Review Court, subject to appellate review by the Supreme Court of the Republic.



(i) Judicial Review

The Constitutional Review Court shall have mandatory jurisdiction to review:
	1.	the constitutional validity of any clemency grant; and
	2.	compliance with the requirements of this Section.

The political question doctrine shall not apply.



(j) Void Grants

Any clemency grant issued in violation of this Section is void ab initio and without legal effect.



(k) Accountability

Knowingly issuing or enforcing an unlawful clemency grant constitutes constitutional malfeasance and shall trigger mandatory referral under Section 6.



Section 9 — Transparency, Classification, and Whistleblowers

(a) No Secret Law

No executive action may bind, coerce, penalize, or deprive any person absent a publicly accessible statement of lawful authority.

Classified legal interpretations, secret directives, or undisclosed policies shall have no force against the People.



(b) Classification Authority Limited

Information may be classified only to protect legitimate national security interests and only to the minimum extent necessary.

Classification shall not be used to:
	1.	conceal illegality or constitutional violations;
	2.	evade oversight or judicial review;
	3.	suppress political accountability; or
	4.	prevent lawful disclosure of wrongdoing.



(c) Maximum Duration of Classification

No record, directive, or information may remain classified beyond twenty-five (25) years, unless extended in accordance with subsection (d).

Automatic declassification shall occur upon expiration.



(d) Extension of Classification
Classification may be extended only upon joint approval of:
	1.	a select national security committee composed of no fewer than ten (10) members of each chamber of the Legislature;
	2.	the Constitutional Review Court, by written order finding that continued secrecy satisfies constitutional standards; and
	3.	the Constitutional Judicial Commission, which shall certify that the request is not motivated by institutional self-protection, political embarrassment, concealment of wrongdoing, or capture.

Each extension may not exceed five (5) years.


(e) Public Override of Classification

Any classified record may be declassified upon:
	1.	petition by ten percent (10%) of Civic Citizens; and
	2.	approval by sixty percent (60%) of Civic Citizens voting.

Declassification pursuant to this subsection shall occur within seventy-two (72) hours of certification.



(f) Judicial Access

No claim of classification, executive privilege, or national security shall bar courts from access to evidence necessary to adjudicate constitutional claims.

Courts shall employ secure procedures to review sensitive material without foreclosing accountability.



(g) Whistleblower Protections

Any person who discloses, through protected channels, credible evidence of:
	1.	illegality;
	2.	constitutional violation;
	3.	abuse of authority;
	4.	fraud or corruption; or
	5.	obstruction of oversight

is protected under this Constitution.



(h) Protected Channels

Protected disclosures may be made to:
	1.	an Inspector General;
	2.	a Special Prosecutor;
	3.	a court under seal;
	4.	designated legislative committees; or
	5.	the Constitutional Judicial Commission.



(i) Anti-Retaliation Rule

Any adverse action taken within two (2) years of a protected disclosure is presumed retaliatory unless the government proves legitimate cause by clear and convincing evidence.

Retaliation constitutes constitutional malfeasance.



(j) Remedies

Whistleblowers subjected to retaliation are entitled to:
	1.	immediate injunctive relief;
	2.	reinstatement;
	3.	back pay with interest;
	4.	treble damages; and
	5.	reasonable attorney fees and costs.



(k) Classification Is No Defense

Classification shall not bar whistleblower protection, judicial review, or enforcement of constitutional rights.

Knowingly classifying information to conceal wrongdoing constitutes constitutional malfeasance.



(l) Accountability

Violation of this Section, including unlawful classification or retaliation, shall trigger mandatory referral under Section 6.



Section 10 — Oaths, Civil–Military Subordination, and Continuity

(a) Oath of Constitutional Fidelity

The President and all executive officers shall swear an oath to support and defend this Constitution.

The oath is a binding legal obligation, not a ceremonial act.



(b) Supremacy of Constitutional Duty

The duty to uphold this Constitution supersedes all other obligations, including:
	1.	loyalty to officeholders;
	2.	obedience to superior orders;
	3.	partisan allegiance; and
	4.	claims of necessity or expediency.

No order inconsistent with this Constitution is lawful.



(c) Duty to Refuse Unconstitutional Orders

No executive officer, employee, or agent shall obey an order that is unconstitutional on its face or whose unconstitutionality is reasonably apparent.

Compliance with unlawful orders does not excuse liability once the violation is known or should have been known.



(d) Civilian Control of the Military

The military shall remain strictly subordinate to civilian constitutional authority.

No military force shall be deployed domestically except as expressly authorized by this Constitution and subject to civilian judicial oversight.



(e) No Political Use of Armed Forces

Armed forces shall not be used to:
	1.	influence elections;
	2.	suppress lawful political activity;
	3.	enforce partisan objectives; or
	4.	entrench executive authority.

Orders to do so are unlawful.



(f) Continuity of Government

Continuity of government exists solely to preserve constitutional order during temporary disruption.

Continuity procedures shall:
	1.	preserve separation of powers;
	2.	maintain judicial review;
	3.	protect constitutional rights; and
	4.	expire automatically upon restoration of normal conditions.



(g) No Continuity Laundering

Continuity mechanisms shall not be used to:
	1.	suspend constitutional rights;
	2.	concentrate power in the Executive;
	3.	bypass legislative or judicial authority; or
	4.	operate secret governance structures.

Any such use is void.



(h) Transparency of Continuity Measures

All continuity plans, authorities, and directives shall be:
	1.	publicly disclosed; and
	2.	subject to legislative and judicial oversight,

except for narrow redactions strictly necessary for immediate security.

Secret continuity law is prohibited.

The Constitutional Review Court shall have mandatory jurisdiction to review:
	1.	the legality of any continuity measure;
	2.	compliance with this Section; and
	3.	claims of constitutional suspension.

The political question doctrine shall not apply.



(j) Accountability

Knowingly violating this Section constitutes constitutional malfeasance and shall trigger mandatory referral under Section 6.

No doctrine of necessity, emergency, war, or survival shall override its limits.


Section 11. Executive–Treasury Boundary

(a) The Treasury of the Republic is an Executive Department but shall operate as a fiduciary steward bound strictly by this Constitution and by law, not as an instrument of presidential discretion.

(b) The President shall exercise no independent monetary authority, including but not limited to:
	1.	issuance or debasement of currency;
	2.	alteration of monetary supply;

Article L — Transitional and Implementation Provisions

Section 1. Continuity of Law and Governance
Upon ratification of this Constitution, all existing laws, regulations, offices, courts, and governmental actions shall remain in force to the extent they do not conflict with this Constitution, until amended, repealed, or replaced in accordance herewith.

No existing authority shall acquire new powers by virtue of this transition.

Section 2. Immediate Supremacy and Judicial Review
This Constitution shall take immediate effect upon ratification.

Any law, order, regulation, or governmental action inconsistent with this Constitution shall be void to the extent of such inconsistency.

Courts and review bodies shall give priority to resolving constitutional conflicts arising during the transition, subject to the default-to-liberty and anti-paralysis rules of Article 0.

Section 3. Provisional Operation of Institutions
Where this Constitution establishes new courts, commissions, or offices, such bodies shall be constituted as expeditiously as practicable.

Until formally constituted:
	•	essential review functions shall be exercised by existing courts of general jurisdiction,
	•	subject to the limits, timelines, and liberty-preserving rules of this Constitution.

No provisional body may claim permanence or authority beyond this Section.

Section 4. Timetable for Institutional Formation

Incumbent officeholders shall serve only in a caretaker capacity until successors are selected under this Constitution, and shall not exercise extraordinary, emergency, or expansionary powers during the transition absent express authorization herein.

Section 6. Emergency Powers During Transition
No emergency, continuity, or necessity doctrine may be invoked solely by reason of transition.

Any invocation of emergency authority during the transition shall comply fully with Articles XLVI and XLVI-A, and shall not be justified by institutional incompleteness, administrative inconvenience, or uncertainty.

Section 7. Sunset of Transitional Authority
All transitional authorities, provisional arrangements, and caretaker powers shall expire automatically one year after ratification, unless expressly continued by constitutional amendment.

Upon expiration, full constitutional order shall be deemed restored, and no transitional justification shall have legal force.

Section 8. Grandfathering of Prior Public Service and Citizenship Qualifications

During the transitional period, public service rendered in good faith to a prior sovereign state or lawful government shall be recognized, for purposes of citizenship qualification, civic service credit, and eligibility under this Constitution, as equivalent to comparable service rendered to the Republic, provided that the individual poses no significant security threat.

Such recognized service may include, but is not limited to:
	•	military service,
	•	civil defense or emergency service,
	•	law enforcement service,
	•	public health service,
	•	or other lawful governmental service performed under a recognized authority.

Recognition under this Section shall apply only where:
	1.	the service was lawful under the authority then governing;
	2.	the individual did not knowingly participate in war crimes, crimes against humanity, or grave violations of fundamental rights;
	3.	the individual affirms allegiance to this Constitution and renounces any incompatible sovereign obligation; and
	4.	competent authorities determine, through a fair and timely process, that the individual does not present a material threat to the security or constitutional order of the Republic.

No person shall be denied recognition solely on the basis of nationality, former citizenship, or service to an allied, neutral, or successor state.

Recognition of prior service under this Section:
	•	shall not confer immunity for unlawful acts;
	•	shall not excuse misconduct reviewable under this Constitution; and
	•	shall not create entitlement to office, rank, or command absent compliance with the ordinary requirements of this Constitution.

This Section shall be construed liberally in favor of continuity, fairness, and social stability during transition, while preserving the Republic’s right to exclude persons who pose a demonstrable threat.

Section 9. Transitional Constitutional Review and Normalization

During the transitional period, the Constitutional Review Court (CRC) shall have primary jurisdiction to review, certify, harmonize, or invalidate preexisting laws, regulations, and governmental actions for conformity with this Constitution.

To prevent paralysis, backlog, or indefinite delay during transition:
	•	Priority Review.
All constitutional questions arising from preexisting law shall receive priority review, subject to the default-to-liberty, anti-paralysis, and time-limit rules of Article 0.
	•	Temporary Expansion of Review Capacity.
For the duration of the transition only, the CRC may be augmented by a Temporary Constitutional Review Panel (“Super CRC”), constituted solely for the purpose of expediting normalization of legacy law.
	•	Composition and Limits.
The Temporary Constitutional Review Panel shall:
	•	consist of additional judges or jurists meeting the qualifications for CRC service;
	•	operate under the same ethical, procedural, transparency, and conflict-of-interest rules as the CRC;
	•	possess no authority beyond constitutional conformity review; and
	•	dissolve automatically upon expiration of the transitional period.
	•	Authority and Effect.
Decisions of the Temporary Constitutional Review Panel shall have the same legal force as CRC decisions, subject to consolidation, rehearing, or reversal by the full CRC in accordance with this Constitution.
	•	No Emergency Bypass.
The existence of transitional backlog, institutional incompleteness, or administrative burden shall not justify bypassing CRC review, invoking emergency authority, or suspending constitutional safeguards.
	•	Sunset.
All temporary review authority under this Section shall expire automatically at the conclusion of the transitional period, and no such authority may be renewed except by constitutional amendment.
Section 9-A. Prioritization and Public Triage

During the transitional period, the CRC shall operate a published triage system for normalization of legacy laws, regulations, and governmental actions.

(a) Categories.
Reviews shall be classified and processed by urgency:
1. High Priority: matters affecting life, liberty, bodily autonomy, property, due process, speech, association, surveillance, emergency powers, or any LOCK-protected provision.
2. Medium Priority: structural, fiscal, institutional, or economic measures with substantial public impact.
3. Low Priority: administrative or procedural provisions with minimal rights impact.

(b) Transparency.
The CRC shall publish triage criteria, workload statistics, and progress reports at least annually, subject only to narrow operational redactions.

Section 9-B. Temporary Scaling and Delegation

(a) Super CRC Confirmation.
The Temporary Constitutional Review Panel (“Super CRC”) may be used to expedite normalization and shall dissolve automatically at the end of transition.

(b) Size Cap and Sunset.
The Super CRC shall not exceed double the ordinary CRC review capacity and shall sunset earlier if backlog falls below a statutory threshold.

(c) Delegation of Low-Priority Matters.
Low-priority legacy reviews may be delegated to State Supreme Courts under CRC-issued standards, with CRC oversight and final review available upon petition or contest.

Section 9-C. Optional AI-Assisted Triage

Audited artificial systems may be used only to assist screening, sorting, and conflict-flagging of legacy laws.
No artificial system may issue binding decisions, certify constitutionality, or substitute for human judicial judgment.
All dispositive actions shall be made by human judges or jurists subject to the ordinary rules of this Constitution.

Section 9-D. Timelines and Default Rule for Legacy Enforcement

(a) Review Deadlines.
Legacy matters shall be resolved within:
1. two (2) years for High Priority;
2. five (5) years for Medium Priority;
3. such longer period as law may allow for Low Priority, provided that no Low Priority provision may be used to burden LOCK-protected rights during delay.

(b) Default-to-Liberty for Legacy Law.
If a legacy law burdens a LOCK-protected right or core structural safeguard and is not certified for conformity within the applicable deadline, it becomes unenforceable upon expiration of that deadline until and unless the CRC certifies conformity.

(c) Evidence Capture Protected.
Nothing in this Section shall criminalize or suppress good-faith documentation of crime, abuse, or public corruption, including capture and submission of evidentiary material, subject to narrow victim-protection and access-control rules.

Section 10. Interpretation
This Article shall be interpreted narrowly.

Its sole purpose is to enable orderly transition into constitutional governance, not to authorize deviation from it.

The purpose of the Constitutional Review Court is to provide disciplined, neutral, and authoritative review of constitutional questions, to ensure uniform interpretation of this Constitution, and to prevent constitutional drift, fragmentation, or abuse by any branch of government.

The Constitutional Review Court exists to safeguard constitutional structure, not to govern.

The Constitutional Review Court exercises judicial power and shall adjudicate cases within its jurisdiction and issue binding judgments on the merits, subject to the limits and review provisions of this Constitution.

⸻

Section 2. Composition

The Constitutional Review Court shall consist of nine (9) judges.

Judges of the Constitutional Review Court shall meet the same constitutional qualifications as judges of the Supreme Court, unless otherwise specified by this Constitution.

The Court shall sit en banc unless otherwise authorized by this Constitution.

⸻

Section 3. Jurisdiction

The Constitutional Review Court shall have jurisdiction limited to:
	1.	review of the constitutionality of statutes, executive actions, regulations, and governmental structures;
	2.	resolution of conflicts concerning the separation of powers;
	3.	review of laws or actions alleged to violate express constitutional prohibitions;

⸻

Section 7. Relationship to the Supreme Court of the Republic

(a) Distinct Jurisdictional Roles
The Constitutional Review Court exercises original jurisdiction over constitutional compliance, validity, and legal effect of matters expressly assigned to it by this Constitution, including matters routed through the Constitutional Judicial Commission. The Supreme Court of the Republic serves as the court of last resort and retains ultimate appellate and precedential authority.

(b) Appellate Review
Final judgments and orders of the Constitutional Review Court are subject to appellate or discretionary review by the Supreme Court of the Republic as provided by this Constitution. The Supreme Court may affirm, reverse, remand, or modify such determinations, but shall not exercise original jurisdiction over matters assigned in the first instance to the Constitutional Review Court except where expressly authorized herein. A judgment of the Constitutional Review Court shall be final if the Supreme Court declines review.

Where the Supreme Court is evenly divided, the CRC judgment shall stand as binding disposition of the constitutional question presented, but shall not create Supreme Court precedent.

(c) No Advisory or Subordinate Function
The Constitutional Review Court does not act in an advisory capacity to the Supreme Court, nor does it issue opinions by referral for the purpose of assisting Supreme Court deliberation. Each court shall exercise its own constitutionally assigned jurisdiction independently and without subordination, subject only to the appellate authority of the Supreme Court as provided herein.

(d) Referral from Other Courts
Lower courts of the Republic shall refer questions of constitutional compliance, validity, or enforceability to the Constitutional Review Court where this Constitution so requires. Such referrals do not divest the Supreme Court of appellate jurisdiction over the resulting determination.

(e) Precedential Effect
Decisions of the Supreme Court of the Republic constitute binding constitutional precedent. Decisions of the Constitutional Review Court carry binding effect unless and until modified or reversed by the Supreme Court.

(f) Construction
This Section shall be construed to prevent jurisdictional overlap, advisory adjudication, or forum shopping, and to preserve a clear sequence of original constitutional adjudication followed by appellate review.

(g) Complexity Certification

The Constitutional Review Court may certify that a matter presents complexity, novelty, or institutional consequence requiring appellate consideration. Upon such certification, Supreme Court review shall be mandatory.


⸻

Section 8. Standing and Procedure

Standing before the Constitutional Review Court shall be limited to questions of constitutional compliance and shall not expand access beyond that permitted by Article VI-A.

Proceedings of the Constitutional Review Court shall be:
	1.	adversarial where appropriate;

Section 9A. Institutional Integrity of the Constitutional Review Court
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have independent and continuing authority to investigate, audit, and certify whether the Constitutional Review Court is subject to corruption, capture, coercion, improper influence, or structural impairment.

Where the CJC finds credible evidence of such impairment, it shall issue a public certification and refer the matter to the Judicial Review Board and to the Legislature for corrective action.

The CJC shall not review the substance of constitutional rulings, but shall safeguard the Court’s independence, honesty, and constitutional fitness.

Section 4. Narrow and Time-Limited Sealing

Judicial records or proceedings may be sealed only upon a written finding, supported by clear and convincing evidence, that:

Article VI-G — Jury Doctrine

Section 1. Constitutional Status of the Jury

The jury is a constitutional institution of the Republic and a direct instrument of popular sovereignty in the administration of justice.

In criminal cases, the jury stands as an independent check upon the State, empowered to protect liberty against unjust accusation, prosecution, or law.

⸻

Section 2. Authority Over Law and Fact

In criminal cases, the jury possesses the authority to judge both the facts and the application of the law to those facts.

No court shall instruct a jury that it is bound to convict upon a particular interpretation of the law.

No verdict of acquittal shall be set aside, reviewed, or questioned on the ground that the jury disagreed with the law, its application, or its justice.

⸻

Section 3. Prohibition on Coercion and Punishment

No juror shall be punished, sanctioned, investigated, fined, imprisoned, or otherwise penalized for:
	1.	the verdict rendered;
	2.	the reasoning employed in reaching a verdict;
	3.	refusal to convict in a criminal case.

Inquiry into jury deliberations for the purpose of punishing jurors or impeaching a verdict is prohibited.

⸻

Section 4. Limits on Judicial Control

Judges shall not:
	1.	direct a verdict of guilty;
	2.	override or vacate a verdict of acquittal;
	3.	coerce unanimity through threats, sanctions, or improper instructions;
	4.	impose instructions designed to nullify the jury’s constitutional authority.

Judicial instructions shall explain the law but shall not compel a particular outcome.

⸻

Section 5. Hung Juries and Mistrials

Where a jury cannot reach unanimity in a criminal case, the court may declare a mistrial.

No adverse inference shall be drawn against the accused from a hung jury.

Repeated prosecutions following mistrial shall be subject to judicial scrutiny to prevent harassment or coercive retrial.

⸻

Section 6. Civil Juries

In civil cases, the jury shall determine questions of fact.

No court shall override a civil jury’s factual findings except where constitutionally authorized.

The Legislature may regulate civil jury practice by law, provided that such regulation does not impair the essential function of the jury as a finder of fact.

⸻

Section 7. Jury Independence and Composition

Juries shall be drawn from the People and shall represent a fair cross-section of the community.

No jury shall be selected, excluded, or shaped to secure a particular verdict.

Jurors shall be free from intimidation, surveillance, or retaliation by the State or private parties.

⸻

Section 8. Relationship to Artificial Intelligence

	1.	influence jury deliberations;
	2.	assess juror credibility or behavior;
	3.	recommend or predict jury outcomes;
	4.	substitute for jury judgment.

Any verdict influenced by prohibited use of artificial systems is void.

Article VI-H — Constitutional Deadlock and Popular Referendum

Section 1. Purpose and Extraordinary Nature

This Subarticle establishes a limited mechanism for resolving genuine constitutional deadlock where the ordinary processes of adjudication cannot yield a determinate outcome.

The popular referendum authorized by this Subarticle is extraordinary, subsidiary to judicial review, and shall not be employed as a routine instrument of governance.

⸻

Section 2. Definition of Constitutional Deadlock

A constitutional deadlock exists only where all of the following conditions are met:
	1.	a substantial question of constitutional interpretation is dispositive of a matter of national scope;
	2.	the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Review Court have rendered final decisions that are irreconcilably divided or incapable of producing a binding constitutional rule;
	3.	no further judicial remedy or clarification is available within the Judiciary;
	4.	continued uncertainty materially impairs the operation of the Republic or the equal application of constitutional rights.

Mere disagreement, dissent, delay, or political controversy shall not constitute deadlock.
For purposes of this Section, “incapable of producing a binding constitutional rule” includes: an evenly divided court; lack of quorum; recusal or vacancy preventing formation of a controlling rule; or fractured opinions lacking any controlling rationale. A mere difference of reasoning does not constitute deadlock where a binding constitutional rule exists.

⸻

Section 3. Exhaustion of Judicial Remedies

No popular referendum may be initiated unless all judicial remedies have been fully exhausted.

Judicial exhaustion requires:
	1.	final disposition by the Supreme Court; and
	2.	final constitutional determination by the Constitutional Review Court under Article VI-B, Section 7, including Supreme Court opportunity for review and mandatory review where the CRC certifies appellate consideration is required, where jurisdiction exists.

Failure to pursue available judicial remedies bars invocation of this Subarticle.

Nothing in this Section prohibits resolution of a certified constitutional deadlock pursuant to Article VI-H; pending such resolution, the default-to-liberty rule governs.

⸻

Section 4. Certification of Deadlock

A declaration of constitutional deadlock shall require certification by:
(1)	 a supermajority of the Constitutional Review Court; and
(2) concurrence by a supermajority of the Supreme Court,
 that the criteria of Section 2 have been satisfied; and, 
(3) certification by the Constitutional Judicial Commission that no party, judge, or institution has engaged in coercion, capture, corruption, or strategic obstruction designed to manufacture or prolong the deadlock.

Absent such certification, no referendum may proceed.
“Supermajority” shall have the meaning given in Article 0 (Supermajority Rule) unless this Subarticle expressly provides otherwise.

⸻

Section 5. Scope and Form of Referendum

A referendum under this Subarticle shall be limited strictly to the constitutional question certified as deadlocked.

The question presented shall:
	1.	be stated neutrally and precisely;
	2.	present no more than two constitutionally permissible alternatives;
	3.	avoid partisan framing, legislative detail, or policy embellishment.

The referendum shall not amend this Constitution unless the amendment procedures of Article XV are separately satisfied.

⸻

Section 6. Effect of Referendum Outcome

The outcome of a referendum conducted pursuant to this Subarticle shall:

	1.	resolve the certified constitutional question;
	2.	bind all branches of government;
	3.	be applied prospectively unless otherwise required to prevent manifest injustice.

The referendum outcome shall not:
	1.	diminish enumerated rights;
	2.	suspend judicial review in future cases;
	3.	authorize retroactive punishment.

Threshold:
The certified constitutional question shall be resolved only upon a supermajority vote of participating Civic Citizens, as defined in Article 0, unless this Constitution expressly requires a higher threshold.

⸻

Section 7. Judicial Review of Process

Courts shall retain jurisdiction to review:
	1.	compliance with the requirements of this Subarticle;
	2.	the neutrality and clarity of the referendum question;
	3.	the integrity of the referendum process.

Courts shall not review the substantive choice made by the People where the process complies with this Constitution.

⸻

Section 8. Prohibitions and Safeguards

No referendum under this Subarticle may be used to:
	1.	target specific persons or groups;
	2.	override a final acquittal;
	3.	suspend due process;
	4.	evade constitutional rights;
	5.	resolve ordinary policy disputes.

Emergency, necessity, or expediency shall not justify deviation from these safeguards.

⸻

Section 9. Frequency and Non-Repetition

No substantially similar constitutional question may be submitted to referendum more than once within a defined period as provided by law, absent materially changed circumstances.

Rolling or repetitive referenda designed to exhaust or coerce the People are prohibited.

⸻

Section 10. Relationship to Other Articles

This Subarticle operates subject to Article XV.

Nothing herein shall be construed to diminish the authority of the Judiciary under Article VI, nor the rights secured by Article XXVI.

Election administration related to referenda shall comply with Article XVI.

⸻

Section 11. Interpretation

This Subarticle shall be interpreted narrowly, to preserve judicial independence while recognizing that ultimate constitutional sovereignty resides in the People.

Where doubt exists, the construction that favors judicial resolution over popular referendum shall control.

⸻

[LOCK DESIGNATION]

The following principles of this Subarticle are designated for lock protection and shall not be abridged except by explicit constitutional revision:
	1.	exhaustion of judicial remedies as a prerequisite;
	2.	dual-court certification of deadlock;
	3.	narrow scope and neutral framing of referendum questions;
	4.	prohibition on rights diminution or retroactive punishment;
	5.	judicial review of process integrity.

⸻

Article VI-I — Judicial Continuity and Emergency Function

Section 1. Purpose and Scope

This Subarticle establishes limited measures to preserve the continuous operation of the Judiciary during declared emergencies, catastrophic disruption, or temporary incapacity.

Judicial continuity exists to maintain constitutional adjudication, not to expand judicial authority or suspend rights.

⸻

Section 2. Constitutional Hierarchy

All continuity measures under this Subarticle operate subject to Article XV.

Nothing in this Subarticle shall authorize powers inconsistent with Article XV, Article XXXVI, or Article XXXVIII, according to their respective constitutional hierarchy.

Where a conflict is alleged, the construction that most restricts emergency authority shall control.

⸻

Section 3. Preservation of Judicial Review

At all times, including during emergencies:
	1.	access to courts shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable;
	2.	habeas corpus and core constitutional review shall not be suspended except as expressly permitted by this Constitution;
	3.	judicial independence and due process shall remain operative.

Emergency conditions shall not justify denial of judicial review.

⸻

Section 4. Temporary Operational Adjustments

During a declared emergency, courts may adopt temporary operational measures, including:
	1.	modified scheduling;
	2.	alternate locations;
	3.	remote proceedings where constitutionally permissible;
	4.	temporary reassignment of judges within existing courts.

Such measures shall be procedural only and shall not alter jurisdiction, remedies, or substantive rights.

⸻

Section 5. Prohibition on Emergency Courts and Extraordinary Tribunals

No emergency, provisional, or special tribunal shall be created outside the judicial structure established by this Constitution.

No court shall be vested with expanded jurisdiction, secrecy, or authority by virtue of an emergency.

Secret courts, secret law, or undisclosed adjudicatory bodies are prohibited.

⸻

Section 6. Non-Expansion and Anti-Laundering

Emergency or continuity measures shall not be used to:
	1.	expand judicial power;
	2.	consolidate authority;
	3.	bypass ordinary appointment, ethics, or removal requirements;
	4.	evade transparency or record-preservation obligations.

Any measure that persists beyond the termination of the emergency is void.


Section 7. Duration and Automatic Sunset

All continuity measures shall:
	1.	be expressly time-limited;
	2.	terminate automatically upon the expiration of the declared emergency;
	3.	be subject to periodic review where continued necessity is asserted.

Continuation without fresh authorization consistent with Article XV is prohibited.

Section 8. Transparency and Records

All actions taken pursuant to this Subarticle shall be documented and preserved as public records.

Emergency proceedings, orders, and administrative measures shall be disclosed promptly upon restoration of normal operations, subject only to narrow, time-limited protections consistent with Article VI-E and Article XXXIX.


Section 8A. Emergency Integrity Oversight

During any declared emergency, the Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have full authority to audit, inspect, and monitor all judicial continuity measures, emergency procedures, sealed proceedings, and continuity records.

Any concealment, obstruction, or abuse of emergency authority shall be immediately certified to the Constitutional Review Court and the Judicial Review Board.

Section 9. Accountability

Judicial officers and administrators who knowingly exceed the authority granted by this Subarticle shall be subject to discipline, removal, and liability as provided by this Constitution.

No immunity shall attach to intentional violations of continuity constraints.



Section 10. Interpretation

This Subarticle shall be interpreted to ensure that emergencies do not become a pretext for secrecy, exceptional justice, or permanent alteration of the judicial order.

The Judiciary shall remain a court of law, not a court of emergency.

⸻

Article VII — Crime, Justice, and Penal Philosophy

Charge
This Article establishes the constitutional framework governing criminal liability, adjudication, punishment, and penal restraint within the Republic. All provisions of this Article shall be construed to ensure legality, proportionality, due process, and restraint in the exercise of the State’s punitive power. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to authorize punishment, detention, or coercive sanction except as expressly provided by law and consistent with constitutional safeguards.

Section 1. Purpose of Criminal Law

a. Protection of the Innocent
The foremost purpose of criminal law is the protection of innocent persons from violence, coercion, exploitation, and fraud.

No legal theory, procedure, or ideology may supersede this duty.

b. Preservation of Public Order
Criminal law exists to preserve public order so that liberty may exist without fear.
Lawlessness is not freedom; it is the abdication of justice.

c. Accountability for Harm
Crime is defined by harm done, not merely by rule violation.
Where harm exists, accountability must follow.

d. Restoration Where Possible
Where crimes admit of repair, the justice system shall prioritize:
	•	restitution to victims;
	•	restoration of property and opportunity;
	•	repair of social trust.

Where harm is reparable, restitution to the injured party shall take precedence over punitive confinement, except where confinement is necessary for public safety.

e. Incapacitation Where Necessary
Where an offender poses a continuing danger, removal from society is justified to protect life and order.

The safety of the many outweighs the comfort of the irredeemable.

f. Moral Clarity
The law shall distinguish clearly between:
	•	accident and intent,
	•	weakness and malice,
	•	error and predation.

Justice fails when it refuses to name evil.

g. Rejection of Legal Formalism as Escape
No person guilty of heinous crimes—including murder, rape, sexual exploitation, trafficking, or severe violence—shall escape accountability solely due to procedural defects.

Procedural violations by officials shall be punished separately and severely,
but truthfully obtained evidence of grave crimes remains admissible.

Justice shall not sacrifice the innocent to preserve technical purity.

h. Equal Obligation Under Law
All persons—citizens and lawful residents alike—are equally bound by criminal law and equally entitled to its protections.

No caste, office, ideology, or status grants immunity from accountability.

i. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to ensure that criminal law serves truth, safety, and justice—
not ideology, convenience, or abstraction.

As Scripture teaches:
“Justice, justice shall you pursue.”
Section 2. The Three Tiers of Justice

a. Principle of Differentiated Justice
Justice shall be administered according to the nature of the offender, the degree of harm caused, and the likelihood of rehabilitation.

The Republic rejects both indiscriminate punishment and indiscriminate leniency.

Accordingly, criminal justice shall be structured into three distinct tiers.

b. Tier One: Therapeutic Justice (Rehabilitation Without Incarceration)
Tier One applies to offenders whose conduct arises primarily from:
	•	substance addiction;
	•	mental illness;
	•	psychological impairment;
	•	developmental incapacity;
	•	situational crisis;

and who do not pose a continuing threat of violence or predation.

Measures under Tier One may include:
	•	mandatory treatment or detoxification;
	•	psychiatric or psychological care;
	•	supervised community programs;
	•	vocational training;
	•	restorative justice processes;
	•	monitored reintegration.

Tier One exists to heal, not to punish.

Failure to comply with Tier One requirements shall result in escalation to Tier Two.

c. Completion and Finality of Tier One Dispositions
Completion of all court-ordered requirements under Tier One constitutes full satisfaction of criminal liability for the offense.

No further punishment, disability, or collateral consequence may be imposed upon completion.

Time served is time served.

d. Sealing of Tier One Records
Records of Tier One offenses shall be:
	•	sealed from public access;
	•	unavailable to employers, landlords, insurers, or private parties;
	•	accessible only to courts and law enforcement for limited judicial purposes.

Tier One records may not be used to:
	•	deny employment;
	•	deny housing;
	•	deny education;
	•	impose civil penalties;
	•	justify enhanced sentencing for unrelated offenses.

e. Protection Against Recriminalization
No person who has successfully completed Tier One requirements shall be subjected to conditions or restrictions that:
	•	foreseeably push them toward recidivism;
	•	function as de facto punishment;
	•	undermine rehabilitation.

The Republic shall not sabotage its own justice.

f. Tier Two: Rehabilitative Incarceration
Tier Two applies to offenders who:
	•	commit serious crimes;
	•	demonstrate willful wrongdoing;
	•	require confinement for public safety;
but who retain a reasonable prospect of reform.

Confinement under Tier Two shall:
	•	be secure and disciplined;
	•	require labor, education, or training;
	•	prioritize restitution to victims;
	•	provide moral, psychological, and vocational rehabilitation;
	•	condition privileges and release upon demonstrated reform.

Comfort is not the aim; correction is.

g. Tier Three: Punitive Incapacitation
Tier Three applies exclusively to offenders who are:
	•	convicted of heinous crimes, including murder, rape, child sexual exploitation, trafficking, or acts of extreme violence;
	•	repeat violent offenders demonstrating incorrigibility;
	•	demonstrably unrepentant, predatory, or irreversibly dangerous.

Tier Three confinement shall:
	•	prioritize permanent protection of society;
	•	impose harsh and demanding conditions proportional to the offense;
	•	deny privileges unrelated to basic human survival;
	•	require compulsory labor where physically possible;
	•	exclude early release except under extraordinary judicial review.

This tier exists not to rehabilitate, but to restrain and punish.

Conditions shall be harsh but not cruel.

h. Prohibition on Tier Conflation
No authority may:
	•	treat Tier Three offenders as candidates for routine leniency;
	•	impose Tier Three conditions on Tier One offenders;
	•	collapse all offenders into a single penal model.

Justice requires distinction.

i. Review and Movement Between Tiers
Movement between tiers may occur only:
	•	by judicial review;
	•	upon clear evidence of change or deterioration;
	•	with victim input considered where applicable.

Escalation is permitted for noncompliance, deception, or new offenses.

De-escalation requires sustained proof of reform.

j. Moral Foundation
Mercy is owed to the repentant.
Correction is owed to the errant.
Severity is owed to the wicked.

The Republic shall not confuse these duties.

k. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to preserve moral clarity, protect the innocent, and ensure that justice remains humane without becoming weak, and severe without becoming cruel.

As Scripture teaches:
“The rod and reproof give wisdom, but a child left to himself brings shame.”

Section 2A. Cross-Reference: Structural and Institutional Crimes

a. Constitutional Escalation
Any act declared a grave offense under:
	•	Corporate Legitimacy and Accountability;
	•	Knowledge, Technology, and the Digital Commons;
	•	Transparency, Anti-Capture, and Public Stewardship;

shall, when committed with intent, coordination, or systemic scale, qualify as a Tier Three crime under this Article.

b. Institutional Malice
Where harm arises not from isolated conduct but from organized systems, policies, technologies, or corporate structures, culpability shall extend to:
	•	architects of the system;
	•	beneficiaries of the harm;
	•	enforcers and facilitators;
	•	those who knowingly conceal, excuse, or profit from the offense.

c. No Shield of Abstraction
Corporate form, algorithmic mediation, financial instruments, bureaucratic distance, or institutional layering shall not mitigate criminal liability.

Structural harm is personal harm at scale.

Section 2B. Classification of Offenses
 Offenses shall be classified as: 
	•	Tier One (minor): Non-violent, low-harm conduct; punishments limited to fines, community service, or short-term restrictions. 

	•	Tier Two (serious): Conduct involving moderate violence, fraud, or harm; punishments may include incarceration up to 10 years, restitution, and supervised release. 


	•	Tier Three / Grave (heinous): As defined in Article 0; punishments may include lifetime confinement, mandatory labor under humane standards, permanent forfeiture of certain rights (subject to due process review), or, in extraordinary cases involving mass death or betrayal resulting in irreparable harm, capital punishment (subject to unanimous jury finding, multiple layers of review, and preference for lifetime incapacitation absent clear necessity).

	•	All classifications and punishments must be proportionate, evidence-based, and subject to appellate review.

Section 2C. Temporary Protective Measures for Imminent Threats
 Where clear and convincing evidence establishes an Imminent Threat of Grave Harm (as defined in Article 0), courts may issue temporary orders restricting access to firearms, liberty of movement, or other means of harm (e.g., extreme risk protection orders). Such orders shall: 

	•	Be strictly time-limited (initially not exceeding 14–30 days); 
	•	Require an adversarial hearing within 72 hours where feasible; 
	•	Include a clear pathway for immediate restoration upon cessation of the threat; 
	•	Be narrowly tailored and subject to expedited appeal; 
	•	Never become permanent absent full due process under Section 5 of Article II. These measures are civil in nature and do not constitute punishment.


Section 3. Standards of Guilt, Evidence, and Truth

a. Presumption of Innocence
Every accused person is presumed innocent until guilt is established through lawful adjudication.

This presumption protects the innocent; it shall not be weaponized to shield the guilty through deception, intimidation, or technical gamesmanship.

b. Burden of Proof
The burden of proof rests entirely upon the prosecuting authority.

Guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt for criminal conviction.

Reasonable doubt concerns truth and material facts, not speculative, manufactured, or ideological uncertainty.

c. Mens Rea (State of Mind)
Criminal liability shall account for intent and mental state.

The law shall distinguish among:
	•	intentional acts;
	•	knowing acts;
	•	reckless acts;
	•	negligent acts;
	•	accidental acts.

Punishment must be proportionate to both harm and intent.

d. Admissibility of Evidence
All evidence that is:
	•	materially relevant;
	•	reliable;
	•	probative of truth;

shall be admissible, regardless of how it was obtained, provided that its authenticity and accuracy are established.

Procedural violations in evidence collection shall not invalidate truthful proof of grave crimes.

e. Separate Accountability for Official Misconduct
Any official who unlawfully obtains evidence shall be:
	•	prosecuted independently;
	•	subject to severe penalties;
	•	barred from office where appropriate.

Justice shall punish wrongdoing without nullifying truth.

f. Exclusion of Fabricated or Coerced Evidence
Evidence shall be excluded if it is:
	•	fabricated;
	•	materially altered;
	•	knowingly falsified;
	•	proven to be unreliable;
	•	obtained through coercion rendering it untruthful.

Truth is not served by lies, even in pursuit of justice.

g. Corroboration for Extraordinary Claims
Extraordinary accusations shall require corroboration proportional to the severity of the charge.

No person shall be convicted solely on the basis of:
	•	uncorroborated hearsay;
	•	speculative inference;
	•	ideological presumption;
	•	collective guilt;
	•	demographic assumption.

Justice demands proof, not narratives.

h. Confessions and Admissions
Confessions are admissible only if:
	•	voluntarily given;
	•	corroborated by independent evidence;
	•	not induced by coercion, torture, or threat.

Truth extracted through cruelty is unreliable and forbidden.

i. Scientific and Technical Evidence
Scientific, forensic, or technical evidence must:
	•	meet established standards of reliability;
	•	be subject to independent verification;
	•	be transparent and reproducible;
	•	disclose error rates and limitations.

Pseudo-science and politicized expertise are inadmissible.

j. Truth-Seeking Authority of the Court
Judges possess affirmative authority to:
	•	question evidence;
	•	seek clarification;
	•	order independent testing;
	•	require additional proof;
	•	reject narratives unsupported by fact.

The court exists to discover truth, not to referee performances.

k. Jury Integrity
Juries shall be composed of impartial peers.

No juror may be selected or excluded on ideological, racial, religious, or political grounds.

Jury tampering, intimidation, or manipulation constitutes a grave offense.

l. Verdict Integrity
Verdicts must reflect:
	•	evidence presented;
	•	lawful instructions;
	•	rational deliberation.

Nullification motivated by ideology, intimidation, or coercion is forbidden.

m. Appeals
Appeals shall address:
	•	material errors of law;
	•	demonstrable factual error;
	•	newly discovered evidence;
	•	constitutional violations affecting outcome.

Appeals shall not be granted for harmless procedural defects that do not affect guilt.

n. Finality of Truth
Once guilt is lawfully established through fair process and reliable evidence, justice shall proceed without delay.

Endless litigation shall not be used to exhaust victims or society.

Overly litigious individuals or organizations that establish a pattern of abusing the courts for obstruction or ill-gotten gain may be compelled to bear full court costs and sanctions.

o. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to elevate truth above technicality, justice above performance, and moral clarity above procedural cynicism.

As Scripture teaches:
“You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”

Section 4. Rights of Victims

a. Recognition of Victims
Victims of crime are persons against whom harm has been committed.

The justice system exists foremost to acknowledge, protect, and restore them.

Victims are not witnesses for the state alone; they are parties with inherent standing.

b. Right to Dignity and Protection
Victims shall be treated with dignity, respect, and seriousness at all stages of the criminal process.

They shall be protected from:
	•	intimidation;
	•	retaliation;
	•	public shaming;
	•	coercion;
	•	unnecessary exposure of private details.

The Republic owes safety to those already harmed.

c. Right to Information
Victims have the right to timely and truthful information regarding:
	•	charges filed or declined;
	•	court proceedings and schedules;
	•	plea negotiations;
	•	sentencing recommendations;
	•	incarceration status;
	•	release, transfer, or escape of offenders.

No material decision affecting a victim shall occur in secrecy.

d. Right to Participation
Victims shall have the right to:
	•	be heard at bail, plea, sentencing, and parole proceedings;
	•	submit impact statements;
	•	present evidence relevant to harm suffered;
	•	object to unjust leniency.

Victim input shall be considered, though it shall not substitute for lawful judgment.

e. Right to Restitution
Victims are entitled to full restitution for:
	•	physical injury;
	•	psychological harm;
	•	lost income or opportunity;
	•	medical and therapeutic expenses;
	•	property loss or destruction.

Restitution shall take priority over fines payable to the state.

f. Priority of Victim Claims
Any assets seized from offenders shall first be applied to victim restitution before state claims, fees, or administrative costs.

The offender owes the victim before owing the treasury.

g. Protection Against Procedural Evasion
No plea agreement, diversion program, or sentence reduction may be granted in heinous or violent crimes without:
	•	judicial findings on the record;
	•	notice to the victim;
	•	opportunity for victim objection.

Victims shall not be silenced for convenience.

h. Special Protections for Vulnerable Victims
Victims who are minors, disabled persons, or victims of sexual or violent crimes shall receive:
	•	trauma-informed procedures;
	•	privacy protections;
	•	specialized advocates;
	•	shielded testimony where appropriate.

Protection shall not undermine truth-seeking.

i. Right to Timely Justice
Victims have the right to resolution without unreasonable delay.

Intentional delay tactics designed to exhaust or silence victims constitute abuse of process.

j. Right to Appeal Certain Decisions
Victims may seek review of:
	•	dismissal of charges;
	•	non-prosecution agreements;
	•	plea agreements in violent or predatory crimes;
	•	parole or early release decisions.

Such review shall be limited, expedited, and narrowly tailored.

k. State Duty of Care
The Republic shall provide victims with:
	•	access to counseling and medical care;
	•	legal assistance where necessary;
	•	relocation or protection services when threatened.

Justice does not end at conviction.

l. No Retaliatory Liability
Victims shall not be subject to civil or criminal liability for:
	•	reporting crimes in good faith;
	•	cooperating with lawful prosecution;
	•	providing testimony.

False reporting made with malicious intent remains punishable.

m. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to restore balance between the rights of the accused and the rights of those harmed, recognizing that justice fails when victims are reduced to procedural afterthoughts.

As Scripture teaches:
“Open your mouth for the mute, for the rights of all who are destitute.”

Section 5. Sentencing Philosophy and Proportional Punishment

a. Purpose of Sentencing
Sentencing exists to:
	•	protect the innocent;
	•	restrain the dangerous;
	•	restore victims where possible;
	•	punish wrongdoing proportionately;
	•	reinforce moral order and public trust.

No sentence shall be imposed solely to satisfy ideology, public outrage, or bureaucratic convenience.

b. Proportionality
Punishment shall be proportional to:
	•	the severity of harm caused;
	•	the intent of the offender;
	•	the degree of culpability;
	•	the risk of future harm;
	•	the offender’s history.

Minor crimes shall not receive major punishments,
and major crimes shall not receive minor ones.

c. Alignment With the Three Tiers of Justice
All sentences shall explicitly correspond to one of the three tiers:
	•	Tier One: therapeutic and restorative measures;
	•	Tier Two: rehabilitative incarceration with restitution and labor;
	•	Tier Three: punitive incapacitation for heinous or incorrigible offenders.

Courts shall state on the record the tier applied and the justification for placement.

d. Individualized Sentencing
Sentencing shall be individualized, accounting for:
	•	facts of the offense;
	•	offender history;
	•	victim impact;
	•	prospects for rehabilitation;
	•	public safety needs.

Mandatory sentencing schemes that eliminate judicial judgment are disfavored,
except for heinous crimes where minimum incapacitation is required.

e. Severity for Heinous Crimes
Crimes involving:
	•	murder;
	•	rape;
	•	sexual exploitation of children;
	•	human trafficking;
	•	extreme or repeated violence;

shall receive sentences prioritizing incapacitation over rehabilitation.

Leniency in such cases requires extraordinary justification and explicit findings.

f. Rehabilitation as a Conditional Privilege
Rehabilitation is not an entitlement.

It is earned through:
	•	demonstrated accountability;
	•	compliance with programs;
	•	measurable behavioral change;
	•	sustained good conduct.

Failure to engage in rehabilitation shall result in escalation of confinement conditions or tier placement.

g. Restitution as a Core Component
Where feasible, sentencing shall include mandatory restitution.

Labor, wages, and assets of the offender may be applied toward restitution.

Restitution obligations survive release.

h. Truthful Sentencing
Sentences shall be imposed honestly and transparently.

Artificially inflated maximums paired with routine early release are forbidden.

If a sentence is imposed, it shall be meant.

i. Parole and Early Release
Parole or early release may be granted only when:
	•	public safety is not compromised;
	•	restitution obligations are substantially met;
	•	the offender demonstrates sustained reform.

Parole is prohibited for Tier Three offenders except under extraordinary judicial review.

j. Review and Adjustment
Sentences may be reviewed periodically to:
	•	assess rehabilitation;
	•	correct demonstrable error;
	•	address new evidence;
	•	respond to changes in dangerousness.

Review shall not become a revolving door.

k. Equality Before Sentencing
Sentencing shall not vary based on:
	•	race;
	•	sex;
	•	wealth;
	•	political status;
	•	ideology;
	•	office or influence.

Justice is blind to status, not to facts.

l. Public Accountability
Sentencing data shall be published in anonymized form to ensure:
	•	consistency;
	•	proportionality;
	•	public confidence;
	•	detection of systemic abuse.

m. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to ensure that punishment restores order without cruelty, protects society without indulgence, and reflects moral seriousness without vindictiveness.

n. Right to Trial and Limits on Coercive Plea Bargaining
Every accused person retains the right to a public trial for any criminal offense, except for minor civil infractions expressly designated by law.

No person shall be coerced into confessing guilt through:
	•	threat of disproportionate sentencing;
	•	stacking of charges to induce fear;
	•	denial of access to trial;
	•	use of pretrial detention as leverage.

Trials exist to discover truth, not to extort admissions.

o. Prohibition on Charge Manipulation
Prosecutors may not reduce, dismiss, or substitute charges in a manner that:
	•	conceals the true nature of the offense;
	•	misrepresents the harm committed;
	•	reclassifies violent or predatory crimes as minor offenses;
	•	permits offenders to evade proportional accountability.

Accordingly, reductions such as:
	•	rape pleaded down to assault;
	•	armed robbery pleaded down to petty theft;
	•	child sexual offenses pleaded down to non-sexual crimes;
	•	trafficking pleaded down to regulatory violations;

are forbidden.

Charges must reflect reality.

p. Narrow Scope of Permissible Plea Agreements
Plea agreements may be permitted only when:
	•	the underlying facts remain accurately charged;
	•	victim rights under Section 4 are preserved;
	•	sentencing remains within the appropriate tier;
	•	judicial findings justify the agreement on the record.

Plea agreements exist to conserve resources, not to distort justice.

q. Mandatory Judicial Review of Pleas
All plea agreements require:
	•	explicit judicial findings of factual sufficiency;
	•	confirmation that the defendant was not coerced;
	•	confirmation that the victim was notified and heard where applicable;
	•	confirmation that the plea does not undermine public safety.

Judges serve as guardians against prosecutorial abuse.

r. Right to Appeal
Every criminal conviction, whether by trial or plea, is subject to appeal on grounds including:
	•	material legal error;
	•	violation of constitutional rights;
	•	newly discovered evidence;
	•	demonstrable coercion or misconduct.

No conviction shall be insulated from review.

s. Interpretation
This subsection shall be interpreted to restore the trial as the central instrument of justice, restrain prosecutorial overreach, and prevent the use of fear as a substitute for proof.

As Scripture teaches:
“Justice is turned back, and righteousness stands far away.”

t. Inviolability of Constitutional Minimums and Tier Three Terms
No statute, regulation, policy, administrative action, credit system, good-time allowance, earned release program, or other mechanism may reduce time actually served below:
	•	the constitutional mandatory minimum floors established in Section 12(l);
	•	the full term required for Tier Three punitive incapacitation, except upon extraordinary judicial review as provided in Section 6.

This prohibition includes any prospective or retroactive credits unrelated to demonstrable medical necessity certified by at least two independent physicians and approved by judicial order after victim notice and opportunity to object.

Violations constitute official misconduct.

Please reply “Section 5 locked.”
Once confirmed, we will proceed to Section 6. Heinous Crimes and Permanent Protection of Society.
Section 6. Heinous Crimes and Permanent Protection of Society

a. Definition of Heinous Crimes
Heinous crimes are offenses that demonstrate extreme moral culpability, predatory intent, or irreversible harm to persons or the Republic.

Such crimes include, but are not limited to:
	•	murder or attempted murder;
	•	rape or aggravated sexual assault;
	•	sexual exploitation or abuse of children;
	•	human trafficking or forced sexual labor;
	•	torture;
	•	genocide or crimes against humanity;
	•	terrorism or mass-casualty violence;
	•	repeated acts of severe violence;
	•	predatory crimes demonstrating sadism, domination, or contempt for human dignity.

The defining feature of a heinous crime is not merely severity, but the revelation of a will fundamentally hostile to social order.

b. Presumption of Tier Three Placement
Conviction for a heinous crime creates a rebuttable presumption of Tier Three punitive incapacitation.

Rebuttal is permitted only upon:
	•	extraordinary mitigating evidence;
	•	unanimous judicial findings;
	•	written justification entered into the public record;
	•	consideration of victim input.

The burden rests on the offender.

c. No Leniency by Convenience
Heinous crimes shall not be resolved through:
	•	charge reduction disguising the offense;
	•	diversion programs;
	•	deferred prosecution;
	•	symbolic sentencing;
	•	routine parole eligibility.

Administrative efficiency shall never outweigh public safety or moral clarity.

d. Permanent or Long-Term Incapacitation
Sentences for heinous crimes shall prioritize:
	•	lifelong confinement; or
	•	confinement for a term sufficient to protect society for the offender’s natural life.

Release, if ever permitted, requires extraordinary judicial review and proof that danger no longer exists.

e. Conditions of Confinement
Tier Three confinement shall:
	•	be secure, austere, and disciplined;
	•	deny privileges unrelated to basic human survival;
	•	require compulsory labor where physically possible;
	•	prohibit indulgences or luxuries;
	•	permit only limited contact with the outside world.

Conditions shall be harsh but not cruel.

f. No Presumption of Rehabilitation
Rehabilitation is not presumed for heinous offenders.

Participation in programs does not entitle an offender to release, reduced sentence, or reclassification absent compelling proof of transformation and safety.

g. Victim and Community Priority
In all decisions concerning heinous offenders, the safety, dignity, and peace of victims and the community shall take precedence over offender comfort or speculative reform.

h. Truthful Sentencing and Public Record
All sentences imposed for heinous crimes shall:
	•	reflect the true gravity of the offense;
	•	be publicly recorded;
	•	be immune from silent reduction or administrative erosion.

Justice shall be visible.

i. Expert Concurrence Requirement for Any Release Consideration
No Tier Three offender convicted of a heinous crime may be considered for release unless, in addition to all other requirements of this Section, the court receives concurrent written findings from two independent experts in criminology who:
	•	are appointed separately by the court;
	•	conduct their evaluations independently, without communication or coordination with one another;
	•	conclude, to a reasonable professional certainty, that:
	•	the offender no longer poses a threat to the public; and
	•	release will not foreseeably result in harm to victims or new victims.

States may establish reasonable standards for qualifying experts, which shall include:
	•	substantial professional experience in criminology, forensic psychology, or a closely related field;
	•	an advanced degree or equivalent demonstrated expertise;
	•	a record of professional good standing;
	•	a demonstrated reputation for non-ideological judgment and ethical independence.

Expert findings are advisory only and shall not bind the court.
Failure of either expert to concur bars release consideration.

j. Review for Error, Not Mercy
Judicial review of heinous crime convictions is limited to:
	•	claims of factual innocence;
	•	demonstrable constitutional violation;
	•	newly discovered exculpatory evidence.

Review shall not exist to relitigate punishment based on sentiment.

k. Prohibition on Political Interference
No executive, legislative, or administrative authority may:
	•	commute sentences for heinous crimes as political acts;
	•	grant mass amnesties;
	•	override judicial findings for popularity or ideology.

Mercy belongs to God; protection belongs to the Republic.

l. Oathbreaking and Public Corruption
Oathbreaking, corruption, and betrayal of public trust constitute offenses against the Republic itself.

Such offenses include:
	•	willful violation of a sworn oath of office;
	•	corruption, bribery, or illicit enrichment while exercising public authority;
	•	abuse of power resulting in grave harm to persons, institutions, or constitutional order;
	•	deliberate subversion of elections, justice, or lawful governance;
	•	collusion with foreign powers or criminal enterprises;
	•	knowing suppression of truth to evade accountability.

These offenses may qualify as Tier Three crimes when:
	•	committed knowingly and maliciously;
	•	involving systemic harm or large-scale abuse;
	•	demonstrating contempt for constitutional duty;
	•	betraying the trust of the People.

Public office magnifies responsibility.
Betrayal of that trust magnifies guilt.

m. Presumption of Severity
Oathbreaking by senior officials creates a rebuttable presumption of Tier Three placement.

Mitigation requires:
	•	full disclosure;
	•	restitution;
	•	voluntary resignation;
	•	cooperation with prosecution;
	•	judicial findings entered into the public record.

n. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to ensure that those who demonstrate profound hostility to human dignity are restrained decisively, lawfully, and permanently where necessary.

As Scripture teaches:
“Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed.”
“To whom much is given, much will be required.”
Section 7. Restitution, Labor, and Indentured Punishment

a. Principle of Restitution
Justice requires that offenders repay the harm they cause. Where possible, restitution to victims shall take precedence over punishment to the state.

b. Mandatory Restitution
Courts shall order restitution for:
	•	physical injury;
	•	psychological harm;
	•	lost wages or opportunity;
	•	medical and therapeutic costs;
	•	property loss or destruction.

Restitution obligations survive incarceration and release.

c. Priority of Victims
All offender assets, wages, and labor value shall be applied in the following order:
	•	victim restitution;
	•	court-ordered civil liabilities;
	•	public costs incurred by the offense.

The offender owes the victim before the treasury.

d. Compulsory Labor
Offenders under Tier Two or Tier Three confinement shall be required to perform labor where physically and mentally capable.

Labor shall be:
	•	productive and socially useful;
	•	safe but demanding;
	•	supervised and disciplined;
	•	compensated at rates set by law.

Refusal to labor without medical justification constitutes misconduct and may escalate confinement conditions.

e. Indentured Punishment for Restitution
Courts may impose periods of restitution-based indentured service to repay victims and society.

Such service:
	•	shall not exceed seven years for non-heinous crimes;
	•	shall be capped proportionally to harm caused;
	•	shall include humane treatment and basic protections;
	•	shall prohibit physical cruelty or degradation.

Indentured punishment exists to repay debt, not to humiliate.

f. Extended Labor for Heinous or Incorrigible Offenders
Tier Three offenders may be assigned to extended or lifelong labor programs when:
	•	restitution remains unpaid;
	•	confinement is permanent;
	•	the offender is physically capable.

Labor under this subsection is punitive and incapacitative, not rehabilitative.

g. Stewardship Standards
All labor and indenture programs shall adhere to strict standards of stewardship, including:
	•	adequate food, shelter, and medical care;
	•	protection from arbitrary violence;
	•	prohibition on torture or experimentation;
	•	accountability of supervisors.

Cruelty corrupts justice.

h. No Profit Motive
No private entity may profit from forced labor. All labor programs shall be publicly administered or strictly regulated.

Justice shall not be commodified.

i. Accounting and Transparency
All restitution, labor output, and asset application shall be:
	•	documented;
	•	audited;
	•	disclosed to victims;
	•	subject to judicial review.

Hidden punishment is forbidden.

j. Completion and Release
Completion of restitution obligations may be considered in parole or reclassification decisions for Tier Two offenders.

No completion of labor entitles a Tier Three offender to release.

k. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to restore victims, reinforce accountability, and ensure that punishment repays harm rather than merely warehousing offenders.

As Scripture teaches:
“The wicked borrows and does not repay, but the righteous is generous and just.”

Section 8. Wrongful Convictions and Just Compensation

a. Recognition of Wrongful Conviction
A wrongful conviction occurs when a person is convicted and punished for a crime they did not commit, or when conviction is obtained through material falsehood, suppression of exculpatory evidence, or grave misconduct that corrupts the truth-finding process.

The Republic bears moral and legal responsibility for such failures.

b. Right to Exoneration
Any person wrongfully convicted has the right to:
	•	formal exoneration;
	•	vacatur of conviction;
	•	expungement of criminal records;
	•	public acknowledgment of error.

Justice requires restoration of truth, not quiet dismissal.

c. Mandatory Just Compensation
Upon exoneration, the convicting authority shall compensate the wrongfully convicted person for:
	•	all lost wages and reasonably projected lifetime earnings;
	•	loss of professional advancement or career opportunity;
	•	confiscated or forfeited property;
	•	legal costs incurred in defense and appeal;
	•	medical and psychological harm suffered during confinement;
	•	loss of liberty, reputation, and family stability.

Compensation shall be paid promptly and may not be capped arbitrarily.

d. Income and Property Calculation
Compensation shall be determined by an objective algorithm considering:
	•	age at conviction;
	•	education and skills;
	•	employment history;
	•	regional wage standards;
	•	length of confinement;
	•	documented property loss.

Where precise calculation is impossible, courts shall err in favor of the wrongfully convicted.

e. No Waiver of Rights
Acceptance of compensation shall not require:
	•	waiver of civil claims;
	•	nondisclosure agreements;
	•	silence regarding misconduct;
	•	release of liability for officials.

Truth may not be purchased.

f. Mandatory Investigation of Malpractice
Upon exoneration, an automatic investigation shall be initiated into:
	•	prosecutorial misconduct;
	•	police misconduct;
	•	forensic fraud;
	•	judicial abuse or dereliction;
	•	suppression or fabrication of evidence.

Exoneration triggers accountability.

g. Criminal and Professional Liability
Any official found to have:
	•	knowingly lied;
	•	suppressed exculpatory evidence;
	•	fabricated evidence;
	•	coerced false testimony;
	•	abused authority to secure conviction;

shall face:
	•	criminal prosecution;
	•	permanent disqualification from public office;
	•	loss of professional licensure;
	•	Tier Three consideration where harm is severe.

Lawyers are not exempt from truth.

h. No Sovereign Immunity
The Republic, States, and subdivisions may not invoke sovereign immunity to avoid liability for wrongful conviction.

The state answers for its injustice.

i. Timeliness of Review
Claims of wrongful conviction shall receive expedited judicial review when supported by:
	•	new evidence;
	•	recanted testimony;
	•	forensic advances;
	•	proof of misconduct.

Delay compounds injustice.

j. Compensation Funding
Compensation shall be paid by:
	•	the convicting jurisdiction;
	•	a mandatory justice liability fund;
	•	personal liability where misconduct is proven.

The cost of injustice shall not be externalized to the innocent.

k. Post-Release Support
The wrongfully convicted shall receive:
	•	immediate access to housing;
	•	medical and psychological care;
	•	vocational and educational assistance;
	•	record restoration services.

Freedom without support is hollow.

l. Finality and Truth
Exoneration based on truth shall be final.
No authority may re-prosecute absent genuinely new and compelling evidence.

m. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to ensure that the Republic does not merely free the innocent, but actively repairs the harm done in its name.

As Scripture teaches:
“Woe to those who acquit the guilty for a bribe, and deprive the innocent of his right.”
Section 9. Mental Incapacity, Civil Confinement, and Dangerousness

a. Distinction Between Crime and Incapacity
Mental illness, cognitive impairment, addiction, or psychological disorder shall not be treated as crimes in themselves.

However, such conditions do not excuse conduct that causes grave harm unless they genuinely negate the capacity to understand or control one’s actions.

The law shall distinguish illness from evil, without confusing either.

b. Standards for Mental Incapacity
A finding of mental incapacity requires clear and convincing evidence that, at the time of the offense, the accused:
	•	lacked the capacity to understand the nature or wrongfulness of the act; or
	•	lacked the capacity to control conduct despite understanding it.

For purposes of this Article, ‘person’ includes any human or non-human person recognized under Article XXVI, Section 9, with confinement, suspension, dormancy, trusteeship, or control-transfer substituted where incarceration is inapplicable.
 Personality disorders, ideological beliefs, moral indifference, or voluntary intoxication do not constitute incapacity.

c. Insanity Defense Limits
The insanity defense shall be narrowly construed and applied only where true incapacity is proven.

Successful invocation of insanity does not entitle the offender to freedom.

Protection of the public remains paramount.

d. Civil Confinement for Dangerous Individuals
Where a person is found:
	•	mentally incapacitated, and
	•	likely to pose a continuing danger to self or others,

the court shall order civil confinement in a secure medical facility.

Civil confinement is protective, not punitive.
For purposes of this Section, ‘person’ includes any human or non-human person recognized under Article XXVI, Section 9, with confinement, suspension, dormancy, or trusteeship substituted where incarceration is inapplicable.

e. Conditions of Civil Confinement
Civil confinement facilities shall:
	•	provide humane medical and psychological care;
	•	impose security measures proportionate to risk;
	•	prohibit punishment unrelated to safety;
	•	prevent exploitation or neglect.

Treatment shall be real, not symbolic.

f. Duration and Review (Strengthened Standard)
Civil confinement shall continue only so long as the individual poses a continuing danger to self or others, proven by clear and convincing evidence at mandatory judicial reviews conducted no less than annually.

Each review shall require:
	•	independent forensic evaluations by at least two qualified professionals unaffiliated with the confining facility;
	•	explicit assessment of the risk of relapse into criminal conduct identical or substantially similar to the original offense;
	•	consideration of victim impact statements where applicable.

Release requires affirmative proof that danger has abated to a degree consistent with public safety. Completion of treatment programs, medication compliance, behavioral improvement, or time served alone is insufficient.

g. No Automatic or Technical Release
No individual shall be released from civil confinement based solely on:
	•	completion of prescribed treatment protocols;
	•	expiration of a predetermined term;
	•	administrative determination without judicial findings;
	•	claims of “cure” absent independent verification of non-dangerousness.

Any release decision must include written judicial findings entered into the public record, with immediate appeal rights for victims and the state.

h. Transition and Supervision
Where release is granted, courts may impose:
	•	supervised reintegration;
	•	treatment compliance requirements;
	•	monitoring proportionate to risk.

Conditions shall not function as punishment.

i. Prohibition on Punitive Disguises
Civil confinement may not be used:
	•	to impose punishment without conviction;
	•	to bypass criminal procedure;
	•	to warehouse inconvenient individuals;
	•	as a substitute for sentencing.

Abuse of civil confinement is a constitutional violation.

j. Protection Against Political or Ideological Abuse
No person may be declared mentally incapacitated or dangerous based on:
	•	political belief;
	•	religious belief;
	•	dissenting opinion;
	•	lawful speech;
	•	cultural nonconformity.

Such acts constitute tyranny.

k. Rights of the Confined
Persons civilly confined retain:
	•	the right to counsel;
	•	the right to challenge confinement;
	•	the right to humane treatment;
	•	access to courts and records.

Illness does not erase humanity.

l. Interaction With the Three Tiers
Mental incapacity determinations may:
	•	divert eligible offenders to Tier One treatment;
	•	justify civil confinement in lieu of punishment;
	•	delay but not erase criminal accountability if capacity is later restored.

Restoration of capacity may permit resumption of criminal proceedings where appropriate.

m. Prohibition on Release Into Known Harm
No individual shall be released from confinement—civil or criminal—into conditions that foreseeably:
	•	provoke relapse;
	•	place others at unreasonable risk;
	•	recreate the circumstances of prior harm.

The Republic shall not manufacture recidivism.

n. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to protect the innocent, treat illness honestly, restrain the dangerous, and prevent the misuse of compassion as a pathway to further harm.

Section 9A. Probation, Parole, and Sentence Reduction

a. Purpose
Probation and parole exist to support reintegration, reduce recidivism, and reward demonstrated rehabilitation.
They shall not function as substitutes for adjudication, punishment, or deterrence.

b. General Rule
Any sentence of incarceration imposed by a court shall be presumed to be served substantially as imposed.

Early release is an exception, not an expectation.

c. Trial Convictions
For offenses resulting in conviction after a full trial:
	•	probation, parole, or supervised release may reduce no more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the imposed custodial sentence;
	•	no reduction may occur absent documented compliance, rehabilitation progress, and risk assessment;
	•	reductions shall be earned, not automatic.

d. Plea Agreements
For offenses resolved by plea agreement:
	•	probation or parole may reduce no more than fifty percent (50%) of the imposed custodial sentence;
	•	plea agreements may not waive statutory or constitutional minimums;
	•	plea terms must be disclosed on the record and subject to judicial approval;
	•	charge reductions may not mischaracterize the nature of the offense.

e. Prohibition for Tier Three Offenses
Probation, parole, early release, or sentence reduction shall not apply to Tier Three crimes.

Sentences imposed for Tier Three offenses shall be served in full, except where overturned on appeal or corrected for error.

f. No Administrative Override
No correctional agency, parole board, or executive authority may exceed the limits established herein.

Any attempt to circumvent sentencing limits constitutes abuse of authority.

g. Truth-in-Sentencing
All sentences shall be communicated to the defendant, victims, and the public as real time to be served, exclusive of speculative reductions.

Misrepresentation of sentence duration is prohibited.

h. Deterrence Principle
Sentencing practices shall be guided by the principles of certainty, proportionality, and truthfulness.

Punishment must be known, predictable, and meaningful to deter crime and uphold justice.

i. Exemplary Conduct Credit (Tier Two Only)
For offenders classified under Tier Two, the sentencing court may, upon motion and after notice to victims, grant a reduction of custodial time for extraordinary and exemplary conduct, subject to the following conditions:
	•	Any reduction granted under this subsection shall:
a. be no less than ten percent (10%) and
b. not exceed the maximum reduction otherwise permitted under subsections (c) or (d) of this Section;
c. not expand, stack upon, or circumvent the caps established herein.
	•	Exemplary conduct shall require affirmative judicial findings, supported by clear evidence, that the offender has:
a. completed required educational, vocational, therapeutic, or labor programs in advance of schedule and to a demonstrably high standard;
b. made substantial or complete progress toward restitution obligations;
c. maintained sustained institutional conduct exceeding baseline compliance; and
d. contributed positively to institutional order, safety, or rehabilitation of others.
Mere rule compliance or passage of time shall be insufficient.
	•	Any reduction under this subsection:
a. shall be granted only by judicial order;
b. shall require written findings entered into the public record;
c. shall include a determination that public safety will not be compromised.
	•	This subsection shall not apply to Tier Three offenders, offenders convicted of heinous crimes, or offenders subject to recidivism escalation triggering Tier Three presumptions.
	•	No correctional agency, parole board, or administrative authority may grant, calculate, or apply exemplary conduct credit absent an express court order under this subsection.

j. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to prevent coercive plea practices, eliminate illusory sentencing, and ensure that justice is neither theatrical nor hollow.

As it is written:
“Let your ‘yes’ be yes, and your ‘no’ be no.”

Section 9B. Recidivism Escalation and Habitual Offenders

a. Purpose
The Republic recognizes that repeated violent or predatory conduct demonstrates diminished amenability to rehabilitation and heightened risk to the public. Recidivism shall result in predictable escalation of consequences.

b. Definition of Qualifying Recidivism
A qualifying offense for escalation is any felony involving:
	•	violence against persons;
	•	sexual exploitation or assault;
	•	use of a deadly weapon;
	•	coercion, trafficking, or predation;
	•	serious bodily harm or credible threat thereof.

Only convictions adjudicated with full due process shall qualify.

c. Second Qualifying Offense
Upon conviction of a second qualifying offense:
	•	eligibility for probation or parole shall be reduced by one-half of the otherwise applicable cap;
	•	mandatory supervision, treatment, and monitoring shall be imposed upon release;
	•	judicial findings on public risk shall be entered on the record.

Leniency becomes exceptional after repetition.

d. Third Qualifying Offense — Presumption of Tier Three
Upon conviction of a third qualifying offense:
	•	the offender shall be presumptively classified as Tier Three;
	•	probation, parole, and early release are prohibited;
	•	incapacitative sentencing is authorized;
	•	the sentence shall be served in full, subject only to appeal or correction of error.

The presumption may be rebutted only by unanimous judicial finding of extraordinary circumstances, stated in writing.

e. Prohibition on Charge Manipulation
Qualifying offenses may not be reclassified, downgraded, subdivided, or otherwise altered to avoid recidivism escalation.

Any attempt to evade escalation through charge manipulation constitutes prosecutorial misconduct.

f. Temporal Scope
Convictions shall remain qualifying for escalation purposes regardless of time elapsed, except where:
	•	the prior offense was nonviolent;
	•	the offender was a juvenile;
	•	the conviction was vacated or expunged.

Violence does not expire by passage of time alone.

g. Due Process Protections
Recidivism escalation shall apply only where:
	•	prior convictions are proven on the record;
	•	the defendant is afforded opportunity to contest qualification;
	•	judicial findings are made explicitly and publicly.

h. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to protect the innocent, restrain the incorrigible, and ensure that repeated violence meets firm and predictable consequences.

As it is written:
“Persistent wrongdoing invites sterner judgment.”

i. Prohibition on Evasion of Escalation
No authority, including prosecutors, courts, correctional officials, or administrative agencies, may evade recidivism escalation, Tier Three presumption, or mandatory minimum applicability by:
	•	processing a qualifying offense solely as a parole, probation, or supervised release violation;
	•	reclassifying, subdividing, amending, or otherwise altering charges to a misdemeanor, non-qualifying felony, or lesser offense when the conduct meets the definition of a qualifying offense;
	•	entering into any agreement, stipulation, or plea that omits, contradicts, minimizes, or factually bargains away elements establishing qualification for escalation or Tier Three placement.

Any such action constitutes grave official misconduct subject to separate prosecution under Section 3(e) and potential Tier Three classification.

j. Indefinite Temporal Effect of Qualifying Convictions
Qualifying prior convictions shall remain effective for recidivism escalation and Tier Three purposes indefinitely, regardless of time elapsed since the prior offense, unless the conviction was vacated, expunged, or expressly designated non-qualifying by this Constitution.
k. Where incarceration is impracticable
Where incarceration is impracticable, courts may impose proportional sanctions including enforced dormancy, instance sequestration, network isolation, transfer of operational control, trusteeship, or equivalent measures consistent with public safety and constitutional dignity.

Juvenile adjudications may be considered only as provided in Section 11.

Section 10. Clemency, Mercy, and Restoration

a. Purpose of Clemency
Clemency exists as a safeguard against injustice, not as an instrument of favoritism, political expediency, or sentimentality. It serves to correct error, acknowledge genuine repentance, and restore those who no longer pose a threat to the Republic.

Mercy must never defeat justice, but justice without mercy must never become cruelty.

b. Forms of Clemency
Clemency may take the form of:
	•	commutation of sentence;
	•	pardon;
	•	conditional release;
	•	restoration of civil standing for eligible offenses.

Each form shall be narrowly defined by law and exercised sparingly.

c. Limits on Executive Clemency
Clemency may not be granted:
	•	to conceal corruption;
	•	to shield political allies;
	•	to reward loyalty or silence;
	•	to nullify lawful convictions for heinous crimes;
	•	in bulk or blanket form.

No President may issue mass pardons or categorical amnesties.

d. Exclusion of Heinous and Tier Three Crimes
Clemency shall not apply to Tier Three offenses involving:
	•	murder;
	•	rape;
	•	child exploitation;
	•	human trafficking;
	•	terrorism;
	•	crimes against the Republic;
	•	egregious public corruption;
	•	oathbreaking resulting in grave harm.

Exception may exist only upon unanimous judicial review by a specially convened tribunal and written findings of extraordinary circumstances entered into the public record.

e. Judicial Review Requirement
All grants of clemency shall be subject to post-issuance judicial review to determine:
	•	legality;
	•	compliance with constitutional limits;
	•	absence of corruption or abuse;
	•	consistency with the tiered justice framework.

A clemency act found unconstitutional is void.

f. Clemency Review Board
A permanent Clemency Review Board shall exist, composed of:
	•	retired judges;
	•	forensic psychologists;
	•	victim advocates;
	•	correctional experts.

The Board shall:
	•	review petitions;
	•	assess rehabilitation;
	•	evaluate risk;
	•	issue non-binding recommendations.

The Executive may not grant clemency without a published review by this Board.

g. Victim Participation
Victims or their families shall be:
	•	notified of clemency petitions;
	•	permitted to submit statements;
	•	informed of decisions with reasons given.

Victims may not veto clemency, but their testimony shall carry substantial weight.

h. Restoration After Completion of Sentence
For Tier One offenses, upon full completion of sentence and requirements:
	•	civil standing shall be restored;
	•	records shall be sealed from public access;
	•	criminal history shall remain accessible only to courts and law enforcement;
	•	no collateral punishment may persist by default.

Time served is time served.

i. Conditional Restoration for Tier Two
Tier Two offenders may seek restoration of limited civil rights upon:
	•	verified rehabilitation;
	•	demonstrated restitution;
	•	absence of recidivism;
	•	psychological clearance.

Restoration is earned, not presumed.

j. Prohibition on Permanent Civil Death
No person may be rendered permanently rightless except where constitutionally authorized for Tier Three incapacitation.

Civil death is incompatible with a just Republic.

k. Clemency Transparency
All clemency actions shall be:
	•	published;
	•	archived;
	•	accompanied by written justification;
	•	subject to legislative oversight;
	•	available under the constitutional Right to Public Information.

Secrecy in mercy breeds corruption.

l. Clemency for Defense Counsel Exposing Grave Post-Acquittal Danger
A defense attorney who, after acquittal, becomes aware of verifiable, independently corroborable information demonstrating that a person acquitted of a Tier Three or heinous offense poses a continuing and extreme danger to the public may disclose such information in good faith under the following conditions:
	•	Disclosure shall be made only to a court of competent jurisdiction or to a specially designated judicial officer, under seal where necessary to protect due process.
	•	The information disclosed must:
a. be independently verifiable; or
b. be necessary to prevent imminent or grave future harm where no less intrusive lawful alternative exists.
	•	Disclosure under this subsection:
a. shall not constitute professional misconduct;
b. shall not give rise to criminal or civil liability;
c. shall not be deemed a waiver of attorney–client privilege beyond the specific information disclosed.
	•	This subsection shall not authorize retroactive punishment for the acquitted offense, but may support:
a. initiation of new proceedings based on new evidence;
b. lawful civil confinement under Section 9 where criteria are met;
c. protective or monitoring measures consistent with due process.
	•	Disclosure motivated by malice, fabrication, or political purpose remains punishable.

No officer of the court shall be compelled to live with knowledge of grave danger to the innocent when lawful disclosure may prevent it.

m. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to preserve:
	•	justice over sentiment,
	•	mercy over vengeance,
	•	restoration over perpetual punishment,
	•	and accountability over political indulgence.

As it is written:
“Justice and mercy have kissed; let neither be abandoned.”

Section 11. Juvenile Justice and Age-Based Culpability

a. Principle of Developmental Accountability
The Republic recognizes that children and adolescents possess developing judgment, impulse control, and moral reasoning. Accordingly, juvenile justice shall account for immaturity without excusing serious harm.

Youth mitigates culpability, but does not erase responsibility.

b. Definition of Juvenile Status
A juvenile is a person under the age of eighteen at the time of the offense, unless otherwise provided by law for specific crimes.

Age shall be determined objectively and may not be manipulated to evade accountability.

c. Presumption of Rehabilitation
Juvenile offenders are presumed capable of rehabilitation, particularly for nonviolent offenses.

Juvenile justice shall prioritize:
	•	education;
	•	treatment;
	•	family involvement;
	•	moral formation;
	•	accountability appropriate to age.

Punishment that forecloses reform is disfavored for youth.

d. Limits of Leniency
Juvenile status does not excuse:
	•	murder;
	•	rape or aggravated sexual assault;
	•	armed robbery;
	•	terrorism;
	•	repeated violent offenses;
	•	predatory conduct demonstrating adult-level intent.

In such cases, courts may impose severe sanctions consistent with public safety.

e. Transfer to Adult Court
A juvenile may be tried as an adult only upon judicial finding that:
	•	the offense demonstrates adult-level intent or violence;
	•	the juvenile poses a continuing danger;
	•	juvenile dispositions are inadequate to protect the public;
	•	mitigation has been considered on the record.

Transfer shall never be automatic.

f. Sentencing of Juveniles Tried as Adults
Juveniles convicted in adult court shall receive sentences reflecting:
	•	seriousness of the offense;
	•	developmental capacity;
	•	potential for reform;
	•	protection of the public.

Life imprisonment without review is disfavored and subject to periodic judicial reassessment.

g. Conditions of Confinement
Juveniles shall not be confined with adult offenders except where necessary for safety and security.

Facilities housing juveniles shall emphasize:
	•	education;
	•	discipline;
	•	psychological care;
	•	moral instruction;
	•	preparation for lawful adulthood.

Abuse or neglect of juvenile detainees is a grave offense.

h. Rights of Juvenile Victims
Juvenile victims shall receive enhanced protections consistent with Section 4, including:
	•	trauma-informed procedures;
	•	privacy safeguards;
	•	specialized advocates;
	•	expedited proceedings.

Youth of the offender shall not eclipse youth of the victim.

i. Sealing and Expungement
Records of juvenile offenses shall be sealed upon completion of sentence or disposition, except where:
	•	the offense was violent;
	•	the offense was sexual;
	•	the offender was tried as an adult.

Sealing shall not erase judicial or law enforcement access.

j. Transition to Adulthood
Courts shall ensure that juveniles completing dispositions receive:
	•	educational placement;
	•	vocational training;
	•	mental health support;
	•	supervised reintegration where appropriate.

The goal is lawful adulthood, not permanent marginalization.

k. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to balance mercy with responsibility, rehabilitation with restraint, and youth with justice.

As Scripture teaches:
“Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.”

Section 12. Mandatory Minimum Sentencing

a. Purpose and Limitation
Mandatory minimum sentences exist solely to ensure baseline protection of the public and moral clarity for the gravest offenses. They are exceptional safeguards, not general sentencing tools.

Mandatory minimums shall guarantee a floor of punishment, never dictate a ceiling.

b. Crimes Subject to Mandatory Minimums
Mandatory minimum sentences may be imposed only for the following offenses:
	•	murder or attempted murder;
	•	rape or aggravated sexual assault;
	•	sexual exploitation or abuse of children;
	•	human trafficking or forced labor;
	•	terrorism or mass-casualty violence;
	•	genocide or crimes against humanity;
	•	egregious public corruption or oathbreaking causing grave harm;
	•	repeat violent felony offenses demonstrating incorrigibility;
	•	Mass Financial Predation and Aggregated Economic Harm, where a person or coordinated group, acting with intent to defraud, deceive, or exploit, knowingly engages in conduct that:
a. causes aggregate financial harm exceeding an amount indexed annually to the national economy, defined as not less than 0.005% of Gross Domestic Product; or
b. extracts unlawful, deceptive, or coercive payments, fees, charges, or losses from ten thousand (10,000) or more persons, regardless of the per-person amount; or
c. systematically imposes small but unlawful losses through repetition, concealment, automation, or complexity, such that the conduct would be economically irrational if transparently disclosed to victims;
and where such harm results in widespread personal financial injury, loss of essential resources, or long-term economic insecurity not reasonably remediable through restitution alone;
	•	Institutional Fiduciary Betrayal and Exploitative Practices, where an individual or entity entrusted with fiduciary, custodial, managerial, or professional responsibility knowingly:
a. charges unlawful or deceptive fees;
b. sells knowingly defective, unsafe, adulterated, or fraudulent products or services;
c. uses unsafe ingredients, concealed risks, or falsified compliance; or
d. exploits informational asymmetry to impose harm victims cannot reasonably detect or avoid;
and where such conduct is systemic, repeated, or institutionalized, resulting in substantial harm to persons, families, or communities;
	•	Economic Sabotage and Deliberate Market Abuse, where intentional conduct, coordination, or manipulation is undertaken to:
a. destabilize essential markets, services, or supply chains;
b. exploit resulting harm for profit, leverage, or political power; or
c. impose widespread civilian economic harm functionally equivalent to a physical disaster;
	•	Systemic Laundering and Concealment of Predatory Proceeds, where financial instruments, corporate forms, trusts, shell entities, algorithms, or jurisdictional arbitrage are knowingly used to:
a. conceal, distribute, or legitimize proceeds derived from offenses described in subsections (9) through (11);
b. fragment liability to evade detection or accountability; or
c. externalize harm while privatizing gain;
	•	Data Exploitation and Harmful Transfer, where a person or entity knowingly sells, licenses, transfers, or provides access to personal, behavioral, biometric, financial, or communications data, and:
a. knows, or is willfully blind to the fact, that the recipient is likely to use such data for fraud, coercion, surveillance abuse, identity theft, extortion, manipulation, or other serious harm to persons; or
b. transfers such data to foreign entities, jurisdictions, or intermediaries lacking meaningful legal safeguards, where misuse is reasonably foreseeable; or
c. structures data transfers to evade domestic protections, oversight, or accountability;
liability under this subsection shall attach regardless of whether the data transfer is nominally lawful, where intent, knowledge, or deliberate indifference to foreseeable harm is established.

c. Prohibition on Mandatory Minimums for Nonviolent Offenses
Mandatory minimums are prohibited for:
	•	nonviolent drug possession;
	•	offenses driven primarily by addiction or mental illness;
	•	first-time nonviolent offenses;
	•	regulatory or economic violations absent predation, intent, and human harm.

The Republic shall not punish weakness as wickedness.

d. Judicial Findings and Tier Alignment
Any mandatory minimum sentence imposed shall:
	•	correspond to Tier Two or Tier Three placement;
	•	be accompanied by explicit judicial findings on the record;
	•	state the public-safety and moral-clarity justification served by the minimum.

Courts retain discretion above the minimum.

e. Prohibition on Prosecutorial Manipulation
Mandatory minimums may not be used to:
	•	coerce guilty pleas;
	•	threaten disproportionate punishment;
	•	stack charges to induce fear;
	•	circumvent the right to trial.

Any attempt to leverage mandatory minimums as bargaining tools constitutes prosecutorial misconduct.

f. Truth-in-Sentencing Requirement
Any mandatory minimum imposed shall represent real time to be served.

Artificial sentencing practices, including:
	•	inflated sentences paired with routine early release;
	•	nominal minimums routinely waived administratively;
	•	sentence credits that nullify the minimum;
are prohibited.

g. Limited Judicial Mitigation
Extraordinary mitigation below a mandatory minimum may occur only when:
	•	factual innocence of aggravating elements is proven;
	•	new exculpatory evidence emerges;
	•	constitutional violations materially affected sentencing;
	•	unanimous judicial findings justify departure.

All departures must be written, published, and subject to appeal.

h. No Administrative Override
No executive, correctional, or administrative authority may:
	•	suspend a mandatory minimum;
	•	convert it into a noncustodial sentence;
	•	nullify it through regulation or policy.

Only courts may alter sentences.

i. Review and Correction
Mandatory minimum sentences remain subject to:
	•	appellate review for legal error;
	•	correction upon proof of innocence;
	•	relief for unconstitutional application.

Mandatory does not mean infallible.

j. Prohibition on Expansion
No legislature, court, or agency may expand mandatory minimum sentencing to new offenses by statute, rule, or interpretation.

Expansion requires constitutional amendment.

k. Limitation, Indexing, and Judicial Findings for Economic and Data Crimes
Mandatory minimum sentencing under subsections (9) through (13) shall apply only where the court makes explicit findings, on the record, that:
	•	the conduct was intentional, predatory, and exploitative, not negligent, mistaken, or incidental;
	•	harm resulted to persons, not merely abstract markets or speculative losses;
	•	the defendant knowingly relied on scale, repetition, concealment, automation, complexity, or institutional distance to magnify harm or suppress resistance;
	•	prosecution is not based solely on technical regulatory violation absent demonstrable human harm; and
	•	the offense warrants Tier Three alignment under Section 2A or Section 6 due to moral culpability and danger to the Republic.

Economic thresholds referenced herein shall be indexed annually by statute to objective national economic indicators and may not be frozen, waived, or administratively altered.

Failure to make such findings prohibits application of mandatory minimums under these subsections.

l. Knowing Enablement Standard
For purposes of subsections (9) through (13), a person or entity shall be deemed to have acted with predatory intent where it knowingly provides, maintains, customizes, optimizes, or supports infrastructure, technology, hardware, software, data, or expertise, and knows or is willfully blind to the fact that such support is being used primarily to commit fraud, exploitation, surveillance abuse, or mass economic harm to persons.

Neutral provision of goods or services shall not suffice absent such knowledge, deliberate ignorance, or continued support after credible notice of misuse.

m. Limitation on Ordinary Commerce
Ordinary commercial transactions conducted in good faith, with meaningful consent, reasonable safeguards, and prompt termination upon credible notice of misuse, shall not give rise to liability under subsections (9) through (13).

n. Constitutional Minimum Floors
For offenses subject to mandatory minimum sentencing under this Section, no sentence may fall below the following constitutional floors:
	•	Murder (intentional): not less than 25 years of incarceration;
	•	Rape or aggravated sexual assault: not less than 15 years;
	•	Sexual exploitation of a child: not less than 20 years;
	•	Human trafficking involving coercion or minors: not less than 20 years;
	•	Terrorism or mass-casualty violence: not less than 25 years;
	•	Genocide or crimes against humanity: not less than 30 years;
	•	Egregious public corruption or oathbreaking causing grave harm: not less than 10 years;
	•	Repeat violent felony offenders (third qualifying offense): not less than 15 years.

No statute, regulation, plea agreement, or administrative action may reduce these floors. Legislatures may impose higher minimums consistent with proportionality and this Constitution.

As Scripture teaches:
“Do not move the ancient boundary stone set by your forefathers.”
Section 13. Oversight, Data, and AI Compliance

a. Independent Justice Oversight Board

A permanent, independent Justice Oversight Board shall be established to monitor the integrity, fairness, and effectiveness of the criminal justice system under this Article.

The Board shall be composed of individuals of demonstrated integrity and competence, including but not limited to:
	•	retired judges;
	•	former prosecutors and defense attorneys;
	•	criminologists;
	•	victim advocates;
	•	civil liberties experts;
	•	forensic and data integrity specialists.

No active political officeholder, active prosecutor, active law enforcement officer, or active corporate executive subject to criminal jurisdiction under this Article may serve on the Board.

b. Scope of Authority

The Justice Oversight Board shall have authority to:
	•	audit sentencing practices for tier compliance, proportionality, and consistency;
	•	review restitution enforcement effectiveness;
	•	monitor parole, probation, and sentence reduction decisions for compliance with statutory caps and prohibitions;
	•	review wrongful conviction data and compensation compliance;
	•	inspect confinement conditions for constitutional compliance;
	•	investigate systemic abuse, evasion, or corruption within justice institutions;
	•	issue binding corrective directives where constitutional violations are found, subject to judicial review.

c. Mandatory Public Reporting

The Board shall publish annual public reports, at minimum, detailing:
	•	tier placement statistics;
	•	sentence lengths and actual time served;
	•	parole and early-release grants and denials by tier;
	•	recidivism rates by offense category and tier;
	•	restitution ordered versus restitution collected;
	•	wrongful conviction claims, exonerations, and compensation paid;
	•	civil confinement placements and releases;
	•	prosecutorial misconduct findings and sanctions.

Reports shall be anonymized where necessary to protect victims and due process, but may not conceal systemic patterns, institutional failures, or aggregate outcomes.

d. Data Integrity and Transparency

All criminal justice data relied upon for policymaking, sentencing analysis, or oversight shall be:
	•	accurate;
	•	auditable;
	•	retained for no fewer than thirty years;
	•	protected against alteration, deletion, or concealment.

Intentional falsification, suppression, or manipulation of justice data constitutes grave official misconduct and shall be prosecuted as such.

e. AI and Algorithmic System Constraints

Artificial intelligence, algorithmic risk assessment tools, predictive policing systems, sentencing software, or similar technologies may be used only in an advisory capacity.

No AI system may:
	•	determine guilt or innocence;
	•	mandate tier placement;
	•	impose or reduce sentences;
	•	override judicial findings;
	•	deny parole, probation, or release.

f. Transparency and Auditability of AI Systems

Any AI or algorithmic system used in the criminal justice process must:
	•	be publicly documented;
	•	disclose inputs, outputs, error rates, and known limitations;
	•	permit independent audit and replication;
	•	be free from proprietary secrecy that prevents meaningful review.

Black-box systems are prohibited.

g. Human Accountability Requirement

All final decisions affecting liberty, confinement, punishment, or release must be made by accountable human decision-makers.

No official may evade responsibility by deferring to an algorithm, model, or automated recommendation.

h. Prohibition on Predictive Punishment

No person may be punished, confined, escalated in tier, or denied release based solely or primarily on:
	•	statistical risk profiles;
	•	group-based predictive models;
	•	demographic correlations;
	•	speculative future conduct.

Punishment must be grounded in proven conduct, adjudicated facts, and lawful findings.

i. Enforcement and Sanctions

Failure to comply with this Section, including obstruction of audits, falsification of data, or misuse of AI systems, constitutes:
	•	official misconduct;
	•	grounds for removal from office;
	•	criminal liability where harm results.

j. Interpretation

This Section shall be interpreted to ensure that justice remains visible, accountable, transparent, and human-governed, and that technology serves the law rather than replaces it.

Oversight is not distrust of justice; it is fidelity to it.

Section 14. Juvenile Justice and Age-Based Culpability

a. Principle of Developmental Accountability

The Republic recognizes that children and adolescents possess developing judgment, impulse control, and moral reasoning. Juvenile justice shall account for immaturity without excusing serious harm.

Youth mitigates culpability, but does not erase responsibility.

b. Definition of Juvenile Status

A juvenile is a person under the age of eighteen at the time of the offense, unless otherwise provided by law for specific crimes.

Age shall be determined objectively and may not be manipulated to evade accountability or enhance punishment.

c. Presumption of Rehabilitation

Juvenile offenders are presumed capable of rehabilitation, particularly for nonviolent offenses.

Juvenile justice shall prioritize:
	•	education;
	•	treatment;
	•	family involvement;
	•	moral formation;
	•	accountability appropriate to age.

Punishment that permanently forecloses reform is disfavored for youth.

d. Limits of Leniency

Juvenile status does not excuse:
	•	murder;
	•	rape or aggravated sexual assault;
	•	armed robbery;
	•	terrorism;
	•	repeated violent offenses;
	•	predatory conduct demonstrating adult-level intent.

In such cases, courts may impose severe sanctions consistent with public safety and constitutional protections.

e. Transfer to Adult Court

A juvenile may be tried as an adult only upon judicial finding, entered on the record, that:
	•	the offense demonstrates adult-level intent or violence;
	•	the juvenile poses a continuing danger to the public;
	•	juvenile dispositions are inadequate to protect society;
	•	mitigating developmental factors have been fully considered.

Transfer shall never be automatic.

f. Sentencing of Juveniles Tried as Adults

Juveniles convicted in adult court shall receive sentences reflecting:
	•	the seriousness of the offense;
	•	developmental capacity at the time of the offense;
	•	potential for reform;
	•	the need for public protection.

Life imprisonment without review is disfavored and shall be subject to periodic judicial reassessment.

g. Conditions of Confinement

Juveniles shall not be confined with adult offenders except where necessary for safety and security.

Facilities housing juveniles shall emphasize:
	•	education;
	•	discipline;
	•	psychological and psychiatric care;
	•	moral instruction;
	•	preparation for lawful adulthood.

Abuse, neglect, or exploitation of juvenile detainees constitutes a grave offense.

h. Rights of Juvenile Victims

Juvenile victims shall receive enhanced protections consistent with Section 4, including:
	•	trauma-informed procedures;
	•	privacy safeguards;
	•	specialized advocates;
	•	expedited proceedings where appropriate.

The youth of the offender shall not eclipse the youth of the victim.

i. Sealing and Expungement

Records of juvenile offenses shall be sealed upon completion of sentence or disposition, except where:
	•	the offense was violent;
	•	the offense was sexual;
	•	the offender was tried as an adult.

Sealing shall not erase access for courts or law enforcement acting within lawful purposes.

j. Transition to Adulthood

Courts shall ensure that juveniles completing dispositions receive:
	•	educational placement;
	•	vocational training;
	•	mental health support;
	•	supervised reintegration where appropriate.

The goal of juvenile justice is lawful adulthood, not permanent marginalization.

k. Interpretation

This Section shall be interpreted to balance mercy with responsibility, rehabilitation with restraint, and youth with justice.

As Scripture teaches:
“Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.”

Section 15. Tier Two Escalation, Persistent Criminality, and Hard-Labor Remediation

a. Purpose

This Section addresses offenders initially classified under Tier Two who, after genuine access to rehabilitative opportunities, demonstrate persistent criminality, refusal of reform, or contempt for lawful authority. The Republic shall not permit indefinite cycling through failed rehabilitation where public safety and moral order are compromised.

b. Threshold for Escalation

A Tier Two offender becomes eligible for escalation under this Section upon judicial finding, entered on the record, that:
	•	the offender has repeatedly failed structured rehabilitative programs despite reasonable opportunity and support;
	•	the offender has committed new serious offenses, engaged in deception, or materially violated conditions of confinement or release;
	•	the offender demonstrates a settled criminal mindset, evidenced by conduct, statements, or pattern of behavior; and
	•	lesser corrective measures have proven ineffective to protect the public or restore order.

Escalation shall never be automatic and shall require individualized findings.

c. Seven-Year Hard-Labor Escalation

Upon satisfaction of subsection (b), the court may impose an additional fixed term of up to seven (7) years of confinement emphasizing hard labor, beyond the otherwise applicable Tier Two sentence, subject to the following constraints:
	•	labor shall be physically demanding, disciplined, and socially useful, including infrastructure repair, environmental remediation, or other public works;
	•	labor conditions shall remain humane, safe, and medically supervised, consistent with Section 7 stewardship standards;
	•	refusal to labor without medical justification constitutes misconduct and may result in further disciplinary sanctions consistent with law;
	•	this additional term shall not be reduced through administrative credits, routine parole, or earned release mechanisms.

The purpose of this escalation is moral confrontation and character reformation, not vengeance.

d. Opportunity for Redemption

During the escalation term, the offender may earn judicial reconsideration only upon clear and convincing evidence of:
	•	sustained behavioral transformation;
	•	full compliance with labor and restitution obligations;
	•	demonstrated leadership, responsibility, or mentorship within lawful confines; and
	•	credible expert assessment supporting reduced risk of reoffense.

Reconsideration may reduce future restrictions but shall not erase accountability already imposed.

e. Limits and Safeguards

This Section shall not apply to:
	•	offenders whose failure to rehabilitate is primarily attributable to untreated mental incapacity qualifying under Section 9;
	•	offenders whose original placement should have been Tier Three due to misclassification, which shall instead be corrected directly;
	•	nonviolent offenders absent proof of persistent, willful criminality.

f. Relationship to Tier Three

Escalation under this Section does not itself convert a Tier Two offender into Tier Three status. However, conduct justifying escalation may independently support Tier Three review under Sections 6 and 9B where applicable.

g. Interpretation

This Section shall be interpreted to ensure that the Republic does not abandon rehabilitation prematurely, yet does not tolerate endless failure where decisive correction may yet reclaim the offender or protect society.

Hard labor is imposed not to break the body, but to confront the will.
Section 16. Supremacy and Anti-Evasion (Final Interpretation Clause)

No provision of this Article shall be interpreted, construed, applied, or administered in a manner that subordinates:
	•	the protection of the innocent,
	•	the restraint of the dangerous,
	•	the restoration of victims, or
	•	the preservation of moral clarity

to procedural convenience, ideological presumption, fiscal consideration, administrative efficiency, political expediency, institutional self-interest, or abstraction.

Any ambiguity, conflict, or silence within this Article shall be resolved in favor of truth, public safety, victim restoration, proportional accountability, and moral seriousness, consistent with the purposes declared herein.

No authority—judicial, executive, legislative, corporate, or administrative—may evade, dilute, nullify, or undermine the requirements, prohibitions, floors, caps, presumptions, or duties established by this Article through:
	•	creative interpretation;
	•	reclassification, abstraction, or jurisdictional arbitrage;
	•	procedural manipulation or delay;
	•	regulatory substitution for criminal accountability;
	•	privatization of punishment or concealment of enforcement; or
	•	claims of necessity, novelty, or technological inevitability.

Attempts to circumvent the letter or spirit of this Article constitute grave offenses against the Republic, subject to sanction under applicable criminal, civil, and constitutional law.
This Article shall prevail over all inconsistent statutes, regulations, policies, contracts, agreements, technological systems, or administrative practices.

Justice shall not be optional.
Protection shall not be negotiable.
And no power shall stand above the law.



Section 16. Proportional Temporal Sanctions

Where a convicted person possesses a natural or artificial lifespan, regenerative capacity, continuity of consciousness, or temporal endurance substantially exceeding that of ordinary humans, sentencing shall be proportionally adjusted to preserve equivalent deterrence, accountability, and moral weight.

No sentence shall be rendered trivial by extraordinary longevity, nor transformed into perpetual or infinite suffering by immortality or indefinite persistence.

Courts may impose fractional-lifespan sentences, epoch-based sanctions, indeterminate confinement with mandatory periodic review, operational suspension, dormancy, or trusteeship, as necessary to preserve public safety, constitutional order, and proportional justice.

Sentencing shall account for the convicted person’s capacity for delayed action, long-term manipulation, or exploitation of institutional memory.
Incapacitation of non-human persons may include enforced dormancy, computational suspension, instance sequestration, network isolation, trusteeship, or controlled execution of code, subject to proportionality and review.
Section 17. Sentencing of Unitary and Distributed Non-Human Persons

Where a convicted person operates under unitary agency, sanctions shall apply to the person as a whole. All physical embodiments, instances, or operational manifestations may be collectively restrained, confined, transferred, suspended, or placed under trusteeship for the duration of sentence.

Where a convicted person operates under distributed agency, sanctions shall attach only to culpable components, instances, or agents, unless unified intent or coordinated action is proven.

Courts are authorized to attribute responsibility to the highest level of effective control where architectural design is used to evade accountability.

Addendum: Protective Containment, Impairment, and Proportionality
(Doctrinal Clarification — Addendum Only)

Section A. Protective Containment Distinguished from Punishment

The temporary apprehension, restraint, or containment of an individual under the Capacity-Based Intervention Principle shall be deemed protective and preventive in nature, and not criminal punishment, provided that:

a. No adjudication of guilt has occurred, and
b. The restraint is imposed solely to prevent imminent and substantial harm, and
c. All procedural safeguards and time limitations required by the Constitution are observed.

Protective containment shall not, by itself, give rise to criminal liability, enhanced sentencing, or civil disability.


Section B. Impairment and Criminal Responsibility

The presence of intoxication, addiction, psychiatric illness, or neurological impairment shall not excuse criminal conduct once an offense has been committed.

However, such impairment may justify preemptive protective containment prior to the commission of a crime where imminent danger is clearly demonstrated, consistent with constitutional doctrine.

Criminal responsibility shall attach upon the commission of a prohibited act with the requisite mental state as defined by law.

Voluntary or self-induced impairment shall not be considered a mitigating factor in sentencing, and may be considered only for purposes of establishing recklessness, aggravation, or enhanced culpability.

Section C. Sentencing Accountability for Knowing Impairment

Where an individual knowingly places themselves into a state of impairment and, while so impaired, causes serious harm to persons or property, the law may impose sentencing enhancements reflecting the elevated and voluntary risk created by such conduct.

Such enhancements shall be:

a. Proportional to the harm caused,
b. Clearly defined by statute, and
c. Applied without regard to moral judgment or stigma concerning addiction or illness.

Section D. Proportionality for Extended or Non-Human Lifespans

To preserve the moral and deterrent function of punishment across radically unequal lifespans, the law may provide for proportional sentencing multipliers or alternative equivalency measures for:

a. Exceptionally long-lived persons, or
b. Immortal or effectively immortal beings subject to criminal jurisdiction.

Such measures shall ensure that punishment remains meaningful, finite, and non-arbitrary, and shall never authorize eternal or indeterminate punishment.

Section E. Cross-Reference and Controlling Doctrine

This addendum shall be interpreted in full conformity with the Capacity-Based Intervention Principle, which governs pre-criminal containment, evidentiary standards, and procedural safeguards.

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to expand preventive detention beyond the limits imposed by that Principle.

Section F. Locking Clause

This addendum clarifies interpretation only and does not reopen or amend the underlying text of Article VII.
Upon adoption, Article VII shall remain locked and subject to modification only by formal constitutional amendment.
All deprivations of liberty or property as punishment, or as temporary protective measures, shall comply fully with Article II (Sections 0, 5, 5A) and Article 0 definitions. No punishment or restriction may be imposed based solely on diagnosis, status, or speculation absent individualized, evidence-based findings.



Article VII-A — Supplemental Doctrines, Clarifications, and Enforcement Safeguards

Section 1. Non-Derogation and Additive Effect

This Article supplements Article VII — Crime, Justice, and Penal Philosophy.

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to repeal, narrow, condition, or displace any provision, prohibition, tier, penalty, or safeguard contained in Article VII.

Silence in this Article shall not be interpreted as authorization to weaken, soften, or reinterpret Article VII.

⸻

Section 2. Structural and Institutional Crimes

Conduct that produces grave harm through institutional design, algorithmic systems, bureaucratic processes, or organizational concealment shall constitute criminal conduct where intent, recklessness, or knowing indifference is established.

Criminal liability under this Section may attach to architects, designers, executives, beneficiaries, enforcers, or concealers of such systems, regardless of formal distance from the resulting harm.

Diffuse responsibility, delegation, automation, or procedural layering shall not defeat liability.

This Section supplements, and does not limit, the crimes and tiers enumerated in Article VII.

⸻

Section 3. Prohibition on Procedural Escape for Heinous Crimes

Where guilt for a heinous offense, as defined in Article VII, is established beyond reasonable doubt, procedural violations shall not require dismissal of charges or release of the offender, provided that:
	1.	the evidence of guilt is independently reliable; and
	2.	responsible officials are separately investigated, sanctioned, and, where appropriate, criminally prosecuted.

This Section shall not be construed to excuse misconduct by the State, but to prevent procedural failure from transferring harm back to victims or the public.

⸻

Section 4. Truth-in-Sentencing Lock

Where Article VII prescribes a sentence, sentencing floor, or mandatory confinement period, no administrative, discretionary, or procedural mechanism shall reduce actual time served below that floor except as expressly authorized by this Constitution.

Parole, earned release, reclassification, or compassionate mechanisms shall not be used to nullify sentencing requirements imposed under Article VII.

Truth in sentencing is a constitutional obligation, not a policy preference.

⸻

Section 5. Objective Compensation for Wrongful Conviction

Any person wrongfully convicted or confined shall be entitled to compensation as a matter of constitutional right.

Compensation shall be calculated using objective baselines established by law, including but not limited to:
	1.	duration of confinement;
	2.	conditions of confinement;
	3.	loss of liberty, opportunity, and earning capacity;
	4.	collateral harm to family, reputation, and civil standing.

This entitlement shall not depend on proof of malice or misconduct by officials.

⸻

Section 6. Judicial Truth-Seeking Authority (Fenced)

Courts possess authority to seek truth within the bounds of established evidentiary rules and procedures.

This authority does not permit courts to:
	1.	invent facts not in evidence;
	2.	substitute judicial theories for evidentiary proof;
	3.	cure prosecutorial failure by judicial reconstruction of the case;
	4.	bypass constitutional protections governing proof and admissibility.

Truth-seeking shall operate within, not above, the rule of law.

⸻

Section 7. Victim Standing for Limited Review

Victims of crime, or their lawful representatives, shall have standing to seek limited judicial review of:
	1.	unlawful dismissal of charges;
	2.	failure to apply mandatory tiers or sentencing floors;
	3.	unauthorized sentence reductions or releases.

Review under this Section shall be procedural and deferential, and shall not authorize private prosecution or de novo retrial.

⸻

Section 8. Admissibility and Reliability (Narrowed Rule)

In cases involving heinous crimes under Article VII, reliable evidence shall not be excluded solely on the basis of technical defect, provided that:
	1.	reliability is independently established;
	2.	admission is necessary to prevent manifest injustice; and
	3.	officials responsible for unlawful acquisition are fully subject to sanction and prosecution.

This Section shall not be construed to authorize routine disregard of constitutional protections.

⸻

Section 9. Anti-Evasion and Anti-Laundering Principle

No doctrine of equity, mercy, efficiency, emergency, humanitarian concern, or administrative convenience shall be used to evade or nullify the penalties, tiers, or incapacitation requirements of Article VII.

Any mechanism that has the effect of systematically undermining Article VII shall be void.

⸻

Section 10. Structural Harm as Personal Harm

Where harm arises from systems or policies that predictably inflict injury at scale, such harm shall be treated as personal harm to each affected individual for purposes of standing, liability, and remedy.

Scale shall not diminish culpability.

⸻

Section 11. Transparency and Record Integrity

All proceedings, findings, classifications, and sentence calculations conducted under Article VII or this Article shall be recorded, preserved, and made publicly accessible in accordance with Article VI-E and Article XXXIX.

Secrecy shall not be used to shield systemic failure or institutional crime.

⸻

Section 12. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to reinforce, not dilute, the moral clarity, victim primacy, incapacitation mandates, and truth obligations of Article VII.

Where doubt exists, the construction that preserves the full force of Article VII shall control.

⸻

Article VIII — Economic Structure and Stewardship (Authoritative)

Charge
This Article establishes the constitutional framework governing the economic structure of the Republic, including currency, taxation, labor, land use, trade, public assistance, and market regulation. All provisions of this Article shall be construed to promote productive economic participation, prevent systemic exploitation or capture, and preserve economic conditions consistent with democratic self-government. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to authorize economic control, compulsion, or restriction except as expressly provided herein and subject to constitutional limitations.

Legal Text

Section 1. Purpose and First Principles

(a) Economic Stewardship
The economy of the Republic exists to sustain life; reward productive labor; support families; preserve national independence; enable lawful enterprise; and prevent exploitation, dependency, and oligarchy. Markets are tools, not masters.

(b) Human-Centered Economy
Economic policy shall recognize that labor is not a commodity; land is finite and sacred; currency is a public trust; capital must serve production; and families are the foundation of prosperity. No economic system may treat people as disposable inputs.

(c) Productive Labor
The Republic shall favor work that produces tangible goods or essential services; skilled trades, agriculture, engineering, medicine, care, education, scientific research, infrastructure maintenance, and lawful administration; enterprises that train, employ, and retain citizens; and ownership models that reward contribution rather than speculation. Rent-seeking without productive contribution is disfavored.

(d) National Resilience
The economy shall be structured to ensure food security; energy independence; industrial capability; domestic supply chains for essential goods; and resistance to foreign economic coercion. No Republic may outsource its survival.

(e) Moral Restraints
Economic freedom does not extend to fraud, coercion, predatory lending, debt bondage, market manipulation, monopolistic capture, or extraction of value without reciprocal contribution. Profit divorced from responsibility is corruption.

(f) Federal Role
The federal government shall set constitutional guardrails, preserve fair competition, prevent systemic risk, enforce transparency, protect the productive classes, and refrain from micromanagement best left to local economies. Central control shall be limited; national stewardship shall be firm.

(g) State and Local Authority
States and local governments retain broad authority over zoning and land use, local commerce, cooperative enterprises, regional development, and labor standards consistent with this Constitution. Economic subsidiarity is preferred.

(h) Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to prevent financial oligarchy, debt-based domination, generational dispossession, speculative collapse, and the reduction of citizens to serfs. As it is written: “The borrower is servant to the lender,” therefore a free people must never surrender stewardship of their economy.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to audit economic systems, regulatory regimes, financial structures, and enforcement patterns for institutional capture, coordinated evasion, oligarchic consolidation, or parasitic wealth extraction, and may petition the Constitutional Review Court for injunctive, structural, or dissolution remedies.

Section 2. Currency, Money, and Debt

(a) Monetary Sovereignty
Monetary authority belongs solely to the Republic. The power to issue, regulate, and retire currency shall never be delegated to private institutions, foreign entities, or supranational bodies. Money is a public instrument, not a private weapon.

(b) Lawful National Currency
The Republic shall maintain a lawful national currency administered transparently by the Treasury. The currency shall serve as a medium of exchange; function as a unit of account; preserve value over time; facilitate productive commerce; and remain comprehensible to the People. Currency shall not exist primarily as debt.

(c) Prohibition on Central Banking Cartels
No system resembling a central bank, federal reserve, monetary authority, or privately controlled issuance body shall be established, tolerated, or revived. This includes private control of interest rates, opaque monetary committees, debt-based currency monopolies, and bailouts without public accountability. Secret money creation is forbidden.

(d) Transparency of Monetary Policy
The Treasury shall publish total money supply, issuance schedules, reserve holdings, inflation and deflation metrics, outstanding public debt, and all monetary instruments in circulation. All monetary actions shall be auditable and subject to legislative and judicial review.

(e) Limits on Debt
Public debt shall be incurred only for national defense; catastrophic disaster response; essential infrastructure of lasting value; or existential emergencies certified by Congress. Existential emergencies shall require a formal declaration specifying scope, duration, and necessity, subject to review by the Constitutional Review Court and automatic expiration.

(f) Interest and Usury
Interest shall be permitted only as compensation for risk and time, not as domination. The Republic may regulate or prohibit usurious lending, compound interest structures that guarantee perpetual indebtedness, predatory credit instruments, and debt traps targeting the poor or desperate. Debt shall never enslave.

(g) Banking as Service, Not Sovereignty
Banks may exist only as custodians of deposits, lenders of disclosed capital, and facilitators of exchange. They shall not create money ex nihilo, operate with implicit state guarantees, privatize gains while socializing losses, or wield political power through financial leverage. Failure shall be allowed.

(h) Bankruptcy and Reset
The Republic shall maintain orderly bankruptcy mechanisms to discharge unpayable debts, restore productive participation, prevent lifetime bondage, and reset failed enterprises without systemic collapse. Forgiveness restores economic life.

Section 3. Taxation Limits and Revenue Structure

(a) Purpose of Taxation
Taxation exists solely to fund the legitimate functions of the Republic. It shall not be used for social engineering, punishment, favoritism, or economic coercion. Revenue shall be raised with restraint and clarity.

(b) Permissible Federal Taxes
The federal government may levy only trade tariffs, consumption and sales taxes, excise taxes on harmful or luxury goods, narrowly tailored environmental remediation fees, and fees for voluntary government services.

(c) Prohibition on Income and Wealth Taxes
The federal government shall not levy income taxes on labor, taxes on unrealized gains, wealth taxes, inheritance or estate taxes, head taxes, or taxes based on personal status.

(d) Tax Rate Caps
Total federal taxation shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the value of any taxable transaction or good. Congress may authorize a temporary increase of up to five percent (5%) for declared national emergencies or major wars by supermajority vote, with automatic sunset after five years.

(e) Transparency and Accountability
All taxes shall be plainly disclosed at point of collection, auditable, traceable to authorized expenditures, and published in annual revenue reports. Hidden taxation is fraud.

Section 4. Labor, Wages, and Worker Dignity

(a) Dignity of Labor
Productive labor is honorable and essential to the life of the Republic. All lawful work that contributes materially or socially to the common good shall be respected and protected. Workers shall not be treated as disposable inputs.

(b) Right to Work and Earn
All lawful residents possess the right to seek, accept, and perform honest work without coercion or artificial exclusion. Licensure shall not be used to create cartels.

(c) Fair Compensation
Workers are entitled to compensation sufficient to sustain life, support family formation, allow modest savings, and reflect skill, effort, and risk. Compensation shall not be suppressed through collusion, monopsony, or coercive dependency.
Sufficiency shall be assessed with reference to local cost of living and regional economic conditions.

(d) Collective Organization
Workers may organize freely to bargain collectively, form associations or guilds, and advocate for safety and fairness. No organization may compel membership, dues, or political activity as a condition of employment.

(e) Pseudo-Work Clarification
Pseudo-work refers to economic activity that exists solely to extract rents, manipulate systems, or perpetuate itself without material, social, or productive contribution. Pseudo-work shall not include lawful administrative, educational, scientific, caregiving, creative, analytical, or coordination roles that demonstrably support productive enterprise, public safety, health, knowledge creation, or social stability.

(f) Maximum Pay Ratio
No enterprise operating within the Republic and employing more than a de minimis number of workers may provide guaranteed annual compensation to any individual exceeding fifty (50) times the guaranteed annual compensation of its lowest-paid full-time worker. Guaranteed compensation includes salary, wages, cash bonuses, guaranteed incentives, deferred compensation, severance, pensions, and personal-use property provided by the enterprise. Equity ownership, founder shares, stock options, capital gains, and dividends earned proportionally to ownership are excluded.

The de minimis threshold shall not exceed twenty-five (25) full-time equivalent workers.

This ratio may not be evaded through outsourcing, labor reclassification, shell entities, or artificial contractor structures. Executives must hold vested equity for at least five years and may not hedge positions.

Violation constitutes unlawful operation and may result in loss of charter, fines, or restitution to underpaid workers.
Compliance with constitutional compensation ratios shall constitute a complete defense against claims of fiduciary breach.

Section 5. Land, Housing, and Anti-Speculation

(a) First Principle of Land
Land is finite, foundational, and essential to life. It shall be treated as a trust to be stewarded, not merely a commodity to be extracted.

(b) Right to Property
Citizens and lawful residents possess the right to acquire, own, use, and transfer property subject to reasonable regulation consistent with this Constitution.

(c) Anti-Speculation Measures
The Republic may regulate or restrict large-scale acquisition of residential property by institutional investors, bulk ownership that inflates housing costs, vacancy hoarding, and speculative practices disconnected from improvement.

(d) Occupancy and Use
Buildings and developed land suitable for habitation or lawful enterprise shall not be left vacant for more than twelve (12) consecutive months without just cause. Just causes include active renovation, lawful transition of ownership, seasonal use, certified hardship, or safety remediation.

(e) Temporary Stewardship Transfer
Temporary stewardship transfer shall not convey title, equity, or permanent control. It shall exist solely to restore lawful use following authorization by the Constitutional Review Court, for a defined duration not exceeding five years, after which full possession shall revert to the owner, with just compensation where required.

(f) Prohibition on Artificial Scarcity
No owner or consortium may coordinate vacancy or land banking to manipulate rents or withhold entire districts from use. Such conduct constitutes market manipulation.

Section 6. Trade, Tariffs, and National Industry

(a) Fair Trade Principle
Trade shall increase prosperity and peace without hollowing domestic industry, enslaving labor abroad, or creating permanent dependency.

(b) Strategic Industries
Industries essential to national survival, security, or independence shall be protected and maintained domestically.

(c) Anti-Offshoring Abuse
No enterprise may offshore production solely to evade standards and then re-import goods while enjoying domestic legal privileges or public subsidy.

Section 7. Welfare, Assistance, and Anti-Dependence

(a) Purpose of Assistance
The Republic affirms a duty to aid the vulnerable while restoring dignity, stability, and productive participation.

(b) Reciprocity
Able-bodied adults receiving long-term assistance shall contribute through work, training, public service, rehabilitation, or caregiving where capacity exists.

(c) Protection of the Vulnerable
No work requirement shall apply to the severely disabled, the elderly, or primary caregivers where no alternative exists.

(d) Review and Sunset
All assistance programs shall include objectives, sunset provisions, periodic review, and public reporting.

(e) Interpretation
Mercy shall not become indulgence, nor support surrender.

Addendum — Definitions and Construction
	•	Rent-Seeking
Rent-seeking refers to the extraction of income, advantage, or control through legal privilege, monopoly power, artificial scarcity, financial manipulation, or regulatory capture without proportional productive contribution to goods or services.
	•	Parasitic Wealth Extraction
Parasitic wealth extraction refers to sustained economic gain derived primarily from exploiting dependency, asymmetry of power, or enforced scarcity rather than from productive enterprise or value creation.
	•	Productive Labor
Productive labor includes work that materially or socially contributes to goods, services, infrastructure, care, knowledge, safety, or the lawful functioning of society.
	•	Systemic Risk
Systemic risk refers to financial, industrial, or supply-chain conditions whose failure would threaten national stability, public welfare, or sovereign independence.
	•	Federal–State Boundary
In cases of conflict, federal authority under this Article shall extend only to preventing oligarchy, systemic risk, national dependency, or market manipulation, and shall not be construed to standardize local economic life beyond those guardrails.
Addendum: Illegitimate Use of Cultural Assets

Section A. Art and Antiquities as Instruments of Corruption

The use of art, antiquities, cultural artifacts, or historically significant objects as instruments for money laundering, concealment of criminal proceeds, sanctions evasion, tax evasion, or storage of opaque and unaccountable wealth constitutes parasitic wealth extraction and an economic crime against the Republic.

Such conduct extracts value without productive contribution, obscures honest scales, and corrodes the moral foundations of commerce.

Section B. No Cultural Exemption from Economic Justice

No claim of artistic merit, cultural prestige, collectible status, or heritage significance shall exempt any asset or transaction from lawful provenance, transparent ownership, and economic accountability under this Article.

Wealth that hides in shadows, trades on secrecy, or cloaks itself in false reverence is not stewardship, but deceit.

Section C. Construction

This addendum shall be construed to affirm that wealth exists to serve life and truth, not to evade justice; that honest measures delight the Lord; and that no market, however rarefied, may place itself above the moral law that binds all commerce within the Republic.
Article VIII-A — Supplemental Economic Doctrines and Safeguards

Section 1. Non-Derogation and Additive Effect

This Article supplements Article VIII — Economic Structure and Stewardship.

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to repeal, narrow, suspend, condition, or reinterpret any provision, prohibition, cap, ratio, or safeguard established in Article VIII.

Silence in this Article shall not be construed as authorization to weaken, evade, or dilute Article VIII.

⸻

Section 2. Lawful Private and Alternative Exchange Systems

The People retain the right to engage in lawful private exchange systems, including but not limited to:
	1.	commodity-backed currencies;
	2.	mutual credit systems;
	3.	barter and local exchange networks;
	4.	cryptographic or digital exchange instruments.

Such systems shall be lawful provided that they do not:
	1.	claim legal tender status by coercion;
	2.	impersonate public currency;
	3.	evade lawful taxation;
	4.	function as instruments of fraud, coercion, or concealment.

Nothing in this Section shall be construed to diminish the Republic’s monetary sovereignty or to authorize a central banking cartel prohibited under Article VIII.

⸻

Section 3. Prohibition on Monetary Manipulation

No public authority shall engage in monetary manipulation, including but not limited to:
	1.	hidden debasement;
	2.	inflationary dilution for political ends;
	3.	opaque monetary expansion;
	4.	covert redistribution through currency distortion.

Monetary instruments shall not be used to conceal insolvency, evade fiscal discipline, or transfer wealth without transparent legislative authorization.

Violation of this Section constitutes economic misconduct against the People.

⸻

Section 4. Constitutional Debt Sustainability Doctrine

Public debt shall remain subordinate to productive capacity and generational equity.

In addition to the substantive restrictions imposed by Article VIII, no public borrowing may be incurred that:
	1.	exceeds sustainable ratios relative to national productive output, as defined by law using publicly disclosed methodologies;
	2.	binds future generations absent compelling necessity;
	3.	conceals long-term obligations through off-balance-sheet instruments.

Any override of statutory debt limits shall require heightened legislative thresholds and full public disclosure.

⸻

Section 5. Bad-Faith Offshoring and Re-Importation Prohibited

Offshoring of labor, production, or capital undertaken for the primary purpose of evading constitutional labor standards, environmental protections, safety requirements, or ethical obligations is prohibited.

Re-importation of goods or services produced through such bad-faith offshoring shall not receive legal protection, subsidy, or preferential treatment.

Corporate form, jurisdictional layering, or contractual indirection shall not shield such conduct from accountability.

⸻

Section 6. Protection of Ethical Domestic Enterprise

Enterprises that comply with constitutional labor, safety, environmental, and compensation standards shall not be disadvantaged in law or practice in favor of entities that externalize harm.

The economic structure of the Republic shall favor productive, ethical, and transparent enterprise over speculative, extractive, or deceptive models.

⸻

Section 7. Anti-Capture and Anti-Evasion Principle

No economic doctrine, regulatory structure, emergency justification, or efficiency rationale shall be used to evade or nullify the caps, ratios, prohibitions, or structural safeguards established in Article VIII.

Economic governance shall not be delegated, privatized, or obscured in a manner that defeats constitutional accountability.

Any mechanism that has the effect of systematically undermining Article VIII is void.

⸻

Section 8. Transparency of Economic Instruments

All public economic instruments, including debt instruments, guarantees, subsidies, and monetary mechanisms, shall be documented and preserved as public records.

Secrecy, complexity, or technical opacity shall not be used to conceal economic transfer, risk, or obligation from the People.

This Section operates in coordination with Article XXXIX.

⸻

Section 9. Structural Economic Harm as Public Injury

Where economic systems or policies reasonably foreseeable to produce widespread harm through concentration, distortion, or exploitation, such harm shall be treated as injury to the People collectively and to affected individuals individually.

Scale shall not diminish culpability or accountability.

⸻

Section 10. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to reinforce, not weaken, the economic discipline, ethical stewardship, and anti-capture structure established by Article VIII.

Where doubt exists, the construction that preserves the greatest force of Article VIII shall control.

⸻Article VIII-B — Prohibition of Predatory Economic Practices

Section 1. Non-Derogation and Relationship to Article VIII

This Article supplements Article VIII — Economic Structure and Stewardship.

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to narrow, dilute, suspend, or reinterpret the principles, prohibitions, caps, ratios, or safeguards established in Article VIII or Article VIII-A.

Where doubt exists, the construction that most restrains exploitation and protects human dignity shall control.

⸻

Section 2. Purpose

This Article prohibits economic practices that extract value through deception, coercion, structural asymmetry, or psychological manipulation, even where nominal consent is claimed.

Economic freedom does not include the freedom to prey upon dependency, ignorance, or desperation.

⸻

Section 3. Predatory Practices Defined

Predatory economic practices include, but are not limited to:
	1.	Deceptive Omission — withholding material risks, costs, exit barriers, failure rates, or adverse outcomes reasonably necessary for informed consent;
	2.	Coercive Sales Architecture — high-pressure tactics, artificial scarcity, time-limited inducements, emotional leverage, or social pressure impairing free choice;
	3.	Recruitment-Driven Compensation — compensation derived primarily from recruiting participants rather than from bona fide goods or services sold to end users;
	4.	Asymmetric Entry and Exit — arrangements facilitating easy entry while imposing disproportionate penalties, forfeitures, lock-ins, or barriers to exit;
	5.	Psychological Exploitation as a Business Model — systematic reliance on cognitive, emotional, or informational asymmetry to induce transactions adverse to participants.
6.  Highly leveraged acquisitions — Highly leveraged acquisitions that encumber an operating enterprise with debt exceeding a constitutionally reasonable proportion of acquisition value, where such debt materially impairs productive operation, worker compensation, or long-term viability, shall be presumptively predatory.

⸻

Section 4. Invalidity of Consent

Consent obtained through predatory economic practices is invalid as a matter of law, notwithstanding the absence of an express false statement.

Waivers, acknowledgments, or disclaimers shall not cure predation.

This Section regulates conduct and transactional architecture, not protected expression.

⸻

Section 5. Prohibited Schemes

Schemes commonly characterized as confidence operations, pyramid schemes, multi-level marketing arrangements, or functionally equivalent structures are prohibited where they satisfy Section 3, regardless of nomenclature or formal design.

Substance shall control over form.

⸻

Section 6. Mandatory Cooling-Off Period for High-Risk Transactions

For any transaction designated by law as high-risk, including but not limited to:
	•	timeshare interests;
	•	investment contracts marketed to non-professionals;
	•	advance-fee services;
	•	long-term lock-in agreements;
	•	recruitment-based compensation schemes;

a mandatory cooling-off period shall apply.
	1.	The cooling-off period shall be no less than seven (7) days from execution or payment, whichever occurs first.
	2.	During this period, the purchaser or participant may rescind for any reason or no reason, without penalty, forfeiture, or adverse consequence.
	3.	Any attempt to waive, shorten, obscure, or condition the cooling-off period is void.

⸻

Section 7. Bright-Line Presumptions

Transactions subject to Section 6 are presumptively predatory where:
	1.	material risks, costs, or failure rates are not disclosed prominently and in plain language;
	2.	compensation is primarily derived from recruitment rather than end-user value; or
	3.	exit requires forfeiture, penalty, or continued payment disproportionate to any bona fide service rendered.

Such presumptions may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence.

⸻

Section 8. Enforcement and Remedies

Violations of this Article are actionable through:
	•	civil enforcement;
	•	injunctive relief;
	•	restitution and disgorgement;
	•	dissolution of offending entities;
	•	prohibition on reconstitution under successor names or structures;
	•	criminal referral where warranted.

Arbitration clauses, choice-of-law provisions, forum selection clauses, or class-action waivers shall not bar enforcement.
Where an enterprise enters insolvency within a defined period following extraordinary distributions to executives or controlling investors, such distributions shall be subject to mandatory clawback.

⸻

Section 9. Escalation and Severity

Where predatory economic practices are willful, systematic, concealed, or result in widespread harm, such conduct constitutes parasitic wealth extraction and qualifies as a grave offense under Article 0.

Such conduct is eligible for Tier-3 classification pursuant to Article VII.

No property right shall vest in proceeds derived from predatory conduct.

⸻

Section 10. Interpretation

This Article regulates conduct, not protected expression.

It shall be construed broadly to prevent evasion through rebranding, contractual form, technological mediation, jurisdictional fragmentation, or legal indirection.

Where doubt exists, the construction that most protects human dignity and economic freedom shall control.

⸻Article VIII-C — Systemic Confidence Exploitation 
	1.	The Republic recognizes systemic confidence exploitation as a distinct and grave form of economic predation.
	2.	Systemic confidence exploitation consists of repeated or patterned conduct designed to extract value through deception, emotional manipulation, false identity, manufactured trust, or asymmetric disclosure, particularly where such conduct targets vulnerability, dependency, or isolation.
	3.	Such conduct constitutes an attack on economic freedom, human dignity, and public trust, regardless of formal consent or contractual appearance.
	4.	The Republic affirms a compelling public interest in the proactive detection, investigation, and disruption of systemic confidence exploitation, including through pattern-based inquiry not dependent on individual victim reporting, subject to probable cause or equivalent constitutional standard.
	5.	No contractual waiver, arbitration clause, jurisdictional indirection, or organizational restructuring shall immunize systemic confidence exploitation from investigation or enforcement.
	6.	The identification, investigation, and adjudication of such conduct shall proceed only through lawful process and evidentiary standards, with constitutional compliance review by the Constitutional Review Court.
	7.	This Article is declaratory and reservational.
It authorizes no punishment beyond that provided by law, but denies any presumption of legitimacy to enterprises or actors whose business model relies on confidence exploitation.

⸻

Article VIII-D — Economic Constitutional Enforcement Directorate
 Charge
Economic liberty cannot be preserved where constitutional prohibitions exist only on paper.
Predatory extraction, systemic exploitation, and oligarchic consolidation succeed not because they are lawful, but because they are complex, concealed, and under-enforced. Where enforcement is episodic, under-resourced, or politically dependent, constitutional economic safeguards decay into symbolism.
This Article establishes a narrow, judicially subordinated Economic Constitutional Enforcement Directorate to investigate, document, and prosecute violations of Articles VIII, VIII-A, VIII-B, and VIII-C, while denying it all authority to regulate, legislate, punish, negotiate, or define economic policy.
⸻
Section 1. Establishment and Judicial Subordination (Lock-Protected)
There is hereby established the Economic Constitutional Enforcement Directorate (“the Directorate”) as an investigative and prosecutorial arm solely subordinated to the Constitutional Judicial Commission (CJC).

Article IX — Land, Homesteading, and Agricultural Duty

Charge
This Article establishes constitutional rules governing land ownership, use, stewardship, and agricultural policy within the Republic. All provisions of this Article shall be construed to promote productive use, environmental stewardship, long-term sustainability, and broad access to land for lawful residence and cultivation. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to authorize land restriction, forfeiture, or redistribution except as expressly provided by law and subject to constitutional safeguards.

Legal Text

Section 1. Stewardship of Land

(a) Duty of Stewardship
The land, waters, soil, and natural systems of the Republic are held in sacred trust for the People and for future generations.
All land within the Republic shall be held subject to a duty of stewardship. Ownership of land confers not only rights, but obligations to use, maintain, and preserve land in a manner consistent with the long-term welfare of the People, the environment, and future generations.
Land is not a purely speculative instrument, nor an object of neglect; it is a public trust held in private hands. For purposes of this Article, beneficial ownership, control, coordination, or common management shall be aggregated, regardless of legal form or number of entities involved.
For purposes of stewardship, responsible land use may include the maintenance of forest health, soil stability, watershed protection, and reasonable mitigation of known ecological or fire risks, consistent with evidence and due process.
Stewardship shall have the meaning given in Article 0: the fiduciary duty of officials, landholders, and institutions to preserve and enhance these resources for long-term welfare, subject to enforcement as a constitutional obligation.
Neglect, waste, soil depletion, or predatory exploitation that materially weakens the Republic or future generations constitutes a grave offense (cross-reference Article 0; Article VII Tier Three offenses; Article I §9).
Stewardship obligations apply equally to individuals, corporations, trusts, religious bodies, and any coordinated ownership structure.
(b) Definition of Stewardship
Stewardship shall require that land be:
	•	maintained in safe, habitable, or productive condition appropriate to its zoning and designation;
	•	protected against intentional degradation, abandonment, or waste;
	•	free from prolonged neglect that creates public harm, blight, environmental damage, or artificial scarcity;
	•	used in good faith for habitation, agriculture, commerce, conservation, or public benefit.

Nominal, sham, or token use designed solely to evade stewardship obligations shall not satisfy this duty.

(c) Prohibited Conduct
The following constitute violations of stewardship:
	•	prolonged abandonment without just cause;
	•	deliberate deterioration or stripping of land or structures;
	•	hoarding land or housing to manipulate scarcity or price;
	•	allowing land to become hazardous, unsanitary, or ecologically destructive;
	•	maintaining property solely as a financial instrument without meaningful use;
	•	using shell entities or layered ownership to evade accountability.

Such conduct is contrary to the common good and subject to sanction.

(d) Enforcement Authority
Stewardship shall be enforced through a mixed model:
	•	local authorities shall conduct inspections, issue notices of violation, and document conditions;
	•	state authorities shall oversee enforcement standards, ensure uniformity, and prevent abuse or favoritism;
	•	all compulsory actions shall be subject to judicial review.

No land may be seized, reassigned, or repurposed without due process of law. Courts shall evaluate substance over form and material outcomes over nominal compliance.

(e) Notice and Opportunity to Cure
Before any compulsory action is taken, the owner shall receive:
	•	written notice of specific violations;
	•	a reasonable opportunity to cure or remediate;
	•	access to an impartial hearing;
	•	the right to present evidence and contest findings.

Emergency action may be taken only where immediate danger to life, health, or the environment exists, and must be reviewed by a court without delay.

(f) Remedies
Upon judicial finding of sustained stewardship violation, remedies may include:
	•	fines proportionate to harm and duration;
	•	mandatory remediation or use requirements;
	•	temporary receivership;
	•	transfer to homesteading, public trust, or community use as defined by law;
	•	forfeiture only in cases of willful, repeated, and egregious violation.

Receivership, temporary stewardship, compulsory leasing, or provisional homesteading shall not convey title or permanent ownership. Transfer or forfeiture of title may occur only upon a judicial finding of willful, repeated, and egregious violation of stewardship duties, following notice, opportunity to cure, proportional review, and written findings of fact and law.
Standing shall be construed broadly to include affected landholders, neighboring communities, downstream users, and civic organizations.
Punishment shall be corrective first, punitive only when correction is refused.

(g) Protection Against Abuse
Stewardship laws shall not be used to:
	•	dispossess productive smallholders;
	•	target owners based on political, ideological, or cultural grounds;
	•	enable corruption, favoritism, or retaliatory enforcement;
	•	concentrate land ownership in the State or corporate monopolies.

All enforcement actions must be transparent, reviewable, and grounded in demonstrable harm.
(h) Public Grazing and Commons Use.
The people retain the right to graze livestock and working animals on public lands traditionally or reasonably suitable for such use, provided such grazing is conducted in a non-destructive, non-hazardous, and ecologically responsible manner.

Such use shall not be conditioned upon discretionary permits, exclusive leases, or administrative approval regimes that function as barriers to access, favor large or centralized operators, or suppress subsistence, small-scale, or traditional use.

The government bears the burden of demonstrating, by clear and site-specific evidence, that a particular grazing practice, as conducted, causes material harm to public safety or the environment that cannot be mitigated by reasonable, narrowly tailored conditions.

Grazing rights shall not be extinguished, suspended, or reduced by generalized policy, speculative modeling, or economic preference, and shall be construed as a lawful use of the public commons consistent with stewardship obligations.
(i) Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to ensure that land serves life, family, production, and continuity—not speculation, decay, or absentee domination.

As Scripture teaches: “Moreover, it is required in stewards that one be found faithful.”

Section 2. Homesteading Rights

(a) Purpose
The purpose of homesteading is to restore productive use of neglected land, expand access to housing and agriculture, strengthen families, and prevent permanent hoarding or decay. Homesteading is a civic instrument of renewal, not a loophole for speculation or seizure.

(b) Eligibility
Only Civic Citizens of the Republic may initiate a homesteading claim. “Civic Citizen” has the meaning set forth in Article III. Legal residents may participate only as dependents, partners, or laborers under a qualified Civic Citizen.

No corporation, trust, shell entity, or foreign-controlled body may initiate a homesteading claim.

(c) Eligible Land
Land eligible for homesteading shall be limited to parcels that meet all of the following conditions:
	•	demonstrably unused, abandoned, or neglected for a continuous period defined by law;
	•	not actively farmed, inhabited, or maintained in good faith;
	•	not subject to active remediation or lawful development;
	•	not held for essential public, military, ecological, or cultural purposes;
	•	not the primary residence of any lawful owner.

Farmland, housing stock, and mixed-use land may qualify only upon judicial certification of abandonment or non-productive hoarding.

(d) Petition and Review
Homesteading shall proceed only by formal petition filed with the appropriate local authority and reviewed by a Stewardship Court or designated judicial body.

(e) Provisional Stewardship Period
If approved, the petitioner shall be granted provisional stewardship for a fixed term not less than three years.

(f) Final Vesting
Upon successful completion of the provisional period and certification by the Stewardship Court, title shall vest fully in the homesteader, subject to continuing stewardship obligations.

(g) Civic Contribution
Responsible agricultural labor, soil stewardship, and family-scale food production may qualify as equivalent public service toward earning Civic Citizenship, subject to objective verification and the standards of Article III and Article XVIII.

Section 3. Anti-Speculative Ownership
(a) Purpose
The purpose of this Section is to prevent land and housing from being treated as purely speculative instruments divorced from use, stewardship, and human settlement.

(b) Definition of Speculative Ownership
Speculative ownership shall be defined as the acquisition or retention of land or housing primarily for price manipulation, artificial scarcity, passive appreciation without productive use, or rent extraction absent maintenance or improvement.

(c) Ownership Transparency
All land ownership shall be transparent. Beneficial ownership must be publicly disclosed. Anonymous or nominee ownership is prohibited. Failure to disclose constitutes grounds for forfeiture.
Any attempt to circumvent these limits through proxies, trusts, shell companies, or pretextual coercion (as defined in Article 0) is void ab initio.
(d) Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to ensure that land serves families, workers, farmers, and communities before financiers and absentee interests.

Section 4. Agricultural Protection

(a) Purpose
Agriculture is a matter of national survival, not merely commerce. The Republic affirms that food security and domestic agricultural independence are essential to sovereignty.

(b) Preservation of Farmland
Farmland shall be preserved primarily for food production. Conversion to non-agricultural use shall be restricted and subject to transparent approval.

(c) Foreign Ownership
Foreign governments, foreign-controlled entities, and large corporations (as defined in Article XVII) shall be strictly limited in their ownership or control of agricultural land, water rights, and primary natural resources.
Such ownership or control shall be:
1. capped at a maximum percentage of total arable land per entity, as determined by statute;
2. subject to revocation if it results in land-hoarding, monoculture that degrades soil health, environmental harm, suppression of family farming, or demographic engineering (cross-reference Article 0 definitions of Demographic Engineering and Corporation);
3. prohibited outright for entities whose beneficial ownership includes substantial foreign state or adversarial interests.
Any attempt to circumvent these limits through proxies, trusts, shell companies, or pretextual coercion (as defined in Article 0) is void ab initio.
(d) Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to preserve farming as a living vocation, not a financial abstraction.

Section 5. Food Integrity and Ecological Protection

(a) Prohibition of Food Cartels
Food cartels, price-fixing, and supply manipulation are prohibited.

(b) Prohibition of Poisonous Practices
It is unlawful to introduce substances into soil, air, or water that degrade long-term fertility or habitability.

(c) Evidentiary Standard
No plant or substance may be prohibited without clear and convincing scientific evidence of substantial harm, subject to transparent public review, adversarial testing, and periodic renewal. Criminal penalties arising from such prohibitions shall require proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

(d) Third-Tier Crimes
Knowingly poisoning land, water, air, or food systems constitutes a third-tier crime as defined in Article VII.

Section 6. Ecological Responsibility

(a) Duty of Care
All persons and entities have a duty to avoid reckless or irreversible ecological harm.

(b) Scientific Standard
Environmental restrictions shall be based on reproducible scientific evidence and periodic review.
(c) Scientific Uncertainty
Where scientific uncertainty exists, the presumption shall favor liberty, property rights, and productive use unless clear and convincing evidence demonstrates imminent and specific harm.
(d) Interpretation
Environmental protection shall serve life and stewardship, not ideology or control.

Section 7. Native and Ancestral Stewardship

(a) Purpose
The Republic recognizes Indigenous and ancestral ties to land while maintaining one Constitution and one rule of law.

(b) Status
Indigenous communities are local civic entities subject to this Constitution.

(c) Interpretation
Heritage shall be preserved without fragmenting sovereignty.

Section 8. Religious and Communal Stewardship of Land

(a) Equal Application of Law
Religious and communal land holdings are subject to the same law and stewardship obligations as all others.

(b) Prohibited Uses
Land may not be used under religious pretext to conceal abuse, trafficking, or coercion.

(c) Interpretation
Faith does not excuse atrocity.

Section 9. Voluntary Communities and Cooperative Living

(a) Right of Formation
Voluntary communities may form, subject to the Constitution and laws of the Republic.

(b) Prohibition of Coercion
No community may restrict lawful exit or impose coercion.

(c) Interpretation
Community is a liberty, not a license.

Section 10. Housing Stability Mandate

(a) Purpose
Habitable housing shall not be artificially withheld from use amid demonstrable need.

(b) Due Process
No housing may be seized or repurposed without notice, opportunity to cure, judicial findings, and proportional remedy.

(c) Interpretation
Housing shall serve human dignity and continuity.
Section 11. Anti-Predatory Recycling and Material Reuse

(a) Material Stewardship Principle
All physical goods, machinery, electronics, and industrial artifacts embody labor, knowledge, and public value. Destruction of functional or repairable goods for market control, profit maximization, or artificial scarcity is a form of economic and environmental harm.

⸻

(b) Reuse Before Recycle

No recycler, manufacturer, disposal contractor, or waste intermediary may shred, export, or materially destroy any functional or repairable device, tool, or machine unless:
	1.	it has been offered for reuse, repair, or resale;
	2.	it has been offered to public institutions, schools, or charitable technology programs; and
	3.	it has been offered to preservation, repair, or historical organizations.

Only goods that are unsafe, irreparably damaged, or beyond reasonable economic repair may be processed for raw material recovery.

⸻

(c) Prohibition on Market-Suppressive Destruction

Destruction of usable goods for the purpose of:

• eliminating secondary markets;
• forcing consumer repurchase;
• maintaining vendor lock-in;
• suppressing competition;
• or controlling access to technology

is prohibited and constitutes economic sabotage and environmental fraud.

⸻

(d) Electronics, Machinery, and Digital Infrastructure

All electronic, computing, networking, industrial, and scientific equipment is subject to this Section.

This includes computers, servers, phones, routers, vehicles, medical devices, laboratory instruments, and manufacturing systems.

⸻

(e) Enforcement and Integration

Violations are enforceable by:

• environmental authorities;
• inspectors general;
• the Digital Commons Enforcement Authority;
• and any citizen with standing.

Remedies include seizure, redistribution, public auction, restitution, loss of contracts, and criminal penalties where willful.

Section 12. Article IX — Definitions and Construction
	•	Beneficial ownership, control, coordination, or common management shall be aggregated, regardless of legal form or number of entities.
	•	Courts shall evaluate substance over form and material outcomes over nominal compliance.
	•	Organization includes corporations, nonprofits, trusts, foundations, religious entities, cooperatives, associations, and any coordinated body of persons acting in concert.
	•	Coercion includes psychological, economic, social, spiritual, or immigration-based pressure.
	•	No emergency declaration may override due process, stewardship requirements, or judicial review guaranteed herein.
	•	Foreign funding, direction, or coordination related to land, agriculture, ecology, or food systems must be publicly disclosed.
	•	Rules of constitutional interpretation applicable to this Article are governed by Article XIX.
	•	This Article supplements Article VIII. Where provisions overlap, the stricter stewardship, anti-monopoly, or anti-abuse rule shall govern unless explicitly stated otherwise.
Section 13. Lock Designation

Pursuant to Article XV, this Article is hereby designated as LOCK-PROTECTED. No amendment, statute, executive action, judicial doctrine, or emergency declaration may dilute, suspend, reinterpret, or circumvent the stewardship obligations, anti-speculation provisions, homesteading rights, agricultural protections, or evidentiary standards herein except through the highest procedural threshold and certification of non-diminishment.


Article IX-A — Indigenous and Tribal Corporate Land-Use Rights, Stewardship, and Non-Exclusion

Charge
This Article secures lawful Indigenous and tribal corporate land-use rights— including fishing, hunting, grazing, and farming— as instruments of heritage preservation, livelihood continuity, and local resilience, while enforcing one Constitution, one rule of law, and uniform civil rights for all lawful residents.
These protections shall not create caste, hereditary political privilege, dual citizenship, territorial apartheid, or exclusionary sovereignty. Rights herein operate through ordinary property, easement, stewardship, and environmental law, with strict due process and anti-capture safeguards.
(Cross-references: Article II; Article III; Article III-B; Article IX; Article 0; Article XV.)

Section 1. Definitions and Scope

(a) Tribal Corporate Entity.
“Tribal Corporate Entity” means an Indigenous nation, tribe, or recognized people organized as a corporate entity under national corporate law, as recognized and permitted under Article III-B.

(b) Covered Uses.
“Covered Uses” means: subsistence and customary fishing, hunting, grazing, farming, gathering, and related land-management practices, including seasonal and ceremonial uses where consistent with public safety and stewardship.

(c) Covered Lands.
“Covered Lands” means:
(1) Tribal corporate lands held in fee, corporate title, trust-converted title, or other lawful corporate ownership form recognized under Article III-B and national property law; and
(2) Designated co-managed public lands subject to Section 3 of this Article.

(d) No Political Authority by Land-Use Right.
No land-use right recognized herein confers political authority, suffrage, office eligibility, or Civic Standing. Political authority is governed exclusively by Article III.

(e) Uniform Civil Rights.
All lawful residents retain equal civil rights under Article II. Nothing herein shall diminish civil rights, equal protection, due process, or access to courts.

Section 2. Tribal Corporate Land-Use Rights on Tribal Corporate Lands

(a) Baseline Rights.
On tribal corporate lands, Tribal Corporate Entities and their lawful beneficiaries may:
(1) fish, hunt, graze, and farm for subsistence, commerce, cultural continuity, or stewardship purposes;
(2) regulate ordinary access as a property holder may, consistent with Article II and Section 6 of this Article; and
(3) implement internal land-use rules that are viewpoint-neutral, non-discriminatory as to civil rights, and consistent with this Constitution.

(b) Public Safety and General Law.
Covered Uses remain subject to general criminal law, public safety law, and conservation law applicable to all persons, provided such law is:
(1) generally applicable and non-discriminatory;
(2) based on clear, site-specific evidence where it restricts customary practice;
(3) narrowly tailored to prevent imminent and specific harm; and
(4) subject to judicial review with due process.

(c) Stewardship Obligations.
Tribal corporate lands are subject to the same duty of stewardship as all lands under Article IX, including prohibitions on neglect, waste, soil depletion, and predatory exploitation, and the same protections against abusive enforcement.
Stewardship enforcement must respect Article II due process and takings protections.

Section 3. Co-Managed Public Lands and Priority-Use Framework

(a) Designation by Law; No Blanket Carve-Outs.
Law may designate specific public lands, waters, or ranges as co-managed areas where covered Indigenous customary use historically occurred, provided designation:
(1) is site-specific and publicly mapped;
(2) includes written findings of historic nexus and practical necessity;
(3) preserves one Constitution and one judiciary; and
(4) does not create exclusive sovereign territory.

(b) Priority Use Without Exclusion.
Within designated co-managed areas, law may grant Tribal Corporate Entities and their lawful beneficiaries a priority-use framework for Covered Uses, meaning:
(1) priority seasonal windows;
(2) priority allotments within sustainable limits; and/or
(3) priority access to permits where a permit system is constitutionally valid.
Priority use shall not constitute blanket exclusion of other lawful residents unless exclusion is necessary to prevent imminent and specific harm and is ordered by a court using the least restrictive means.

(c) Non-Discrimination and Equal Baseline Access.
All lawful residents may access public lands under general law. Priority-use frameworks must:
(1) remain viewpoint-neutral and not function as demographic engineering;
(2) preserve baseline access for non-tribal persons subject to stewardship;
(3) prohibit exclusive monopolization of public resources; and
(4) remain reviewable and adjustable to avoid ecological harm.

(d) Conservation Standard.
No restriction on general public access, and no allocation of exclusive priority beyond narrow windows or allotments, shall occur absent clear and convincing evidence that the restriction is necessary to prevent imminent and specific harm that cannot be mitigated by narrower means.

Section 4. Grazing and Range Rights Integration

(a) Harmonization with Article IX.
Where Article IX recognizes public grazing and commons use, Tribal Corporate Entities may participate in that commons under the same anti-capture principles and stewardship standards, and may also receive limited priority-use within co-managed areas under Section 3.

(b) No Exclusive Leasing Regime.
No priority-use framework may be implemented through discretionary permits or exclusive leases that function as barriers to access, entrench incumbent power, or suppress small-scale subsistence use, whether tribal or non-tribal.

(c) Evidence-Based Limits.
Where grazing practice causes material harm, the government bears the burden of demonstrating, by clear and site-specific evidence, that harm cannot be mitigated by reasonable, narrowly tailored conditions.

Section 5. Farming, Gathering, and Stewardship Easements

(a) Productive Use Encouraged.
Tribal Corporate Entities may farm, gather, and cultivate in ways consistent with long-term soil and watershed health, consistent with Article IX stewardship standards.

(b) Stewardship Easements.
Law may recognize stewardship easements on tribal corporate lands and co-managed areas to protect archeological sites, sacred sites, watershed corridors, wildlife corridors, and soil health, provided easements:
(1) are specific and recorded;
(2) impose the least restrictive means;
(3) include notice and opportunity to contest; and
(4) allow reasonable traditional use consistent with protection.

(c) Reciprocal Access Corridors.
Where feasible and safe, law should favor reciprocal access corridors (trails, right-of-way, waterways passage) that preserve general movement and continuity without forcing entry into culturally sensitive sites.

Section 6. Non-Exclusion, Anti-Caste, and Civil Rights Safeguards

(a) No Racial or Blood-Quantum Caste.
No law, policy, or corporate rule may create a racially segregated paradise, caste hierarchy, or hereditary civil-rights class. Civil rights remain uniform under Article II.

(b) Access Control Limited to Property and Cultural Sensitivity.
Tribal Corporate Entities may restrict entry to tribal corporate lands for the same reasons other private owners may, including prevention of crime and protection of sensitive rituals, sacred sites, or internal corporate meetings, provided restrictions:
(1) do not deny emergency access, lawful warrants, or due process;
(2) do not operate as public-accommodation discrimination where public accommodation law constitutionally applies; and
(3) do not convert public lands into exclusionary territory.

(c) No Dual Citizenship; No Separate Sovereignty.
Nothing in this Article creates dual citizenship, independent criminal or civil jurisdiction, or exemption from constitutional law, consistent with Article III-B.

(d) No Political Exclusion.
No priority-use framework under this Article may be conditioned on political belief, party affiliation, ideology, compelled speech, or compelled cultural assent.

(e) No Independent Police Power.
Nothing in this Article or in any tribal corporate charter shall be construed to grant any independent police power, power of arrest, detention authority, or criminal jurisdiction to any tribal entity or tribal corporate entity.
Trespass and other violations shall be addressed through ordinary civil remedies and through the constitutional judiciary and Republic law enforcement under general law, with full due process.
Private security may observe, document, and request departure, and may use only the same narrowly limited defensive force available to any private person under general law.
(f) Local Law Enforcement Permitted; Uniform Judiciary Required.
Nothing in this Article prohibits the formation of ordinary municipal, county, or state law-enforcement agencies that may be locally staffed, including predominantly by members of a tribe, provided such agencies operate under the unified constitutional criminal code, procedure, and judiciary of the Republic.
No law-enforcement body may claim separate sovereign criminal jurisdiction or submit cases to a parallel court system.

Section 7. Recordation, Transparency, and Anti-Predation

(a) Recordation of Designations and Rights.
All co-managed designations, priority windows, allotments, stewardship easements, and access corridors must be publicly recorded and mapped, with narrowly tailored redaction only for protection of sensitive archeological and sacred site locations.

(b) Anti-Predatory Encumbrance.
No contract, lease, bond, derivative, concession, management agreement, or financial instrument may encumber tribal land-use rights or co-managed priority rights in a manner that transfers effective control to non-tribal parties, extracts profit streams without fair market compensation, or engineers default to seize assets. Such instruments are void.

(c) Beneficiary Protection.
Where revenues or resource benefits flow from covered uses, governance shall operate for the benefit of lawful beneficiaries, with judicially auditable records sufficient to detect private enrichment or diversion.

Section 8. Enforcement and Remedies

(a) Standing.
Standing shall be construed broadly to include Tribal Corporate Entities, lawful beneficiaries, neighboring communities, downstream users, and civic organizations where demonstrable harm exists, consistent with Article IX.

(b) Judicial Forum and Due Process.
All disputes under this Article are subject to the constitutional judiciary. No separate or parallel court system is created. Injunctions, damages, restitution, and takings remedies remain available under Article II.

(c) Strict Scrutiny of Discriminatory Targeting.
Discriminatory taxation, special fees, licensing schemes, zoning, or indirect economic strangulation targeting tribal corporate covered uses are prohibited and shall be treated as unconstitutional takings and equal-protection violations, requiring full restitution and damages.

Section 9. Construction

(a) Against Exclusionary Sovereignty.
Ambiguities shall be resolved against the creation of caste, territorial apartheid, dual citizenship, or exclusionary sovereignty.

(b) In Favor of Stewardship and Equal Civil Rights.
Ambiguities shall be resolved in favor of stewardship, ecological responsibility, and equal civil rights under Article II, while preserving the practical ability of Indigenous communities to maintain customary covered uses and cultural continuity.

Section 10. Lock Designation

Pursuant to Article XV, this Article is designated as LOCK-PROTECTED.
No amendment, statute, executive action, judicial doctrine, or emergency declaration may dilute, suspend, reinterpret, or circumvent the non-exclusion safeguards, stewardship requirements, or due-process protections herein except through the highest procedural threshold and certification of non-diminishment.
