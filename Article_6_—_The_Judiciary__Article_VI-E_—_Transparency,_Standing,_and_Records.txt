Article VI-E — Transparency, Standing, and Records

Section 1. Presumption of Judicial Openness

Judicial proceedings, opinions, orders, filings, and records shall be presumed open to the public.

The Judiciary is bound by the same constitutional presumption of openness that governs all branches of the Republic under Article XXXIX.

Secrecy in judicial proceedings is the exception, not the rule, and shall be permitted only as expressly authorized by this Constitution.

⸻

Section 2. Public Proceedings and Opinions

All judicial proceedings shall be open to the public, except where limited closure is necessary to prevent substantial, specific, and foreseeable harm to a constitutionally protected interest.

All final opinions, judgments, and orders shall be published promptly and in full.

No court shall issue secret law, unpublished binding precedent, or concealed interpretations of this Constitution.

⸻

Section 3. Standing to Enforce Transparency

Any person shall have standing to challenge:
	1.	unlawful sealing or withholding of judicial records;
	2.	improper closure of judicial proceedings;
	3.	destruction, alteration, or concealment of judicial records;
	4.	violations of transparency obligations imposed by this Constitution.

Standing under this Section shall be construed liberally and independently of injury requirements applicable to other claims.

⸻

Section 4. Narrow and Time-Limited Sealing

Judicial records or proceedings may be sealed only upon a written finding, supported by clear and convincing evidence, that:
	1.	disclosure would cause substantial and specific harm to a constitutionally protected interest; and
	2.	no less restrictive alternative is available.

All sealing orders shall:
	1.	be narrowly tailored;
	2.	specify their scope and duration;
	3.	expire automatically unless renewed upon fresh findings meeting the same constitutional standard.

Indefinite or permanent sealing is prohibited.

⸻

Section 5. Record Preservation and Archiving

All judicial records, including filings, evidence admitted into the record, opinions, orders, transcripts, and metadata, shall be preserved as public records held in trust for the People.

Judicial records shall be archived in coordination with the Public Ministry of Records established under Article XXXIX.

No judicial officer or court shall maintain off-book, undisclosed, or inaccessible record systems.

⸻

Section 6. Prohibition on Destruction or Retroactive Secrecy

No judicial record shall be destroyed, altered, sealed, or retroactively classified for the purpose of evading accountability, review, or public access.

Destruction of judicial records may occur only pursuant to lawful retention schedules or judicial orders consistent with Article XXXIX.

Intentional destruction, concealment, or falsification of judicial records constitutes a grave constitutional violation.

⸻

Section 7. Transparency of Judicial Discipline

Proceedings, findings, and sanctions of the Judicial Review Board shall be public, except where limited confidentiality is necessary to protect complainants or due process.

Final disciplinary outcomes shall be published and permanently archived.

⸻

Section 8. Access, Costs, and Non-Obstruction

Access to judicial records shall be timely and meaningful.

Fees shall not be imposed except to recover reasonable and actual duplication costs and shall not be used to deter or delay access.

Administrative burden, embarrassment, reputational harm to officials, or institutional convenience shall not justify denial or delay.

⸻

Section 9. Relationship to Article XXXIX

This Subarticle shall be read in full harmony with Article XXXIX.

Where a conflict is alleged, the construction favoring greater transparency, access, and preservation shall control.

The Judiciary shall not claim exemption from Article XXXIX except where this Constitution expressly provides otherwise.

⸻

Section 10. Remedies and Accountability

Courts shall provide expedited review of transparency claims.

Judicial officers and court personnel who intentionally obstruct access, destroy records, or violate this Subarticle shall be subject to discipline, removal, and personal liability as provided by law.

No immunity shall attach to intentional violations of transparency obligations.

⸻

Section 11. Interpretation

This Subarticle shall be interpreted to ensure that the Judiciary does not govern in darkness, that constitutional adjudication remains publicly knowable, and that the memory of the Republic is preserved intact for present and future generations.
