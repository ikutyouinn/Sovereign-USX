Article Article XXVIII-A — State Nullification and Federalism Safeguards

Section 1 — Right of State Interposition

(a) Each State reserves the sovereign right to interpose and nullify any federal or national law, regulation, mandate, or executive action that exceeds the enumerated powers expressly delegated to the federal government by this Constitution, or that is not strictly necessary and proper for their execution.

(b) State interposition is a constitutional safeguard of federalism and shall operate as a lawful defense against overreach, consolidation, or abuse of centralized authority.

Section 2 — Criteria for Nullification

Nullification may be invoked where a federal action:

(a) burdens State sovereignty, individual liberties, or local economies without clear constitutional authorization;

(b) imposes speculative, novel, or disproportionate requirements lacking demonstrated, non-speculative harm, including but not limited to mandates premised upon conjectural environmental, economic, or public-welfare claims;

(c) results from interstate imbalance, including policies driven primarily by populous or economically dominant States that coerce, externalize costs upon, or structurally disadvantage less-populous States through federal mechanisms.

⸻

Section 3 — Process and Thresholds

(a) Nullification may be initiated by:
	1.	a majority vote of the State legislature; or
	2.	a citizen petition bearing verified digital signatures from not less than ten percent (10%) of registered voters of the State, utilizing secure, auditable systems sufficient to prevent fraud and ensure integrity.

(b) Upon initiation, nullification shall require approval by a sixty percent (60%) supermajority in a statewide popular referendum, conducted within one hundred eighty (180) days of initiation.

(c) Upon approval, the challenged federal action shall be null and unenforceable within the State pending judicial resolution.

(d) The federal government bears the burden to prove, by clear and convincing evidence in the Constitutional Review Court, that the challenged action is constitutionally required, narrowly tailored, and not pretextual. Generalized invocations of interstate commerce, environmental necessity, or public welfare shall not suffice absent individualized, non-speculative harm.

(e) Nullifications shall sunset after ten (10) years unless renewed through the same process. Upon renewal, the nullification shall become permanent within that State and shall not require a constitutional amendment.

⸻

Section 4 — Anti-Coercion and Anti-Bullying Protections

(a) No federal funding, grant, subsidy, incentive, or assistance shall be conditioned upon compliance with a nullified action, nor withheld or reduced as retaliation for lawful nullification.

(b) States may form compacts for mutual defense against federal overreach, provided such compacts respect equal State sovereignty and do not infringe powers expressly reserved to the federal government, including treaty-making and national defense.

(c) Federal actions that disproportionately benefit or burden States based upon population size, economic dominance, or political influence are presumptively invalid unless justified by demonstrable, direct, cross-border necessity.

The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to investigate and certify whether federal agencies, courts, or political actors are engaging in financial coercion, regulatory retaliation, or institutional pressure to defeat lawful nullification, and may petition the Constitutional Review Court for injunctive or structural relief.

⸻

Section 5 — Limits and Construction

(a) Nullification shall not apply to federal powers expressly enumerated in this Constitution where genuine, direct, and material cross-border effects are proven.

(b) No State may nullify the same federal action more than once within a ten-year period absent materially new evidence of harm.

(c) This Article shall be construed broadly in favor of State sovereignty and federalism, narrowly against centralization, and to prevent the federal government from becoming an instrument of interstate domination, administrative coercion, or arbitrary mandate.

(d) Knowing violations of this Article by federal officials constitute breaches of public trust and are impeachable offenses.
