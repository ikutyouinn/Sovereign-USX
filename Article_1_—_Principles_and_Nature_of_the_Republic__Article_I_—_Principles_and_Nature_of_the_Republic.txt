Article I — Principles and Nature of the Republic

Charge

The Republic is founded upon the inherent dignity, equal worth, and natural rights of all persons, which exist prior to and above government.

Government is created not to grant rights, but to recognize, protect, and secure them through law, restraint, and accountable power.

This Constitution establishes a Republic of ordered liberty, in which freedom is preserved by law, power is bounded by duty, and public authority exists solely to serve the People.

Civic authority is not inherited, purchased, or seized, but earned through lawful participation, service, and allegiance to constitutional order.

No office, institution, or majority may lawfully override the supremacy of this Constitution, the sovereignty of the People, or the inviolable rights it protects.

This Article sets forth the foundational structure of the Republic: the nature of sovereignty, the limits of power, the distinction between civil and political status, and the duties of stewardship and vigilance that bind all who govern.
Legal Text

Section 1. Nature of the Republic

The Republic is a constitutional, rights-bounded system of ordered liberty grounded in justice, responsibility, and stewardship.

Government exists solely to:
(a) recognize, protect, and secure the natural and civil rights of the People;
(b) uphold equal justice under law;
(c) provide public goods that cannot be effectively supplied by individuals or markets; and
(d) preserve the constitutional order.

Ordered liberty means liberty exercised under law, bounded by the equal rights of others, and constrained by duties of citizenship and public trust — not license, coercion, or arbitrary power.

No authority may redefine “justice,” “evidence,” “morality,” or “public good” to negate, diminish, or subordinate the rights secured by this Constitution.

Section 2. Supremacy of the Constitution

This Constitution is the supreme law of the Republic and binds all branches, officers, agencies, courts, subdivisions, and instrumentalities of government.

Any statute, treaty, decree, regulation, ordinance, executive action, judicial doctrine, or administrative practice inconsistent with this Constitution is void and without legal force.

No emergency, necessity, international obligation, or claimed sovereign immunity shall excuse noncompliance.

All public officials owe primary allegiance to this Constitution and are personally accountable for acts taken in violation of it.

Section 3. Separation of Powers

The Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches are separate, coequal, and bound by this Constitution.

Each branch shall exercise only the powers expressly granted to it, and no branch may exercise, delegate, assume, or conceal the powers of another.

Coequality means no branch is subordinate to another in constitutional authority, but all are subordinate to the Constitution and the People.

No branch may evade accountability through:
• delegation to unaccountable bodies,
• reclassification of powers,
• emergency doctrine,
• judicial or administrative invention, or
• procedural obstruction.

All branches remain continuously accountable to the People and to constitutional review.

Section 4. Moral and Civilizational Foundation

The Republic affirms that liberty cannot be sustained without respect for human dignity, historical continuity, and ethical restraint.

This Constitution is informed by the accumulated moral, legal, and philosophical traditions of human civilization, including principles of justice, mercy, truth, accountability, and stewardship.

Moral principles may guide law, but no moral, religious, cultural, or ideological doctrine shall be imposed by the state as a condition of legal status, civil rights, or political participation.

No religion, creed, philosophy, or belief system shall be established, endorsed, or enforced by government, nor shall belief or conscience be coerced.

No provision of this Section shall be construed to authorize:
(a) establishment of religion;
(b) preference for one faith, culture, or worldview over another;
(c) civil hierarchy based on belief; or
(d) coercion of conscience or identity.

Courts shall construe this Section to preserve moral grounding without permitting theocracy, ideological enforcement, or cultural supremacy.

Section 5. Civic Status and Non-Civic Citizens

Non-civic citizens include:
(a) persons born within the territory of the Republic;
(b) persons born abroad to citizens of the Republic; and
(c) all persons lawfully admitted for permanent residence.

All non-civic citizens retain the full and equal protection of the Constitution, including all rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights, such as freedom of speech, religion, conscience, movement, enterprise, property, due process, and access to the courts.
(cross-reference Article II; Article 0)

Non-civic citizens may participate fully in civil society, culture, education, labor, association, and public discourse.

Political authority — including the right to vote, hold public office, or exercise control over government institutions — shall be exercised only by Civic Citizens who have satisfied the service, qualification, and loyalty requirements of Article III.

Civic status is a qualification for governance, not a classification of human worth. No civil right, legal protection, or human dignity shall depend upon civic status.

No person shall be deprived of civil rights, property, liberty, or legal standing on the basis of non-civic status, nor may any authority redefine or manipulate civic classifications to evade constitutional protections.

Section 6. Rights of Unlawful Entrants

Persons who enter or reside unlawfully retain the right to:
(a) due process of law;
(b) freedom from violence, coercion, and abuse;
(c) humane treatment; and
(d) Good Samaritan aid necessary to preserve life and dignity.

Unlawful entrants shall not possess political rights, shall not be counted for purposes of representation or apportionment, and shall not acquire lawful status or civic standing through executive, administrative, or political discretion alone.

Any grant, denial, or regularization of status shall occur only through procedures established by law, subject to judicial review and consistent with this Constitution.

Section 7. Mechanisms of Rectification

A lawful and limited pathway of rectification may exist for:
(a) persons brought into the Republic as minors through no fault of their own; or
(b) persons who demonstrate exceptional, verifiable contributions to the public welfare, national security, or civic life of the Republic.

Rectification shall be:
(a) administered by independent, non-partisan bodies;
(b) governed by objective, transparent, and measurable criteria;
(c) subject to judicial review; and
(d) limited in scale so as not to permit demographic engineering, political manipulation, or mass regularization.

No individual, class, or group shall obtain lawful status, residency, or civic standing through discretionary amnesty, executive action, or political bargaining.

Section 8. Condemnation of Corruption and Oathbreaking

Oathbreaking, corruption, fraud, and abuse of public office constitute grave offenses against the Republic and the People.

Public office is a fiduciary trust. Every officer owes a duty of loyalty, honesty, and lawful service to the Constitution and to the People.

Any official who:
(a) knowingly violates the Constitution;
(b) uses office for private gain;
(c) abuses authority;
(d) betrays public trust; or
(e) participates in institutional capture
shall be subject to removal, disqualification, civil liability, and criminal prosecution as provided by law.

No oath, immunity, rank, or position shall shield any person from accountability for betrayal of public trust.

Section 9. Duty of Stewardship

All citizens and all holders of public office owe a constitutional duty of stewardship over land, resources, institutions, and the public trust.

Stewardship means the fiduciary obligation to preserve, maintain, and improve the long-term welfare, resilience, and continuity of the Republic for present and future generations.
(as defined in Article 0)

Neglect, waste, looting, short-term exploitation, or predatory conduct that materially weakens the Republic, degrades its resources, or undermines its institutions constitutes a breach of constitutional duty.

Breach of stewardship is enforceable through civil liability, forfeiture, disqualification from office, and criminal sanction as provided by law.

Section 10. Eternal Vigilance

(a) Principle

Liberty and constitutional integrity require continuous vigilance. Tyranny, corruption, and decay must be actively opposed and shall not be permitted to arise through silence, fear, or institutional drift.

(b) Right

The People retain the right to peaceably oppose, expose, criticize, investigate, and lawfully resist:
• constitutional violations;
• corruption;
• unlawful authority; and
• abuse of public power.

(c) Protection

No person shall be punished, harassed, censored, surveilled, deprived of rights, or subjected to retaliation for lawful civic protest, whistleblowing, journalism, oversight, or public criticism undertaken in defense of constitutional order.

(d) Civic Duty

All citizens, and especially all holders of public office, have a duty to defend this Constitution, report violations, refuse unlawful orders, and oppose institutional capture, even when such defense is unpopular or dangerous.

Section 11. Lock Designation

Civic vigilance, lawful oversight, and informed engagement by the People are essential to the health and survival of the Republic.

The core principles of this Article — including:
• ordered liberty;
• moral and civilizational grounding;
• the supremacy of the Constitution;
• separation of powers;
• the duty of stewardship; and
• the distinction between Civic and non-civic citizens —
are structural to this Constitution and shall not be repealed, suspended, diluted, or reinterpreted to undermine liberty, accountability, or popular sovereignty.

These principles may be amended only through the lock-protected procedures of Article XV and only in a manner that preserves, and does not diminish, their substantive force.

No statute, regulation, executive action, treaty, or judicial doctrine may evade or weaken this Lock.
