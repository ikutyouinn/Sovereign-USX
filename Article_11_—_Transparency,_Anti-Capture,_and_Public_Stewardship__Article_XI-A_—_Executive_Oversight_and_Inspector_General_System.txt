Article XI-A — Executive Oversight and Inspector General System

Section 1. Non-Derogation and Subordination

This Article supplements Article XI — Transparency, Anti-Capture, and Public Stewardship.

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to narrow, delay, condition, substitute for, or exhaust the duties, liabilities, prohibitions, or remedies imposed by Article XI.

Compliance with oversight mechanisms established herein shall not constitute a defense to violation of Article XI.

⸻

Section 2. Establishment of the Inspector General System

An independent Inspector General System (IGS) is hereby established to investigate, audit, and expose violations of Article XI and related constitutional provisions.

The IGS exists to detect, document, and refer, not to replace constitutional accountability.

⸻

Section 3. Independence and Structural Insulation

Inspectors General shall be independent of the entities they oversee.

They shall not be subject to direction, suppression, or prior approval by:
	1.	the Executive;
	2.	any department or agency;
	3.	intelligence or security services;
	4.	regulated entities or contractors.

Budgetary, personnel, and operational independence shall be guaranteed by law.

⸻

Section 4. Appointment and Term

Inspectors General shall be appointed through a multi-branch process designed to prevent capture, as provided by law.

Terms shall be fixed, staggered, and sufficiently long to ensure independence.

No Inspector General may be removed except for cause, upon documented findings, and subject to judicial review.

⸻

Section 5. Jurisdiction and Scope

Inspectors General shall have jurisdiction over:
	1.	executive agencies and officers;
	2.	public contractors and grantees;
	3.	quasi-public entities exercising public authority;
	4.	intelligence, surveillance, and security programs;
	5.	public-private partnerships affecting public power or funds.

Jurisdiction shall extend to records, algorithms, technical systems, financial flows, and decision-making processes.

⸻

Section 6. Investigative Authority

Inspectors General may:
	1.	compel production of documents and records;
	2.	subpoena testimony;
	3.	audit financial and technical systems;
	4.	inspect algorithms, models, and decision logic;
	5.	refer matters for civil, criminal, or constitutional enforcement.

Claims of classification, secrecy, national security, or proprietary interest shall not defeat jurisdiction, subject only to narrowly tailored handling procedures.

⸻

Section 7. Mandatory Referral and Non-Discretion

Where an Inspector General finds credible evidence of:
	1.	constitutional violation;
	2.	capture;
	3.	corruption;
	4.	systemic concealment;
	5.	retaliation against whistleblowers;

the Inspector General shall refer the matter to the Constitutional Judicial Commission and the Constitutional Review Court, and to appropriate prosecutorial authorities.
Failure to refer constitutes misconduct.

⸻

Section 8. Reporting and Public Disclosure

Inspectors General shall issue regular public reports detailing:
	1.	investigations initiated and concluded;
	2.	findings of fact;
	3.	referrals made;
	4.	patterns of systemic risk;
	5.	instances of obstruction or non-compliance.

Redactions shall be minimal, time-limited, and justified on the record.

⸻

Section 9. Whistleblower Protection and Access

Any person may submit information to an Inspector General.

Whistleblowers shall be protected from retaliation by constitutional right.

Retaliation constitutes a distinct and grave offense.

Inspectors General shall maintain secure channels for confidential disclosure.

⸻

Section 10. Anti-Obstruction and Anti-Retaliation

Obstruction of an Inspector General, including delay, deception, intimidation, budgetary interference, or dismissal without cause, is prohibited.

Such conduct constitutes evidence of capture and shall trigger heightened scrutiny and mandatory referral.

⸻

Section 11. Coordination with Public Records and Courts

The IGS shall operate in coordination with:
	•	Article XXXIX (Public Records);
	•	Article VI (Judiciary).

Records generated by the IGS are public records, subject only to narrow, temporary protections.

Courts shall not defer to executive claims that frustrate oversight.

⸻

Section 12. Limits of Authority

Inspectors General shall not:
	1.	issue binding legal judgments;
	2.	grant immunity;
	3.	suppress prosecution;
	4.	substitute for judicial process.

The IGS is an exposure and referral body, not a parallel justice system.

⸻

Section 13. Liability and Accountability

Inspectors General are subject to discipline, removal, and liability for:
	1.	corruption;
	2.	willful neglect;
	3.	abuse of authority;
	4.	knowing concealment;
	5.	retaliatory conduct.

Independence does not confer impunity.


⸻

Section 14. Emergency and Continuity

No emergency, national security claim, or continuity doctrine shall suspend the operation of the IGS.

Oversight persists in crisis.

⸻

Section 15. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to maximize transparency, deter capture, protect whistleblowers, and ensure that constitutional accountability is not displaced by procedural compliance.

Where doubt exists, the construction that preserves the full force of Article XI shall control.
