Article VIII-E — Concentrations of Private Power
Charge
Economic liberty thrives in open markets where productive commerce flourishes through merit, innovation, and voluntary exchange. However, concentrated private economic power can undermine competition, suppress innovation, impair labor mobility, distort markets, and erode civic self-government. This Article constitutionalizes an anti-oligarchy duty: scale is tolerated, but no private actor or coordinated structure may accumulate or exercise power that materially harms competitive liberty or constitutional order.
⸻
Section 1. Principle of Competitive Liberty
(a) Competitive Conditions as a Constitutional Interest. The Republic affirms that free competition, open markets, labor mobility, innovation, interoperability, and civic autonomy are essential to economic liberty and democratic self-government.
(b) Prohibition on Harmful Concentrations. No private entity, combination, coordinated structure, or beneficial-ownership aggregation shall possess or exercise power sufficient to substantially impair the conditions in subsection (a) through exclusionary practices, collusion, lock-in, rent-seeking, shadow governance, or other conduct that materially undermines competitive liberty or constitutional order.
(c) Scale Not Unlawful Per Se; No Permanence. Scale, dominance, or exclusive control is not unlawful per se. However, no monopoly, oligopoly, cartel, or dominant enterprise has any presumption of permanence, immunity, indispensability, or entitlement to continued existence.
(d) Evidence-Based Enforcement. Enforcement shall follow measurable harms, durable indicators of exclusion or capture, and evidentiary proof; scale alone does not trigger structural remedy absent evidence of abuse or material impairment of the conditions in subsection (a).
In determining whether a concentration materially impairs competitive liberty, courts may consider evidence of Rent-Seeking, Parasitic Practices, or Shadow Government as defined in Article 0.
⸻
Section 2. Federal Authority and Affirmative Duty
(a) Duty. The federal government has the authority and the affirmative duty to prevent, limit, regulate, or dissolve concentrations of private economic or institutional power that materially undermine: (1) free and fair competition;
(2) the ability of individuals to enter, exit, or participate in markets or professions;
(3) innovation, interoperability, or open access to essential goods, services, or infrastructure; or
(4) civic independence, democratic governance, or constitutional order.
In determining whether a concentration materially impairs competitive liberty, courts may consider evidence of Rent-Seeking, Parasitic Practices, or Shadow Government as defined in Article 0.
(b) No Contrary Construction. No statute, executive policy, or administrative construction may negate, suspend, or materially weaken this duty.
Where the record shows organized schemes of Rent-Seeking, Parasitic Practices, or Shadow Government, no presumption of permanence applies and structural remedy preference shall control.
⸻
Section 3. Structural Remedies Preferred
(a) Structural Correction Where Structural Harm Exists. Where a court finds a violation of this Article, remedies shall prioritize structural correction, including: (1) dissolution, divestiture, separation, or restructuring; (2) mandatory interoperability, open standards, nondiscriminatory access, or data portability where necessary to restore competitive conditions; (3) prohibition of exclusionary, tying, predatory, lock-in, or collusive practices; and (4) restoration of competitive conditions through durable measures.
(b) Behavioral Measures Not a Substitute. Fines, settlements, or behavioral commitments may supplement but shall not substitute for structural remedies where structural harm exists or persists.
Where the record shows organized schemes of Rent-Seeking, Parasitic Practices, or Shadow Government, no presumption of permanence applies and structural remedy preference shall control.
(c) Successor Evasion Prohibited. Courts may prohibit reconstitution through successor entities, shells, proxies, affiliates, or materially equivalent combinations to effectuate remedies.
⸻
Section 4. Neutral Enforcement
Enforcement shall not depend upon political alignment, ideology, sectoral popularity, or asserted social utility. No private actor shall be exempted on grounds of convenience, influence, employment impact, market position, or claimed indispensability.
⸻
Section 5. Legislative Implementation and Evidentiary Standards
(a) Implementing Law Permitted. The Legislature may enact implementing law defining procedures and evidentiary standards, provided no such law negates, dilutes, or materially weakens the duties or structural remedies herein imposed.
(b) Structural Remedy Standard. Where a remedy is structural in nature, the Republic shall prove the constitutional violation and the necessity of the structural remedy by clear and convincing evidence, unless a higher standard is otherwise required by this Constitution.
⸻
Section 6. Enforcement Routing and Due Process
Structural remedies and compulsory measures under this Article shall be imposed by courts only, pursuant to due process of law. Investigations and prosecutions may be routed through the Economic Constitutional Enforcement Directorate under Article VIII-D, subject to its strict jurisdictional limits, judicial subordination, transparency duties, and absolute prohibitions.
⸻
Section 7. Construction and Lock Protection
This Article supplements Article VIII and shall be construed in favor of competitive liberty and against oligarchic consolidation. Structural remedy preference and neutrality requirements are lock-protected pursuant to Article XV.
