Article VIII-B — Prohibition of Predatory Economic Practices

Section 1. Non-Derogation and Relationship to Article VIII

This Article supplements Article VIII — Economic Structure and Stewardship.

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to narrow, dilute, suspend, or reinterpret the principles, prohibitions, caps, ratios, or safeguards established in Article VIII or Article VIII-A.

Where doubt exists, the construction that most restrains exploitation and protects human dignity shall control.

⸻

Section 2. Purpose

This Article prohibits economic practices that extract value through deception, coercion, structural asymmetry, or psychological manipulation, even where nominal consent is claimed.

Economic freedom does not include the freedom to prey upon dependency, ignorance, or desperation.

⸻

Section 3. Predatory Practices Defined

Predatory economic practices include, but are not limited to:
	1.	Deceptive Omission — withholding material risks, costs, exit barriers, failure rates, or adverse outcomes reasonably necessary for informed consent;
	2.	Coercive Sales Architecture — high-pressure tactics, artificial scarcity, time-limited inducements, emotional leverage, or social pressure impairing free choice;
	3.	Recruitment-Driven Compensation — compensation derived primarily from recruiting participants rather than from bona fide goods or services sold to end users;
	4.	Asymmetric Entry and Exit — arrangements facilitating easy entry while imposing disproportionate penalties, forfeitures, lock-ins, or barriers to exit;
	5.	Psychological Exploitation as a Business Model — systematic reliance on cognitive, emotional, or informational asymmetry to induce transactions adverse to participants.
6.  Highly leveraged acquisitions — Highly leveraged acquisitions that encumber an operating enterprise with debt exceeding a constitutionally reasonable proportion of acquisition value, where such debt materially impairs productive operation, worker compensation, or long-term viability, shall be presumptively predatory.

Section 4. Invalidity of Consent

Consent obtained through predatory economic practices is invalid as a matter of law, notwithstanding the absence of an express false statement.

Waivers, acknowledgments, or disclaimers shall not cure predation.

This Section regulates conduct and transactional architecture, not protected expression.

⸻

Section 5. Prohibited Schemes

Schemes commonly characterized as confidence operations, pyramid schemes, multi-level marketing arrangements, or functionally equivalent structures are prohibited where they satisfy Section 3, regardless of nomenclature or formal design.

Substance shall control over form.

⸻

Section 6. Mandatory Cooling-Off Period for High-Risk Transactions

For any transaction designated by law as high-risk, including but not limited to:
	•	timeshare interests;
	•	investment contracts marketed to non-professionals;
	•	advance-fee services;
	•	long-term lock-in agreements;
	•	recruitment-based compensation schemes;

a mandatory cooling-off period shall apply.
	1.	The cooling-off period shall be no less than seven (7) days from execution or payment, whichever occurs first.
	2.	During this period, the purchaser or participant may rescind for any reason or no reason, without penalty, forfeiture, or adverse consequence.
	3.	Any attempt to waive, shorten, obscure, or condition the cooling-off period is void.

⸻

Section 7. Bright-Line Presumptions

Transactions subject to Section 6 are presumptively predatory where:
	1.	material risks, costs, or failure rates are not disclosed prominently and in plain language;
	2.	compensation is primarily derived from recruitment rather than end-user value; or
	3.	exit requires forfeiture, penalty, or continued payment disproportionate to any bona fide service rendered.

Such presumptions may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence.

⸻

Section 8. Enforcement and Remedies

Violations of this Article are actionable through:
	•	civil enforcement;
	•	injunctive relief;
	•	restitution and disgorgement;
	•	dissolution of offending entities;
	•	prohibition on reconstitution under successor names or structures;
	•	criminal referral where warranted.

Arbitration clauses, choice-of-law provisions, forum selection clauses, or class-action waivers shall not bar enforcement.
Where an enterprise enters insolvency within a defined period following extraordinary distributions to executives or controlling investors, such distributions shall be subject to mandatory clawback.

⸻

Section 9. Escalation and Severity

Where predatory economic practices are willful, systematic, concealed, or result in widespread harm, such conduct constitutes parasitic wealth extraction and qualifies as a grave offense under Article 0.

Such conduct is eligible for Tier-3 classification pursuant to Article VII.

No property right shall vest in proceeds derived from predatory conduct.

⸻

Section 10. Interpretation

This Article regulates conduct, not protected expression.

It shall be construed broadly to prevent evasion through rebranding, contractual form, technological mediation, jurisdictional fragmentation, or legal indirection.

Where doubt exists, the construction that most protects human dignity and economic freedom shall control.
