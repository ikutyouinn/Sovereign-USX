Article XLVI – Rex Pro Tempore and Total Defense Authority
Charge
This Article exists solely to give the President the power to lay waste to any enemy who dares declare war on the Republic. It does not grant the President the right to declare war on poverty, drugs, or any other social ill that cannot be fought by military means.
Section 1. Purpose, Non-Derogation, and Lock Protection
This Article exists solely to preserve the Republic against imminent existential destruction when ordinary constitutional processes cannot respond in time. It shall be construed narrowly, invoked reluctantly, and terminated immediately upon cessation of the threat.
Nothing herein authorizes:
	•	permanent alteration of constitutional structure;
	•	suspension or reinterpretation of lock-protected provisions (Article XV);
	•	derogation of unamendable core rights (life, due process in non-sabotage cases, free conscience absent direct enemy action);
	•	consolidation of power beyond the acute defense phase; or
	•	use as pretext for ordinary governance, political suppression, or entrenchment.
This Article is lock-protected per Article XV: no amendment, suspension, reinterpretation, or circumvention may dilute its narrow scope, strict triggers, automatic sunsets, or accountability mechanisms except by the highest procedural threshold and explicit certification of non-diminishment.
Section 2. Triggering Conditions (Existential Threat Certification)
Total Defense Authority activates only upon certification of a clear, imminent, and existential threat to the Republic's survival, limited to: 
a. large-scale armed invasion of sovereign territory by foreign military forces;
b. sustained, coordinated attacks causing or imminently likely to cause mass civilian casualties or total collapse of essential national infrastructure;
c. credible, imminent nuclear, biological, chemical, or comparably catastrophic attack expected within hours or days;
d. armed insurrection materially directed or substantially supported by a foreign adversary, where ordinary processes (including federalized militia and Article XXIV mechanisms) cannot contain it in time to prevent existential harm.
The President shall issue a written finding specifying the factual basis, transmitted immediately (within 4 hours) to:
	•	both chambers of the Legislature;
	•	the Constitutional Review Court (CRC);
	•	the Constitutional Judicial Commission (CJC);
	•	the Supreme Court of the Republic;
	•	and the public (redactions only for strictly operational security, subject to immediate CRC review).
The CRC shall have original jurisdiction to review and vacate the finding if it fails clear-and-convincing evidentiary standards or exceeds the enumerated triggers. CJC concurrence is required for activation if institutional abuse is alleged.
Transmission within 4 hours satisfies any longer notice window elsewhere in this Constitution.
Section 3. Designation and Scope of Authority
Upon valid activation, the President temporarily assumes the designation President Rex Pro Tempore (Latin: "King for the Time Being" — denoting temporary, emergency-only supreme defensive command) and exercises Total Defense Authority solely to repel or neutralize the existential threat.
This is not a new office or title; it confers no permanence and expires per Section 6.
Section 4. Limited Powers in the Acute Phase
The President Rex Pro Tempore may exercise only the following, each strictly necessary and proportional to the certified threat: a. unified command of all federal armed forces, reserves, National Guard (federalized per law), and lawfully constituted militia; b. requisition of private resources, infrastructure, or industrial capacity essential for immediate defense (with mandatory post-crisis compensation at fair market value plus interest); c. conscription or compulsory national service only when voluntary means are demonstrably insufficient (time-limited, subject to legislative override); d. temporary suspension of non-essential procedural requirements (e.g., certain permitting delays) that would render timely defensive action impossible.
All actions must directly advance defense and cease upon threat resolution.
Section 5. Absolute Prohibitions (Non-Derogable)
Even under Total Defense Authority, the President Rex Pro Tempore shall not:
a. amend, suspend, reinterpret, or bypass any provision of this Constitution;
b. abolish, postpone, or interfere with elections or political processes except as narrowly required to protect polling sites from direct attack (any such measure expires with the acute phase);
c. criminalize, censor, or punish speech, dissent, association, religion, or political opposition unrelated to direct sabotage, espionage, or enemy coordination;
d. alter the structure, independence, jurisdiction, or composition of the judiciary, Legislature, states, or constitutional oversight bodies (CRC, CJC);
e. expand authority for economic, social, ideological, or partisan purposes;
f. delegate Total Defense Authority to any unelected body or private actor;
g. create generally applicable rules or new legal obligations outside immediate defense/mitigation operations; all such rules require ordinary law.
Violation of any prohibition constitutes grave (Tier Three) constitutional malfeasance, triggering mandatory CJC investigation and CRC nullification.
Section 6. Automatic Sunset, Ratification, and Renewal
Total Defense Authority expires automatically after 72 hours unless ratified by simple majority of both legislative chambers.
Upon ratification, authority continues for up to 90 days.
Renewal beyond 90 days requires: a. 60% supermajority of both chambers; b. renewed CRC certification that the existential threat persists (clear and convincing evidence); c. CJC certification that no abuse, prolongation, or deviation has occurred.
The President may not unilaterally renew or extend. Failure to meet renewal thresholds causes immediate reversion to ordinary governance.
Section 7. Termination, Reversion, and Restoration
Upon expiration or termination: a. all emergency orders lapse automatically unless re-enacted by ordinary law; b. requisitioned property returns or is compensated within 180 days; c. emergency detentions convert to ordinary criminal/civil process or terminate; d. suspended procedures restore immediately; e. no emergency precedent survives or justifies future action.
Section 8. Mandatory Post-Crisis Review and Accountability
Within 30 days of termination, the CJC and CRC shall jointly conduct a public review assessing:
	•	necessity and proportionality;
	•	adherence to limits;
	•	duration and any prolongation;
	•	evidence of abuse, profiteering, suppression, or bad-faith invocation.
Findings are public; abuse triggers mandatory referral for grave offense prosecution (Article VII), removal/disqualification, and civil liability. No immunity applies.
Section 9. Popular Override and Removal
Upon petition by 10% of Civic Citizens (corrected from your 20% typo), a national referendum may: a. nullify specific ultra vires actions; b. remove the President for abuse or bad-faith invocation.
Approval requires 60% of Civic Citizens voting. Interference constitutes malfeasance.
Section 10. Conscription and Civic Credit
Any person conscripted under this Article who does not have a criminal record barring them from voting or holding office shall not have their conscription manipulated, delayed, or otherwise gamed to avoid granting them credit toward Civic Citizenship under Article III.
Upon conscription, the two-year time clock for earning such credit begins immediately for those who have not already served, and may not be manipulated, suspended, or otherwise gamed to avoid rendering the credit due, unless the recruit leaves voluntarily or is dishonorably discharged for cause, subject to due process.
Section 11. Interpretation and Supremacy
This Article shall be interpreted to: a. enable swift, decisive defense against genuine existential peril; b. prevent any emergency from becoming permanent or pretextual; c. prioritize rapid restoration of constitutional normalcy; d. treat abuse more severely than defensive hesitation.
In conflict with any other provision, this Article's narrow constraints and safeguards control. The Republic endures its enemies without becoming one.
