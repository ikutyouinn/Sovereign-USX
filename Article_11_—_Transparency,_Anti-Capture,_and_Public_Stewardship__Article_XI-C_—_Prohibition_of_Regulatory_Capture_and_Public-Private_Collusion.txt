Article XI-C — Prohibition of Regulatory Capture and Public-Private Collusion
Charge
This subarticle exists to prevent the capture of public authority by private interests, the erosion of republican accountability through revolving influence, and the substitution of nominal regulation for actual public stewardship.  This Subarticle enforces and operationalizes the principles of transparency, accountability, and public stewardship established in Article XI.  Public power shall be exercised for the People, not negotiated away through access, incentives, or deferred reward.
Section 1. Prohibition of Regulatory Capture
No regulatory body, agency, commission, or delegated authority may be structured, operated, or incentivized in a manner that materially aligns its interests with those of the entities it regulates.  Capture shall be presumed where: 1. regulatory outcomes consistently favor regulated entities over the public interest; 2. enforcement is selectively delayed, waived, or nullified; 3. regulatory standards are authored, dictated, or materially shaped by regulated parties.  Such arrangements are unconstitutional.
Section 2. Revolving-Door Restrictions
No person who exercises regulatory, supervisory, enforcement, or rule-making authority over an industry shall: 1. accept employment, compensation, equity, or advisory roles from a regulated entity within a substantial cooling-off period prescribed by law; 2. negotiate future employment or compensation while exercising public authority; 3. receive deferred benefits, contingent rewards, or indirect remuneration connected to regulatory outcomes.  Violation constitutes a grave civic offense.
Section 3. Non-Delegation of Public Authority
Legislative, regulatory, or enforcement authority shall not be delegated to private entities, trade associations, standards bodies, or industry consortia in a manner that binds the public.  Private expertise may inform regulation; it shall not control, veto, or substitute for public judgment.  Any rule, standard, or enforcement mechanism authored or enforced by private actors without full public accountability is void.
Section 4. Public-Private Collusion Prohibited
No public official or agency may coordinate with private entities to: 1. suppress lawful competition, derivative creation, or market entry; 2. delay, evade, or dilute enforcement of law; 3. manufacture compliance narratives that defeat constitutional rights; 4. substitute informal agreements for lawful process.  “Public-private partnership” shall not shield unconstitutional coordination.
Section 5. Transparency and Auditability
All regulatory processes shall be subject to: 1. public disclosure of communications with regulated entities; 2. auditable rulemaking records; 3. traceable authorship of regulatory language.  Failure to maintain transparency creates a rebuttable presumption of capture.
Section 6. Enforcement and Standing
Any person harmed by regulatory capture shall have standing to challenge such action.  Courts shall apply strict scrutiny to arrangements plausibly enabling capture and shall invalidate structures that place private interests in a position of effective control.  No immunity attaches by virtue of office, delegation, or statutory authorization.
Section 7. Construction and Supremacy
This Article shall be construed: • broadly against capture, • narrowly against delegation of public power, • in favor of public accountability and republican legitimacy.  No statute, regulation, treaty, or contract may override or narrow these prohibitions.
Section 8. Lock Scope
The prohibitions on regulatory capture, revolving-door influence, private delegation, and public-private collusion are structural and non-derogable.  They may not be suspended, diluted, or bypassed by emergency, economic necessity, or administrative convenience.
