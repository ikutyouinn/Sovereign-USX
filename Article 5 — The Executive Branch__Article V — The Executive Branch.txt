Article V — The Executive Branch

Charge

This Article establishes the authority, duties, and limits of the executive branch of the Republic. Executive power shall be exercised solely for the faithful execution of the law and shall not be used to create, suspend, alter, or evade law except where expressly authorized by this Constitution. All executive actions, directives, and assertions of emergency or discretionary authority shall be construed narrowly and shall remain subject to legislative constraint and judicial review.


Section 1. Vesting of Executive Authority
 
(a). Vesting of Executive Authority
 
The executive power of the Republic is vested in a President, who shall serve as the chief executive officer of the Republic and shall execute the laws faithfully, subject at all times to this Constitution.
 
The President is not the source of law, policy, or authority, but the instrument for lawful execution.
 

 
(b). Enumerated Nature of Executive Power
 
Executive authority exists only as expressly enumerated by this Constitution and by laws enacted pursuant to it.
 
No executive power shall be construed to arise from:
• implication,
• historical practice,
• necessity,
• emergency,
• national security,
• custom,
• or prerogative.
 
Any claim of inherent, residual, implied, or emergency executive power is expressly repudiated.
 

 
(c). Execution Distinguished from Lawmaking
 
The Executive shall execute and administer the law as written.
 
Execution does not include:
• creating generally applicable rules,
• expanding statutory scope,
• imposing new obligations or prohibitions,
• conditioning rights or benefits beyond statute,
• or substituting executive judgment for legislative choice.
 
Any executive action that binds private conduct, alters legal rights, or establishes general rules shall constitute unlawful lawmaking and is void.
 

 
(d). Duty of Constitutional Fidelity
 
The President and all executive officers bear an independent and non-delegable duty to uphold the Constitution.
 
No officer may excuse unconstitutional action by:
• delegation,
• reliance on counsel,
• classification,
• internal executive interpretation,
• or superior order.
 
Unconstitutional orders are unlawful and shall not be obeyed.
 

 
(e). Limits on Administrative Authority
 
Administrative discretion exists solely to carry out lawful execution within clearly defined statutory bounds.
 
Discretion shall not be used to:
• alter legislative intent,
• evade statutory limits,
• create de facto policy,
• or regulate by enforcement selection.
 
Administrative acts exceeding these bounds are unconstitutional and void.
 

 
(f). Enforceability and Standing
 
Any act of the Executive Branch that exceeds or contravenes the authority granted by this Article is void ab initio.
 
Standing to challenge such acts is granted to:
1.  any person subject to or affected by the act;
2.  any member of the Legislature;
3.  any Inspector General or Special Prosecutor;
4.  the Constitutional Judicial Commission.
 
No showing of special injury beyond constitutional violation shall be required.
 

 
(g). Mandatory Judicial Review
 
Upon a prima facie showing that executive authority has been exceeded, the Constitutional Review Court shall review the act on an expedited basis.
 
No court may decline review on grounds of:
• political question doctrine,
• executive discretion,
• necessity,
• national security deference,
• or historical practice.
 

 
(h). Consequences of Ultra Vires Action
 
Any executive officer who knowingly authorizes, orders, or enforces an unconstitutional act commits constitutional malfeasance.
 
Such malfeasance shall result in:
1.  immediate cessation of the unlawful act;
2.  personal liability where harm is caused;
3.  mandatory referral for investigation under Section 5;
4.  disqualification from office where willfulness is established.
 
Good-faith reliance does not excuse continued enforcement once invalidity is determined.
 

 
(i). Relationship to Emergency Powers
 
No provision of this Section may be suspended, reinterpreted, or bypassed by an emergency declaration.
 
Emergency powers, where permitted, operate within these limits and confer no additional authority.
 
Section 2. Restrictions on Executive Authority
 
(a) Non-Suspension of Constitutional Rights
 
The Executive Branch shall not suspend, derogate, condition, or diminish any right guaranteed by this Constitution, whether directly or indirectly, including by emergency declaration, regulation, executive order, guidance, enforcement priority, or omission.
 
No balancing test, necessity claim, or national security rationale shall justify infringement of constitutional rights.

(b) No Rule by Decree
 
The Executive shall not govern by decree.
 
No executive order, proclamation, directive, memorandum, or guidance may substitute for law enacted by the Legislature, nor may any such instrument create new legal obligations, prohibitions, penalties, or conditions applicable to persons or entities outside the Executive Branch.

(c) No Executive Lawmaking or Policy Substitution
 
The Executive shall not:
	•	create generally applicable rules;
	•	expand or narrow statutory scope;
	•	impose policy preferences not enacted by law;
	•	condition access to rights, benefits, or services beyond statute.
 
Any such act constitutes unlawful lawmaking and is void.

(d) No Circumvention by Delegation or Interpretation
 
The Executive shall not evade the restrictions of this Section through:
	•	delegation to agencies or contractors;
	•	reliance on interpretive guidance;
	•	selective enforcement or non-enforcement;
	•	classification or secrecy;
	•	informal coordination bodies, task forces, or advisors.
 
Substance shall control over form.

(e) No Control of Elections or Political Process
 
The Executive shall not interfere with:
	•	the timing, conduct, or certification of elections;
	•	voter eligibility or ballot access;
	•	political association, candidacy, or opposition activity.
 
Any executive action affecting electoral processes is presumptively unconstitutional.

(f) No Financial Coercion Beyond Law
 
The Executive shall not:
	•	expend public funds absent lawful appropriation;
	•	condition funding to coerce political or constitutional compliance;
	•	reprogram funds to achieve objectives not authorized by law.

(g) No Militarization of Civil Authority
 
The Executive shall not deploy military or paramilitary forces for domestic governance, law enforcement, or political control except as expressly authorized by this Constitution and subject to civilian judicial oversight.
 
Military necessity shall not override constitutional restraint.

(h) Automatic Nullity
 
Any executive action taken in violation of this Section is void ab initio and without legal effect.
 
No validating statute, emergency declaration, internal approval, or subsequent ratification may cure such invalidity.

(i) Standing and Cause of Action
 
Standing to challenge violations of this Section is granted to:
	•	any person directly or indirectly affected;
	•	any member of the Legislature;
	•	any Inspector General or Special Prosecutor;
	•	the Constitutional Judicial Commission.
 
No exhaustion of administrative remedies shall be required.

(j) Mandatory Judicial Review
 
The Constitutional Review Court shall hear claims arising under this Section on an expedited basis.
 
No court may decline review on grounds of:
	•	political question doctrine;
	•	executive discretion;
	•	necessity or emergency;
	•	national security deference;
	•	historical practice.

(k) Personal Responsibility
 
Any executive officer who knowingly authorizes, orders, or enforces an action prohibited by this Section commits constitutional malfeasance.
 
Such malfeasance shall result in:
	•	immediate cessation of the unlawful act;
	•	personal civil liability where harm is shown;
	•	mandatory referral for investigation under Section 5;
	•	disqualification from office where willfulness is established.

(l) Duty to Refuse Unlawful Orders
 
No executive officer or employee shall obey an order that violates this Section.
 
Compliance with unlawful orders is not a defense once unconstitutionality is apparent.

Section 3 — Election, Term, Removal, and Succession

(a) Election and Term

The President shall be elected by the People in the manner prescribed by this Constitution and shall serve a fixed term of office.

No extension, suspension, or alteration of the presidential term shall occur except by constitutional amendment.



(b) Oath and Commencement of Authority

The President shall assume executive authority only upon taking the constitutional oath of office.

No person may exercise presidential authority prior to the lawful commencement of the term or after its lawful conclusion.



(c) Grounds for Removal

The President may be removed from office for:
	1.	constitutional malfeasance;
	2.	willful violation of this Constitution;
	3.	treason or other high crimes as defined herein;
	4.	incapacity rendering the President unable to discharge the duties of office.

Political disagreement or lawful exercise of constitutional authority shall not constitute grounds for removal.



(d) Legislative Removal Process

The Legislature shall have the authority to initiate removal proceedings.

Removal shall require:
	1.	formal charges adopted by the lower chamber; and
	2.	conviction by the upper chamber upon the evidentiary standard prescribed by this Constitution.

Proceedings shall be conducted publicly, except where narrowly necessary to protect classified information, and shall be subject to judicial review for constitutional compliance.



(e) Mandatory Timelines

Removal proceedings, once initiated, shall proceed without undue delay.

No chamber may suspend, stall, or indefinitely defer proceedings once charges are formally adopted.

Failure to act within prescribed timelines constitutes constitutional malfeasance.



(f) Judicial Review

The Supreme Court of the Republic shall have original jurisdiction to review:
	1.	the constitutional sufficiency of charges;
	2.	compliance with procedural requirements; and
	3.	the validity of removal or acquittal.

The political question doctrine shall not apply.



(g) Temporary Incapacity

Where the President is temporarily unable to discharge the duties of office, authority shall pass to the Vice President as Acting President, pursuant to procedures established by law.

Determinations of incapacity shall be subject to:
	1.	medical certification;
	2.	legislative oversight; and
	3.	expedited judicial review.



(h) Permanent Incapacity or Vacancy

In the event of death, resignation, lawful removal, or permanent incapacity, the Vice President shall assume the office of President for the remainder of the term.

If no Vice President is available, succession shall proceed as provided by law, consistent with this Constitution.



(i) Popular Removal

The People retain the sovereign authority to remove the President from office.

Upon petition by twenty percent (20%) of Civic Citizens, a national removal vote shall be held.

Removal shall occur upon approval by two-thirds (2/3) of Civic Citizens voting.

Interference with this process constitutes constitutional malfeasance.



(j) Effect of Removal

Upon removal:
	1.	presidential authority shall cease immediately;
	2.	all executive orders issued in violation of this Constitution shall be void;
	3.	the removed officer shall remain subject to civil and criminal liability as provided by law.

Removal from office does not constitute immunity from prosecution.



(k) Continuity and Stability

No removal, resignation, or succession shall suspend the operation of law, courts, or constitutional rights.

Continuity of government shall be maintained at all times within constitutional bounds.



Section 4 — Executive Departments, Cabinet, and Temporary Offices

(a) Executive Departments

The Executive Branch shall be composed of executive departments established by law.

No department may be created, merged, dissolved, or substantially reorganized except by statute enacted by the Legislature.



(b) Cabinet

The heads of executive departments shall constitute the Cabinet.

Cabinet officers:
	1.	shall be appointed in the manner prescribed by law;
	2.	shall exercise authority only within the statutory scope of their departments; and
	3.	shall remain individually accountable for constitutional compliance.

No Cabinet officer may exercise authority outside the department to which they are appointed.



(c) Prohibition on Shadow Governance

No informal, parallel, or shadow executive structure shall exercise supervisory, coordinating, or directive authority over executive departments.

Authority shall flow only through offices created and governed in accordance with this Constitution.



(d) Temporary Executive Offices and Coordinators

The President may establish temporary executive offices, task forces, special teams, or executive coordinators solely to assist in the execution of existing law.

Such entities are collectively governed by this Section, regardless of title or form.



(e) Purpose and Scope

Any temporary executive office or coordinator shall:
	1.	be created for a specific, narrowly defined purpose;
	2.	possess no independent regulatory or rulemaking authority;
	3.	issue no binding directives outside the Executive Branch; and
	4.	exist solely to coordinate lawful execution within established departments.



(f) Time Limits

A temporary executive office or coordinator shall exist for no more than eighteen (18) months from the date of creation.



(g) Extension Requirements

A temporary executive office may be extended only upon:
	1.	approval by Congress every six (6) months by majority vote of each chamber;
	2.	initial certification by Constitutional Review Court that the office remains necessary, narrowly tailored, and constitutionally compliant; and
	3.	notwithstanding the right of the Supreme Court of the Republic to review the case and decide if it has merit to the interpretation of the constitution.

No extension may exceed six (6) months.



(h) Automatic Dissolution

Upon expiration of its authorized term:
	1.	the temporary office or coordinator shall be automatically dissolved;
	2.	all delegated authority shall cease;
	3.	all employment, contracts, and assignments shall terminate.

No residual authority may persist after dissolution.



(i) No Carryover Between Administrations

No temporary executive office or coordinator may persist beyond the term of the President who created it.

Continuation under a subsequent President requires reconstitution as a new office, with new staff and fresh approvals under this Section.



(j) Popular Dissolution

Any temporary executive office or coordinator may be dissolved by the People upon:
	1.	petition by twenty percent (20%) of Civic Citizens; and
	2.	approval by two-thirds (2/3) of Civic Citizens voting.

Dissolution shall take effect within seventy-two (72) hours of certification.



(k) Anti-Evasion Rule

No executive office may evade the requirements of this Section through:
	•	renaming or rebranding;
	•	subdivision or consolidation;
	•	informal delegation;
	•	classification as advisory; or
	•	placement within another office.

Substance shall control over form.



Section 5 — Oversight, Inspectors General, and Special Prosecutors

(a) Independent Oversight Required

Independent oversight of the Executive Branch is a constitutional requirement.

Inspectors General and Special Prosecutors shall exist to investigate illegality, constitutional violations, abuse of authority, fraud, corruption, obstruction, and retaliation within the Executive Branch.



(b) Inspectors General

An Inspector General shall exist for each executive department and for any executive agency designated by law.

Inspectors General shall:
	1.	operate independently of department leadership;
	2.	have authority to access all records, personnel, and facilities necessary to perform constitutional duties; and
	3.	report findings without alteration, suppression, or delay.



(c) Appointment and Continuity

Inspectors General shall be appointed in the manner prescribed by law and shall continue in office notwithstanding changes in administration.

A vacancy shall be filled within thirty (30) days.

If the Executive fails to appoint within the required period, the CJC shall designate an interim candidate list (integrity screen), and the CRC shall confirm by expedited order, until a lawful appointment is made.



(d) Removal for Cause Only

An Inspector General or Special Prosecutor may be removed only for:
	1.	demonstrated incapacity;
	2.	criminal conviction; or
	3.	proven misconduct unrelated to the substance or targets of any investigation.

Removal requires:
	•	written findings;
	•	immediate notice to the Legislature and the Constitutional Judicial Commission; and
	•	expedited judicial review.

Improper removal is void.



(e) Special Prosecutors

A Special Prosecutor shall be appointed when:
	1.	credible evidence indicates executive misconduct implicating senior officials;
	2.	an Inspector General makes a referral;
	3.	the Legislature so directs; or
	4.	the Constitutional Judicial Commission makes a referral to the Constitutional Review Court who approves the appointment.

Special Prosecutors shall be independent of executive control and shall exercise prosecutorial authority as provided by law.



(f) Mandatory Investigation Triggers

An Inspector General or Special Prosecutor shall initiate an investigation upon receipt of:
	1.	credible evidence of constitutional or statutory violation;
	2.	a protected whistleblower disclosure;
	3.	a referral from a court, legislative committee, or the Constitutional Judicial Commission; or
	4.	evidence of obstruction or retaliation.

Failure to initiate an investigation within seven (7) days requires written justification, logged publicly and subject to review by the Constitutional Judicial Commission.

Failure to act on a referral from the Constitutional Judicial Commission constitutes prima facie evidence of obstruction.


(g) Subpoena Authority and Enforcement

Inspectors General and Special Prosecutors may issue subpoenas for testimony, documents, and records.

Subpoenas shall be complied with within ten (10) days, unless extended by a court for good cause shown.

Courts shall enforce subpoenas on an expedited basis.

No claim of executive privilege, classification, or internal policy shall bar production, subject only to secure handling procedures.



(h) Budgetary Independence

Inspectors General and Special Prosecutors shall receive separate, line-item appropriations sufficient to carry out constitutional duties.

Funding shall not be reduced below the prior fiscal year’s level except by:
	1.	a two-thirds vote of each chamber of the Legislature; and
	2.	certification by the Constitutional Judicial Commission that oversight capacity is not impaired.

Budgetary manipulation intended to obstruct oversight constitutes constitutional malfeasance.



(i) Anti-Retaliation and Obstruction

Retaliation against witnesses, whistleblowers, or oversight personnel, or obstruction of oversight activities, constitutes constitutional malfeasance.

Such acts shall trigger mandatory investigation and referral.



(j) Duty to Refer

Where probable cause exists that a constitutional offense has occurred, an Inspector General or Special Prosecutor shall refer the matter for prosecution in accordance with law.

Failure to refer absent written justification constitutes malfeasance.



(k) Transparency and Reporting

Findings of Inspectors General and Special Prosecutors shall be reported publicly, subject only to narrow redactions necessary to protect ongoing investigations or classified material.

Classification shall not be used to conceal illegality or constitutional violations.



Section 6 — Executive Crimes, Malfeasance, and Mandatory Referral

(a) Constitutional Malfeasance Defined

Constitutional malfeasance occurs when an executive officer knowingly or recklessly:
	1.	exceeds constitutional authority;
	2.	violates an express constitutional prohibition;
	3.	obstructs constitutional oversight;
	4.	retaliates against lawful whistleblowers or witnesses; or
	5.	abuses office to entrench power, evade accountability, or suppress lawful opposition.

Constitutional malfeasance is distinct from policy error or good-faith disagreement.



(b) Mens Rea

Executive constitutional offenses require one of the following mental states:
	1.	Willfulness — conscious intent to violate this Constitution;
	2.	Knowing disregard — awareness of a substantial risk of unconstitutionality and proceeding anyway;
	3.	Recklessness — conscious indifference to constitutional limits where duty to know exists.

Negligence alone shall not constitute constitutional malfeasance.



(c) No Immunity by Office

No executive officer, including the President, Vice President, or Cabinet officers, shall possess immunity from investigation, indictment, or prosecution for constitutional offenses.

Office shall not shield unlawful conduct.



(d) Duty to Refuse Unconstitutional Orders

No executive officer or employee shall obey an order that is unconstitutional on its face or whose unconstitutionality is reasonably apparent.

Compliance with unlawful orders does not excuse liability once constitutional violation is known or should have been known.



(e) Mandatory Referral

Where probable cause exists that a constitutional offense has occurred, referral for investigation or prosecution is mandatory.

Mandatory referral shall be triggered by:
	1.	an Inspector General;
	2.	a Special Prosecutor;
	3.	a court;
	4.	the Legislature; or
	5.	the Constitutional Judicial Commission.

Failure to refer absent written justification constitutes constitutional malfeasance.



(f) Suspension Pending Adjudication

Upon formal finding of probable cause for constitutional malfeasance, an executive officer may be suspended from duties pending adjudication, pursuant to procedures established by law.

Suspension shall not be punitive and shall not imply guilt.



(g) No Pardon for Constitutional Offenses

No pardon, commutation, or clemency may be granted for:
	1.	constitutional malfeasance;
	2.	obstruction of constitutional oversight;
	3.	retaliation against whistleblowers; or
	4.	offenses arising from abuse of executive authority.



(h) Relationship to Removal

Criminal liability under this Section is independent of removal proceedings under Section 3.

Acquittal in removal proceedings shall not bar criminal prosecution, and criminal prosecution shall not substitute for removal where removal is warranted.



(i) Non-Preemption by Statute

No statute, regulation, executive agreement, or internal policy may waive, narrow, or preempt liability for constitutional offenses defined by this Section.



(j) Evidentiary Access

Claims of executive privilege, classification, or national security shall not bar investigation or adjudication of constitutional offenses.

Courts shall establish secure procedures to receive sensitive evidence without foreclosing accountability.



(k) Referral to Article VII

Classification of offenses, tiers of severity, and authorized penalties for violations of this Section shall be governed exclusively by Article VII.

This Section establishes duty, liability, and referral, not punishment.



Section 7 — Emergency Powers

(a) Purpose and Narrow Construction

Emergency powers exist solely to permit the rapid execution of existing law in response to a sudden, extraordinary, and demonstrable threat that cannot be addressed through ordinary constitutional processes in time to prevent grave harm.

Emergency powers shall be construed narrowly and shall not create new authority.

This Section governs ordinary emergency declarations; existential defense authorities are governed exclusively by Article XLVI and Article XLVI-A.

(b) Conditions for Declaration

An emergency may be declared only upon a written finding that:
	1.	a concrete and imminent threat exists to life, territorial integrity, or constitutional order; and
	2.	ordinary legislative or administrative mechanisms are insufficient to address the threat within the required time.

Generalized risk, policy disagreement, economic conditions, or administrative convenience shall not constitute grounds for declaration.


(c) Form and Notice

Any emergency declaration shall:
	1.	be issued in writing;
	2.	specify the precise factual basis, geographic scope, and constitutional authority relied upon; and
	3.	be transmitted within twenty-four (24) hours to:
		•	both chambers of the Legislature;
		•	the Supreme Court of the Republic; and
		•	the Constitutional Review Court.

Failure to transmit voids the declaration.



(d) Immediate Constitutional Limits

During an emergency, the Executive shall not:
	1.	suspend, derogate, or condition constitutional rights;
	2.	alter election procedures, timing, or certification;
	3.	extend terms of office;
	4.	create new crimes or penalties;
	5.	authorize detention without charge;
	6.	censor lawful speech or press; or
	7.	expend funds absent lawful appropriation.



(e) Initial Duration

An emergency declaration shall expire automatically after seven (7) days unless renewed.

No emergency action may persist beyond expiration.



(f) Renewal Requirements
	1.	First renewal:
Requires a majority vote of each chamber and extends the emergency no more than fourteen (14) days.
	2.	Second renewal:
Requires a two-thirds vote of each chamber and extends the emergency no more than thirty (30) days.

Each renewal must include updated written findings satisfying subsection (b).



(g) Time Cap (Ordinary Emergencies)

No emergency declared under this Section may continue beyond ninety (90) total days unless this Constitution expressly authorizes extension under another Article.

Any extension must cite the specific Article relied upon and shall satisfy that Article’s procedures, findings, vote thresholds, and sunset terms.

Authorities activated under Article XLVI or Article XLVI-A are governed exclusively by their own sunset and renewal rules.

(h) Judicial Review
The Constitutional Review Court shall have original and mandatory jurisdiction to review:
	1.	the validity of any emergency declaration;
	2.	compliance with procedural requirements; and
	3.	the constitutionality of actions taken thereunder.

Decisions of the Constitutional Review Court shall be subject to expedited appeal to the Supreme Court of the Republic.

The political question doctrine shall not apply.



(i) Legislative Termination

The Legislature may terminate an emergency declaration at any time by simple majority vote of each chamber.

Termination shall be immediate and binding.



(j) Popular Termination

The People retain ultimate authority to terminate emergency powers.

Upon:
	1.	petition by twenty percent (20%) of Civic Citizens; and
	2.	approval by two-thirds (2/3) of Civic Citizens voting,

the emergency declaration and all emergency orders shall cease within seventy-two (72) hours.

Interference with this process constitutes constitutional malfeasance.



(k) Martial Law

Martial law may be imposed only where civilian courts are incapable of functioning and only upon:
	1.	certification by the Supreme Court; and
	2.	approval by the Legislature.

Martial law:
	•	shall not exceed fourteen (14) days;
	•	may be renewed once by two-thirds legislative vote; and
	•	shall never suspend constitutional rights or civilian judicial authority.



(l) Transparency and Recordkeeping

All emergency actions shall be:
	1.	logged contemporaneously;
	2.	archived publicly; and
	3.	subject to disclosure under this Constitution.

Secret emergency law is prohibited.



(m) No Emergency Laundering

Emergency powers shall not be used to:
	1.	entrench officeholders;
	2.	evade constitutional limits;
	3.	suppress lawful political opposition; or
	4.	create precedent for ordinary governance.

Emergency authority expires with the emergency and creates no residual power.



(n) Accountability

Knowingly issuing or enforcing emergency actions beyond the limits of this Section constitutes constitutional malfeasance and shall trigger mandatory referral under Section 6.


Section 8 — Pardons and Clemency

(a) Limited Clemency Authority

The President may grant pardons or commutations only for offenses defined by statute, subject to the limits of this Constitution.

Clemency is an act of mercy, not an act of governance.



(b) No Pardon for Constitutional Offenses

No pardon, commutation, or clemency may be granted for:
	1.	constitutional malfeasance;
	2.	abuse of executive authority;
	3.	obstruction of constitutional oversight;
	4.	retaliation against whistleblowers or witnesses; or
	5.	offenses arising from efforts to evade constitutional accountability.



(c) No Self-Pardon

No person may pardon or commute offenses committed by themselves.

Any attempt to do so is void.



(d) No Pardon for Co-Conspirators

No pardon or commutation may be granted to:
	1.	co-conspirators;
	2.	accomplices;
	3.	subordinates acting under unlawful orders; or
	4.	any person whose offense materially implicates the President,

where such grant would impair investigation, accountability, or judicial process.



(e) No Emergency Clemency

Clemency powers shall not be exercised:
	1.	during a declared emergency; or
	2.	for offenses arising from or connected to emergency actions,

until all emergency powers have expired and judicial review is complete.



(f) Transparency Requirement

All grants of pardon or commutation shall:
	1.	be issued in writing;
	2.	state the specific offense(s) covered;
	3.	include a public statement of reasons; and
	4.	be entered into a permanent public record.

Secret or undisclosed clemency is prohibited.



(g) No Erasure of Facts

A pardon or commutation:
	1.	shall not expunge records;
	2.	shall not erase findings of fact;
	3.	shall not bar civil liability; and
	4.	shall not preclude impeachment, removal, or professional discipline.



(h) Timing Restrictions

No pardon or commutation may be granted:
	1.	after formal charges are filed against the President;
	2.	after initiation of removal proceedings; or
	3.	within the final ninety (90) days of a presidential term,

except upon certification by the Constitutional Review Court, subject to appellate review by the Supreme Court of the Republic.



(i) Judicial Review

The Constitutional Review Court shall have mandatory jurisdiction to review:
	1.	the constitutional validity of any clemency grant; and
	2.	compliance with the requirements of this Section.

The political question doctrine shall not apply.



(j) Void Grants

Any clemency grant issued in violation of this Section is void ab initio and without legal effect.



(k) Accountability

Knowingly issuing or enforcing an unlawful clemency grant constitutes constitutional malfeasance and shall trigger mandatory referral under Section 6.



Section 9 — Transparency, Classification, and Whistleblowers

(a) No Secret Law

No executive action may bind, coerce, penalize, or deprive any person absent a publicly accessible statement of lawful authority.

Classified legal interpretations, secret directives, or undisclosed policies shall have no force against the People.



(b) Classification Authority Limited

Information may be classified only to protect legitimate national security interests and only to the minimum extent necessary.

Classification shall not be used to:
	1.	conceal illegality or constitutional violations;
	2.	evade oversight or judicial review;
	3.	suppress political accountability; or
	4.	prevent lawful disclosure of wrongdoing.



(c) Maximum Duration of Classification

No record, directive, or information may remain classified beyond twenty-five (25) years, unless extended in accordance with subsection (d).

Automatic declassification shall occur upon expiration.



(d) Extension of Classification
Classification may be extended only upon joint approval of:
	1.	a select national security committee composed of no fewer than ten (10) members of each chamber of the Legislature;
	2.	the Constitutional Review Court, by written order finding that continued secrecy satisfies constitutional standards; and
	3.	the Constitutional Judicial Commission, which shall certify that the request is not motivated by institutional self-protection, political embarrassment, concealment of wrongdoing, or capture.

Each extension may not exceed five (5) years.


(e) Public Override of Classification

Any classified record may be declassified upon:
	1.	petition by ten percent (10%) of Civic Citizens; and
	2.	approval by sixty percent (60%) of Civic Citizens voting.

Declassification pursuant to this subsection shall occur within seventy-two (72) hours of certification.



(f) Judicial Access

No claim of classification, executive privilege, or national security shall bar courts from access to evidence necessary to adjudicate constitutional claims.

Courts shall employ secure procedures to review sensitive material without foreclosing accountability.



(g) Whistleblower Protections

Any person who discloses, through protected channels, credible evidence of:
	1.	illegality;
	2.	constitutional violation;
	3.	abuse of authority;
	4.	fraud or corruption; or
	5.	obstruction of oversight

is protected under this Constitution.



(h) Protected Channels

Protected disclosures may be made to:
	1.	an Inspector General;
	2.	a Special Prosecutor;
	3.	a court under seal;
	4.	designated legislative committees; or
	5.	the Constitutional Judicial Commission.



(i) Anti-Retaliation Rule

Any adverse action taken within two (2) years of a protected disclosure is presumed retaliatory unless the government proves legitimate cause by clear and convincing evidence.

Retaliation constitutes constitutional malfeasance.



(j) Remedies

Whistleblowers subjected to retaliation are entitled to:
	1.	immediate injunctive relief;
	2.	reinstatement;
	3.	back pay with interest;
	4.	treble damages; and
	5.	reasonable attorney fees and costs.



(k) Classification Is No Defense

Classification shall not bar whistleblower protection, judicial review, or enforcement of constitutional rights.

Knowingly classifying information to conceal wrongdoing constitutes constitutional malfeasance.



(l) Accountability

Violation of this Section, including unlawful classification or retaliation, shall trigger mandatory referral under Section 6.



Section 10 — Oaths, Civil–Military Subordination, and Continuity

(a) Oath of Constitutional Fidelity

The President and all executive officers shall swear an oath to support and defend this Constitution.

The oath is a binding legal obligation, not a ceremonial act.



(b) Supremacy of Constitutional Duty

The duty to uphold this Constitution supersedes all other obligations, including:
	1.	loyalty to officeholders;
	2.	obedience to superior orders;
	3.	partisan allegiance; and
	4.	claims of necessity or expediency.

No order inconsistent with this Constitution is lawful.
