Article XLII-A — Communications Infrastructure and Civic Network Neutrality

Section 1. Purpose and Relationship to Article XLII

This Article governs the infrastructure, transmission, and technical conveyance of communications.
It exists to ensure that the freedom protected by Article XLII cannot be defeated through economic throttling, technical discrimination, or infrastructural capture.

Where conflict is alleged, Article XLII shall control as to expressive rights, and this Article shall control as to transport, access, and neutrality.

Section 2. Civic Communications Infrastructure

Communications infrastructure essential to civic participation—including wired, wireless, satellite, and successor technologies—shall be recognized as critical civic infrastructure, whether publicly or privately operated.

Such infrastructure shall be operated in a manner consistent with:
	1.	neutrality,
	2.	nondiscrimination,
	3.	transparency,
	4.	resilience,
	5.	universal access to the extent practicable.

Ownership structure shall not exempt compliance.

⸻

Section 3. Network Neutrality

No operator of communications infrastructure shall:
	1.	block, throttle, degrade, or prioritize lawful data traffic based on:
	•	content,
	•	source,
	•	destination,
	•	viewpoint,
	•	application type,
	•	or affiliation;
	2.	impose discriminatory pricing, latency, or access conditions that materially impair civic participation;
	3.	condition service quality on political, ideological, or commercial alignment.

Differential treatment is permitted only where:
	•	strictly necessary for network integrity,
	•	content-agnostic,
	•	narrowly tailored,
	•	and publicly disclosed.

⸻

Section 4. Measurement, Transparency, and Proof

Operators shall maintain objective, verifiable performance metrics, including latency, throughput, packet loss, and availability.

Where discrimination is alleged:
	1.	statistical disparity and technical evidence shall suffice to shift the burden of proof;
	2.	intent need not be shown where effect is substantial;
	3.	failure to disclose metrics creates a rebuttable presumption of violation.

⸻

Section 5. Economic Neutrality and Anti-Capture

No entity may:
	1.	use market dominance to impose de facto censorship through access degradation;
	2.	leverage infrastructure control to extract political, ideological, or behavioral concessions;
	3.	collude with public or private actors to suppress lawful communication indirectly.

Structural separation, common-carrier obligations, or access mandates may be imposed by law where necessary to prevent capture.

⸻

Section 6. Civic Access and Inclusion

The State shall ensure that communications infrastructure policy:
	1.	promotes universal civic access;
	2.	avoids exclusion by cost, geography, or artificial scarcity;
	3.	supports redundancy and decentralization;
	4.	preserves interoperability and open standards.

Nothing herein requires uniform pricing or forbids innovation, provided neutrality is preserved.

⸻

Section 7. Emergency and Security Exceptions

Temporary deviations from neutrality are permitted only where:
	1.	strictly necessary to preserve network integrity or public safety;
	2.	limited in duration and scope;
	3.	publicly documented;
	4.	subject to post-event judicial review.

Emergency powers shall not be used to suppress lawful expression or political communication.

⸻

Section 8. Enforcement and Remedies

Violations of this Article shall constitute a grave civic offense.

Remedies may include:
	1.	injunctive relief;
	2.	civil liability;
	3.	structural remedies;
	4.	loss of operating privileges;
	5.	criminal liability where willful and systemic.

Standing shall be broad, and no immunity shall attach by virtue of infrastructure ownership or regulatory delegation.

⸻

Section 9. Technological Neutrality

This Article applies to all present and future communications technologies, regardless of medium, protocol, or architecture.

Regulation shall be function-based, not platform-based, and shall adapt to technological evolution without undermining constitutional principles.

⸻

Section 10. Construction and Lock Scope

This Article shall be construed:
	•	to prevent infrastructural censorship by design,
	•	to preserve competition and innovation,
	•	to protect civic participation at scale.

The principles of neutrality, nondiscrimination, transparency, and universal civic access are structurally locked.
Operational mechanisms remain subject to legislative refinement consistent with this Constitution.

⸻

Section 11. Severability

If any provision of this Article is held invalid, the remainder shall remain in force.
