Article XXXVI-B — Subordinate Government Failure and Federal Stewardship Intervention

Section 1. Preconditions to Intervention

Federal stewardship intervention may occur only after:
	1.	a final judicial determination under Article XXXVI-A that a subordinate government has failed; and
	2.	a written order specifying the functions adjudged failed, the scope of remedy, and the duration.

No intervention may proceed by declaration, inference, or emergency pretext alone.

⸻

Section 2. Nature of Intervention

Intervention under this Article is stewardship, not governance.

Accordingly:
	1.	authority is temporary and functional, limited to the failed functions identified by the court;
	2.	sovereignty remains with the People and the lawful constitutional order;
	3.	all actions shall conform to Article XXVI (Rights Supremacy) and Article XXVIII (Federalism).

⸻

Section 3. Appointment of Stewards

Upon authorization, the Constitutional Review Court shall appoint, subject to appellate review by the Supreme Court to execute the limited remedial mandate.

Stewards shall:
	1.	be vetted for independence, competence, and absence of conflicts;
	2.	swear an oath to restore lawful self-governance and to exit upon satisfaction of benchmarks;
	3.	operate under continuing judicial supervision.

No steward may simultaneously hold partisan office or seek electoral advantage from stewardship.

⸻

Section 4. Scope of Authority

Stewards may exercise only those powers necessary to:
	1.	restore basic public safety and essential services;
	2.	secure finances and prevent further dissipation of public assets;
	3.	remediate rights violations adjudged under XXXVI-A;
	4.	reestablish lawful administrative capacity.

Stewards shall not:
	•	restructure political institutions beyond what is strictly necessary for lawful function;
	•	alter electoral rules except as ordered by the court to cure adjudicated defects;
	•	privatize public assets except where required to prevent imminent loss and approved by the court.

⸻

Section 5. Prohibitions

Intervention shall not be used to:
	1.	impose ideological programs or partisan agendas;
	2.	engineer demographic, cultural, or economic outcomes unrelated to remediation;
	3.	displace lawful private labor through coercion;
	4.	expand federal authority beyond the remedial mandate.

Collective punishment of residents is prohibited.

⸻

Section 6. Duration and Sunset

Every stewardship order shall include:
	1.	a fixed term not to exceed that necessary to accomplish the remedial objectives;
	2.	automatic sunset absent affirmative judicial renewal upon a showing of necessity;
	3.	periodic review at intervals prescribed by law.

Failure to meet renewal standards terminates the intervention.

⸻

Section 7. Restoration Benchmarks

At initiation, the court shall approve a Restoration Plan specifying:
	1.	objective benchmarks for capacity, legality, and rights compliance;
	2.	timelines for reconstitution of local authority;
	3.	conditions for elections, ratification, or reinstatement as appropriate.

Benchmarks shall be public and justiciable.

⸻

Section 8. Accountability

Stewards are subject to:
	1.	full transparency and public reporting;
	2.	independent audit;
	3.	civil and criminal liability for intentional or reckless misconduct;
	4.	removal by the court for cause.

No immunity attaches by virtue of stewardship.

⸻

Section 9. Coordination with Other Authorities

Nothing in this Article authorizes:
	•	military deployment, except as separately permitted under Article XXIV;
	•	emergency powers, except as separately invoked under Article XXXVIII;
	•	intelligence operations or coercive policing beyond lawful mandates.

Coordination, where necessary, shall remain subordinate to judicial orders herein.

⸻

Section 10. Exit and Handover

Upon satisfaction of restoration benchmarks:
	1.	stewardship authority shall cease automatically;
	2.	lawful local governance shall be fully restored;
	3.	all records shall be transferred to local custody;
	4.	a final public accounting shall be issued.

No residual federal control may persist.

⸻

Section 11. Construction

This Article shall be construed narrowly:
	•	to enable decisive remediation where adjudicated failure exists;
	•	to prevent permanence, pretext, or expansion;
	•	to favor the earliest lawful return to self-governance.

Failure warrants remedy; remedy does not justify rule.
