Article XX-C — Construction Corps
Charge
The Republic recognizes that genuine civic qualification requires real sacrifice and contribution, not administrative theater or credentialed shortcuts. The Construction Corps exists as a rigorous, labor-intensive pathway within the National Public Service Corps, ensuring that those who seek civic citizenship through public works earn it through direct, physically demanding effort that builds and sustains the common good. This Article guarantees the integrity of that pathway against dilution, substitution, displacement of private labor, or capture by managerial or political interests.
Section 1. Establishment and Purpose
The Republic may authorize a Construction Corps as a distinct operational arm of the National Public Service Corps. Its sole constitutional purpose is to execute physically demanding, field-based public works essential to national resilience, civic infrastructure, and long-term human flourishing, including but not limited to:
(a) construction, repair, and maintenance of roads, bridges, levees, drainage systems, waterworks, public buildings, and critical energy/transportation infrastructure;
(b) disaster recovery, debris removal, and environmental remediation under hazardous or austere conditions;
(c) other manual, labor-intensive projects that materially preserve or enhance the Republic’s physical and communal fabric.
Section 2. Nature of Service
Service in the Construction Corps shall consist primarily of direct manual labor and field execution. Credit toward civic citizenship or other constitutional recognition shall be granted only for:
(a) hands-on participation in physical construction, repair, maintenance, or recovery operations;
(b) work performed under real environmental exposure, physical risk, or sustained hardship consistent with the demands of essential public infrastructure.
Supervisory, administrative, planning, advisory, training, inspection, or symbolic roles shall not satisfy service requirements unless accompanied by substantial, documented direct labor participation.
Section 3. Integrity and Anti-Dilution Rules
No person may fulfill Construction Corps service obligations through:
(a) delegation, substitution, or proxy labor;
(b) monetary payment, purchase, or financial equivalence;
(c) credential-based waivers, academic credit, or administrative certification;
(d) nominal or ceremonial participation;
(e) reclassification of duties to reduce physical demand or exposure.
Any attempt to circumvent these requirements constitutes a grave offense against the Republic and the principle of earned civic status.
Section 4. Conditions of Service
The Corps shall operate under conditions that reflect the authentic demands of public works:
(a) reasonable occupational safety standards shall apply, but no person shall be insulated from physical effort, environmental exposure, or the ordinary risks inherent in essential infrastructure labor;
(b) work schedules, locations, and tasks shall not be adjusted to provide preferential or cushioned pathways to civic qualification;
(c) the Corps shall not be deployed in a manner that displaces or undercuts private labor through coercion, underbidding, or unfair competition.
Section 5. Oversight and Anti-Capture Safeguards
(a) The organization, scope, eligibility criteria, and operational standards of the Construction Corps shall be prescribed by statute, consistent with this Article, Article III (Citizenship and Civic Duty), and Article XX-A (National Public Service Corps).
(b) The Constitutional Judicial Commission (CJC) shall certify annually that the Corps maintains genuine hardship and labor intensity, and shall investigate any credible allegation of dilution, favoritism, or displacement.
(c) Any lawful resident shall have standing to challenge violations or degradation of Corps standards before the Constitutional Review Court (CRC), with expedited review and broad discovery rights.
Section 6. Construction and Lock Protection
This Article shall be interpreted to:
(a) preserve the Construction Corps as a rigorous, non-negotiable pathway to civic recognition through real sacrifice and contribution;
(b) prevent its transformation into an administrative, credentialed, or politically manipulated program;
(c) protect private labor markets from displacement while channeling public works toward national resilience and human flourishing.
The core principles of this Article—including the requirement of direct manual labor, prohibition on substitution or dilution, and safeguards against displacement and capture—are lock-protected under Article XV and may not be repealed, suspended, diluted, reinterpreted, or circumvented except through the supermajority procedures specified therein.
