ARTICLE XXV — Immigration, Residency, and Lawful Belonging
 Charge  This Article governs the authority of the Republic to regulate immigration, residency, asylum, and lawful belonging. A Republic is a sovereign community of shared rules, mutual obligation, and ordered liberty. Immigration policy shall serve the long-term flourishing, safety, and cohesion of the People while ensuring humane treatment, due process, and proportionality.  The Republic retains absolute sovereign authority to determine who may enter, reside, and belong. Compassion shall not become coercion, and generosity shall not become self-destruction. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to require open borders, mass regularization, demographic engineering, or the erosion of constitutional self-government.  Section 1. Sovereign Authority and Lawful Belonging  The Republic possesses inherent and exclusive authority to regulate entry, residency, asylum, and naturalization.  No person possesses an inherent right to enter, remain, or belong absent lawful authorization.  Admission, residency, and citizenship determinations shall be based on lawful conduct, character, compatibility with constitutional order, and the legitimate needs of the Republic, and shall not be based on race, ethnicity, or immutable characteristics.  Birthright citizenship shall apply only to children born to at least one parent who is a citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of birth. Birth on Republic soil alone shall not confer political sovereignty, voting rights, or eligibility for public office absent qualifying parental status or subsequent lawful naturalization.  Persons present unlawfully retain due process, humane treatment, and protection from violence, but shall not possess political rights, be counted for apportionment, or obtain lawful status through executive discretion, political amnesty, or duration alone.  Children born within the Republic to parents unlawfully present or on temporary status shall not be rendered stateless and shall retain all inviolable rights guaranteed by this Constitution.  Section 2. Compatibility, Character, and Exclusion for Hostility  The Republic shall favor admission or continued presence of individuals who demonstrate respect for the rule of law, peaceful coexistence, equality before the law, and willingness to contribute economically, civically, or socially.  The Republic may deny entry, residency, or continued presence to any individual who engages in or materially supports terrorism, organized crime, violent extremism, or coercive ideologies incompatible with constitutional supremacy, or who demonstrates a pattern of contempt for the rights or safety of others.  Exclusion or removal requires written notice, opportunity to contest evidence, and judicial review. Decisions shall be based on conduct and credible evidence, not protected belief or expression alone.  Section 3. Asylum, Refuge, and Humanitarian Protection  The Republic may grant asylum or humanitarian protection to individuals fleeing genuine persecution or grave injustice, provided the applicant demonstrates a well-founded fear, absence of serious criminal conduct, and willingness to abide by the laws of the Republic.  Asylum applications shall generally be made from the country of origin or a safe third country. Catch-and-release pending adjudication is prohibited except in extraordinary cases supported by clear and convincing evidence of immediate danger.  Humanitarian admission does not create an entitlement to permanent residence or citizenship.  No treaty, international body, or foreign authority may compel admission, retention, or naturalization contrary to this Constitution.  Humanitarian admissions may be suspended, limited, or conditioned by legislative supermajority when necessary to preserve public safety, social cohesion, or institutional capacity, subject to judicial review and automatic sunset.  Section 4. Lawful Residency Classes and Prohibition of Chain Migration  Residency classes shall be finite, transparent, and defined by statute, including temporary visitors, students, workers, humanitarian residents, permanent residents, and applicants for citizenship.  Family reunification shall be limited to spouses and minor dependent children. No extended chain migration beyond the nuclear family is permitted.  No residency status shall be indefinite by default. Individuals shall face clear, time-bound pathways to lawful permanence, lawful removal, or voluntary departure.  Section 5. Rectification Pathways and Prohibition of Mass Amnesty  Limited, individualized rectification pathways may be established for persons brought into the Republic as minors through no fault of their own, or for individuals demonstrating exceptional and verifiable contribution, sustained lawful conduct, and integration.  Rectification shall be administered by independent, non-partisan bodies, governed by objective statutory criteria, limited in annual scope, and subject to judicial review.  Mass regularization, blanket amnesty, or legalization based solely on duration, economic demand, or demographic necessity is prohibited.  Section 6. Work, Contribution, Taxation, and Public Burden  Lawful residents authorized to work shall enjoy equal protection under labor law and the right to seek lawful employment.  Employers shall not be compelled to hire unlawfully present persons nor penalized for compliance with lawful hiring standards.  Lawful workers shall be subject to taxation proportional to income and shall contribute to public systems from which they benefit.  Access to means-tested public benefits may be conditioned on lawful status, sustained contribution, and humanitarian necessity. Emergency medical care, protection of children, and basic humanitarian assistance necessary to preserve life and dignity shall not be denied.  The Republic shall not structure immigration or welfare systems to incentivize unlawful entry, dependency, or permanent non-contribution.  Section 7. Integration Expectations Without Coercion  Lawful residents are expected to obey the laws of the Republic, respect constitutional supremacy, refrain from coercive or segregative practices, permit their children access to qualifying education, and demonstrate basic proficiency in the Republic’s common language and civic principles.  Integration policies shall prioritize language acquisition, civic understanding, and economic participation without imposing ideological conformity, cultural erasure, or compelled belief.  No permanent resident underclass shall be created by design.  Section 8. Interpretation and Status  This Article shall be interpreted to preserve sovereign control over borders and membership, ensure humane treatment and due process, favor merit and integration over entitlement, and reject both open-borders idealism and xenophobic overreach.  Lock designations, if any, shall be determined pursuant to Article XV.
