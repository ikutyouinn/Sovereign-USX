Article XLIV — Transition, Ratification, and Constitutional Accession

1. Ratification and Supremacy

Upon lawful ratification, this Constitution shall be the supreme law of the Republic. All prior constitutions, charters, statutes, regulations, and executive acts inconsistent with this Constitution are superseded to the extent of the conflict.

No authority may delay, condition, or qualify constitutional supremacy beyond the procedures expressly stated herein.

⸻

2. Continuity of Law and Government

All laws, offices, courts, contracts, and institutions lawfully existing at the time of ratification shall continue temporarily insofar as they do not conflict with this Constitution and until duly conformed, replaced, or repealed under constitutional process.

Continuity shall not be construed to preserve unconstitutional power, immunity, monopoly, or privilege.

⸻

3. Immediate Effect Provisions

The following provisions take immediate effect upon ratification and are not subject to transitional delay:
	•	Supremacy and lock clauses
	•	Inviolable rights and prohibitions
	•	Anti-collusion and anti-capture rules
	•	Non-derogable constraints on emergency power
	•	Standing and access to courts for constitutional claims

Any act taken in violation of immediately effective provisions is void.

⸻

4. Transitional Conformance Period

All remaining institutions and laws shall be brought into compliance within a defined conformance period, to be prescribed by statute and not to exceed a limited duration.

During this period:
	•	No expansion of legacy power is permitted.
	•	No new exclusivities, immunities, or monopolies may be granted.
	•	Courts shall construe ambiguity against preservation of legacy authority and in favor of constitutional alignment.

Failure to conform within the conformance period renders the conflicting provision void.

⸻

5. Judicial Oversight During Transition

Courts shall have original and continuing jurisdiction to adjudicate transitional conflicts.

Where conflict exists:
	1.	constitutional text controls;
	2.	locks and non-derogable provisions control over transitional allowances;
	3.	rights-protective interpretations control over power-preserving ones.

No doctrine of deference, abstention, or political question shall bar review of transitional compliance.

⸻

6. Institutional Reconstitution

Where an existing institution is structurally incompatible with this Constitution and cannot be conformed without defeating constitutional purpose, it shall be reconstituted, replaced, or dissolved by lawful process.

Personnel continuity is not guaranteed where incompatible with constitutional duty.

⸻

7. Accession of Officials and Officers

All public officials shall, as a condition of continued service, affirm accession to this Constitution and acceptance of its supremacy, constraints, and enforcement.

Refusal or violation constitutes grounds for removal.

⸻

8. Protection Against Retroactive Abuse

Nothing in this Article authorizes:
	•	retroactive punishment absent due process,
	•	revival of expired exclusivities,
	•	reinstatement of powers expressly prohibited herein.

Transitional necessity shall not be used to re-create extinguished authority.

⸻

9. Construction and Lock Scope

This Article shall be construed to favor:
	•	constitutional supremacy,
	•	continuity without entrenchment,
	•	transition without capture,
	•	reform without chaos.

The principles governing ratification, supremacy, immediate effect, and non-derogability are structural and may not be suspended or amended except as expressly permitted by this Constitution.
