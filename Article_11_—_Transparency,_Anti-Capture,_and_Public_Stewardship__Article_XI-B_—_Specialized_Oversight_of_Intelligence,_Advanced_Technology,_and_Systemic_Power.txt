Article XI-B — Specialized Oversight of Intelligence, Advanced Technology, and Systemic Power

Section 1. Non-Derogation and Scope

This Article supplements Articles XI and XI-A.

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to narrow, delay, condition, excuse, or substitute for any duty, prohibition, liability, or remedy imposed by Articles XI or XI-A.

This Article exists to ensure that high-secrecy, high-complexity domains do not evade constitutional accountability.

⸻

Section 2. Covered Domains of Elevated Risk

The following domains are designated as elevated-risk sectors subject to specialized oversight:
	1.	intelligence and counterintelligence services;
	2.	surveillance, signals intelligence, and data fusion systems;
	3.	artificial intelligence and advanced computational systems;
	4.	cryptographic, cyber, and information warfare capabilities;
	5.	financial systems, clearing mechanisms, and capital infrastructure;
	6.	public–private programs operating under secrecy, classification, or technical opacity.

Designation under this Section does not confer immunity or exceptional status.

⸻

Section 3. Mandatory Specialized Inspectors

For each elevated-risk sector, one or more Specialized Inspectors shall be appointed within the Inspector General System.

Specialized Inspectors shall possess demonstrable technical competence sufficient to audit systems, not merely policies or reports.

Lack of expertise shall not excuse failure of oversight.

All nullifications, forfeitures, and disqualifications invoked by the DCEA shall be subject to confirmation by the Constitutional Review Court, and all claims of interference, capture, or retaliation against the DCEA shall fall under the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Judicial Commission.

⸻

Section 4. Full Access to Technical Systems

Specialized Inspectors shall have full access to:
	1.	technical architectures and system designs;
	2.	source code, models, and algorithms;
	3.	training data categories and pipelines;
	4.	operational logs and decision outputs;
	5.	internal risk assessments and failure analyses.

Claims of classification, proprietary interest, or national security shall not defeat access, and may only govern handling procedures.

⸻

Section 5. Prohibition on “Black Box” Governance

No system within an elevated-risk sector may operate as an unreviewable black box.

Where decisions materially affect rights, liberty, public resources, or democratic processes, intelligible explanation and auditability are mandatory.

Inaccessibility or incomprehensibility constitutes evidence of unconstitutional governance.

⸻

Section 6. Automatic Tier-3 Referral Triggers

The following findings shall trigger mandatory Tier-3 referral, without discretion:
	1.	concealment of programs, systems, or authorities from lawful oversight;
	2.	systemic manipulation of information, markets, or public perception;
	3.	retaliatory classification or secrecy used to suppress exposure;
	4.	delegation of sovereign or cognitive authority to unaccountable systems;
	5.	collusion between public authority and private power to evade constitutional limits.

Failure to refer under this Section constitutes independent misconduct.
All Tier-3 referral triggers under this Section shall be certified by the Constitutional Judicial Commission and immediately docketed for constitutional adjudication by the Constitutional Review Court.

⸻

Section 7. Intelligence and National Security Constraints

Intelligence and national security functions are subject to the Constitution in full.

No claim of national security may be used to:
	1.	override transparency obligations permanently;
	2.	shield unlawful conduct from referral;
	3.	evade judicial review;
	4.	suppress whistleblowers or inspectors.

Secrecy is a handling condition, not a jurisdictional shield.

⸻

Section 8. Financial and Technical Capture Prohibited

Coordination between intelligence, financial institutions, and advanced technology systems that results in hidden control, coercion, or manipulation of the public constitutes capture.

Such coordination shall be treated as systemic betrayal, regardless of formal legality.

⸻

Section 9. Continuous Audit and Stress Testing

Elevated-risk systems shall be subject to continuous audit, stress testing, and adversarial review sufficient to detect:
	1.	abuse of power;
	2.	drift beyond lawful scope;
	3.	emergent coercive effects;
	4.	systemic fragility or dependency.

Oversight shall be proactive, not reactive.

⸻

Section 10. Records, Classification, and Declassification

All records within elevated-risk sectors are subject to constitutional record-keeping obligations.

Classification shall be narrowly applied, periodically reviewed, and automatically expire absent renewed justification.

Permanent secrecy is prohibited.

⸻

Section 11. Whistleblower Priority and Protection

Disclosures relating to elevated-risk sectors shall receive priority handling.

Whistleblowers providing evidence of Tier-3 conduct shall receive maximum constitutional protection.

Retaliation in such cases constitutes compounding liability.

⸻

Section 12. Coordination with Courts and the Legislature

Specialized Inspectors shall coordinate with courts and legislative oversight bodies as required to enforce constitutional limits.

No branch may disclaim responsibility by pointing to another.

⸻

Section 13. Limits of Authority

Specialized Inspectors shall not:
	1.	authorize operations;
	2.	approve programs;
	3.	grant immunity;
	4.	suppress enforcement.

Their role is exposure, documentation, and mandatory escalation.

⸻

Section 14. Emergency Prohibition

No emergency, war, crisis, or continuity doctrine shall suspend or diminish the operation of this Article.

Periods of crisis heighten, rather than reduce, oversight obligations.

⸻

Section 15. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to ensure that secrecy, complexity, and technical sophistication do not become instruments of unaccountable power.

Where doubt exists, the construction that favors exposure, accountability, and constitutional supremacy shall control.

⸻

Section 16. Prohibition of Cognitive and Linguistic Manipulation

No public authority, regulated platform, contractor, media organ, or proxy may use control of information, language, or communication systems to distort, coerce, or manipulate public understanding for political, ideological, economic, or institutional advantage.

The following acts are prohibited:

(a) redefining words, categories, or concepts in order to mislead, coerce, or suppress lawful political, scientific, moral, or legal discourse;

(b) imposing mandatory ideological terminology or compelled linguistic frameworks that invert truth or force affirmation of disputed or false claims;

(c) requiring affirmation of false, distorted, or officially mandated definitions of reality under threat of penalty or disadvantage;

(d) algorithmically suppressing, amplifying, curating, or shaping speech for the purpose of manufacturing consent, narrative dominance, or political obedience;

(e) penalizing, de-platforming, debanking, demoting, or disadvantaging any person for using ordinary language to describe observable facts, good-faith belief, or dissenting views.

⸻

Section 16(b) — Institutional Capture

Any pattern or system of conduct under this Section constitutes institutional capture of public cognition and triggers all remedies, forfeitures, penalties, nullifications, and personal liabilities provided in Article XI and this Article.

⸻

Section 16(c) — Free Speech Preservation

Nothing in this Section restricts private belief, opinion, satire, or lawful disagreement.
This Section governs only the use of institutional power to distort reality, coerce expression, or control public meaning.

⸻

Section 16(d) — Construction and Lock Status

This Section shall be construed broadly against state-sponsored propaganda, semantic corruption, and ideological coercion, and narrowly in favor of free inquiry, truth-seeking, and individual sovereignty over language.

This Section is lock-protected pursuant to Article XV.
