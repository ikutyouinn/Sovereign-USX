Article IX-A — Indigenous and Tribal Corporate Land-Use Rights, Stewardship, and Non-Exclusion

Charge
This Article secures lawful Indigenous and tribal corporate land-use rights— including fishing, hunting, grazing, and farming— as instruments of heritage preservation, livelihood continuity, and local resilience, while enforcing one Constitution, one rule of law, and uniform civil rights for all lawful residents.
These protections shall not create caste, hereditary political privilege, dual citizenship, territorial apartheid, or exclusionary sovereignty. Rights herein operate through ordinary property, easement, stewardship, and environmental law, with strict due process and anti-capture safeguards.
(Cross-references: Article II; Article III; Article III-B; Article IX; Article 0; Article XV.)

Section 1. Definitions and Scope

(a) Tribal Corporate Entity.
“Tribal Corporate Entity” means an Indigenous nation, tribe, or recognized people organized as a corporate entity under national corporate law, as recognized and permitted under Article III-B.

(b) Covered Uses.
“Covered Uses” means: subsistence and customary fishing, hunting, grazing, farming, gathering, and related land-management practices, including seasonal and ceremonial uses where consistent with public safety and stewardship.

(c) Covered Lands.
“Covered Lands” means:
(1) Tribal corporate lands held in fee, corporate title, trust-converted title, or other lawful corporate ownership form recognized under Article III-B and national property law; and
(2) Designated co-managed public lands subject to Section 3 of this Article.

(d) No Political Authority by Land-Use Right.
No land-use right recognized herein confers political authority, suffrage, office eligibility, or Civic Standing. Political authority is governed exclusively by Article III.

(e) Uniform Civil Rights.
All lawful residents retain equal civil rights under Article II. Nothing herein shall diminish civil rights, equal protection, due process, or access to courts.

Section 2. Tribal Corporate Land-Use Rights on Tribal Corporate Lands

(a) Baseline Rights.
On tribal corporate lands, Tribal Corporate Entities and their lawful beneficiaries may:
(1) fish, hunt, graze, and farm for subsistence, commerce, cultural continuity, or stewardship purposes;
(2) regulate ordinary access as a property holder may, consistent with Article II and Section 6 of this Article; and
(3) implement internal land-use rules that are viewpoint-neutral, non-discriminatory as to civil rights, and consistent with this Constitution.

(b) Public Safety and General Law.
Covered Uses remain subject to general criminal law, public safety law, and conservation law applicable to all persons, provided such law is:
(1) generally applicable and non-discriminatory;
(2) based on clear, site-specific evidence where it restricts customary practice;
(3) narrowly tailored to prevent imminent and specific harm; and
(4) subject to judicial review with due process.

(c) Stewardship Obligations.
Tribal corporate lands are subject to the same duty of stewardship as all lands under Article IX, including prohibitions on neglect, waste, soil depletion, and predatory exploitation, and the same protections against abusive enforcement.
Stewardship enforcement must respect Article II due process and takings protections.

Section 3. Co-Managed Public Lands and Priority-Use Framework

(a) Designation by Law; No Blanket Carve-Outs.
Law may designate specific public lands, waters, or ranges as co-managed areas where covered Indigenous customary use historically occurred, provided designation:
(1) is site-specific and publicly mapped;
(2) includes written findings of historic nexus and practical necessity;
(3) preserves one Constitution and one judiciary; and
(4) does not create exclusive sovereign territory.

(b) Priority Use Without Exclusion.
Within designated co-managed areas, law may grant Tribal Corporate Entities and their lawful beneficiaries a priority-use framework for Covered Uses, meaning:
(1) priority seasonal windows;
(2) priority allotments within sustainable limits; and/or
(3) priority access to permits where a permit system is constitutionally valid.
Priority use shall not constitute blanket exclusion of other lawful residents unless exclusion is necessary to prevent imminent and specific harm and is ordered by a court using the least restrictive means.

(c) Non-Discrimination and Equal Baseline Access.
All lawful residents may access public lands under general law. Priority-use frameworks must:
(1) remain viewpoint-neutral and not function as demographic engineering;
(2) preserve baseline access for non-tribal persons subject to stewardship;
(3) prohibit exclusive monopolization of public resources; and
(4) remain reviewable and adjustable to avoid ecological harm.

(d) Conservation Standard.
No restriction on general public access, and no allocation of exclusive priority beyond narrow windows or allotments, shall occur absent clear and convincing evidence that the restriction is necessary to prevent imminent and specific harm that cannot be mitigated by narrower means.

Section 4. Grazing and Range Rights Integration

(a) Harmonization with Article IX.
Where Article IX recognizes public grazing and commons use, Tribal Corporate Entities may participate in that commons under the same anti-capture principles and stewardship standards, and may also receive limited priority-use within co-managed areas under Section 3.

(b) No Exclusive Leasing Regime.
No priority-use framework may be implemented through discretionary permits or exclusive leases that function as barriers to access, entrench incumbent power, or suppress small-scale subsistence use, whether tribal or non-tribal.

(c) Evidence-Based Limits.
Where grazing practice causes material harm, the government bears the burden of demonstrating, by clear and site-specific evidence, that harm cannot be mitigated by reasonable, narrowly tailored conditions.

Section 5. Farming, Gathering, and Stewardship Easements

(a) Productive Use Encouraged.
Tribal Corporate Entities may farm, gather, and cultivate in ways consistent with long-term soil and watershed health, consistent with Article IX stewardship standards.

(b) Stewardship Easements.
Law may recognize stewardship easements on tribal corporate lands and co-managed areas to protect archeological sites, sacred sites, watershed corridors, wildlife corridors, and soil health, provided easements:
(1) are specific and recorded;
(2) impose the least restrictive means;
(3) include notice and opportunity to contest; and
(4) allow reasonable traditional use consistent with protection.

(c) Reciprocal Access Corridors.
Where feasible and safe, law should favor reciprocal access corridors (trails, right-of-way, waterways passage) that preserve general movement and continuity without forcing entry into culturally sensitive sites.

Section 6. Non-Exclusion, Anti-Caste, and Civil Rights Safeguards

(a) No Racial or Blood-Quantum Caste.
No law, policy, or corporate rule may create a racially segregated paradise, caste hierarchy, or hereditary civil-rights class. Civil rights remain uniform under Article II.

(b) Access Control Limited to Property and Cultural Sensitivity.
Tribal Corporate Entities may restrict entry to tribal corporate lands for the same reasons other private owners may, including prevention of crime and protection of sensitive rituals, sacred sites, or internal corporate meetings, provided restrictions:
(1) do not deny emergency access, lawful warrants, or due process;
(2) do not operate as public-accommodation discrimination where public accommodation law constitutionally applies; and
(3) do not convert public lands into exclusionary territory.

(c) No Dual Citizenship; No Separate Sovereignty.
Nothing in this Article creates dual citizenship, independent criminal or civil jurisdiction, or exemption from constitutional law, consistent with Article III-B.

(d) No Political Exclusion.
No priority-use framework under this Article may be conditioned on political belief, party affiliation, ideology, compelled speech, or compelled cultural assent.

(e) No Independent Police Power.
Nothing in this Article or in any tribal corporate charter shall be construed to grant any independent police power, power of arrest, detention authority, or criminal jurisdiction to any tribal entity or tribal corporate entity.
Trespass and other violations shall be addressed through ordinary civil remedies and through the constitutional judiciary and Republic law enforcement under general law, with full due process.
Private security may observe, document, and request departure, and may use only the same narrowly limited defensive force available to any private person under general law.
(f) Local Law Enforcement Permitted; Uniform Judiciary Required.
Nothing in this Article prohibits the formation of ordinary municipal, county, or state law-enforcement agencies that may be locally staffed, including predominantly by members of a tribe, provided such agencies operate under the unified constitutional criminal code, procedure, and judiciary of the Republic.
No law-enforcement body may claim separate sovereign criminal jurisdiction or submit cases to a parallel court system.

Section 7. Recordation, Transparency, and Anti-Predation

(a) Recordation of Designations and Rights.
All co-managed designations, priority windows, allotments, stewardship easements, and access corridors must be publicly recorded and mapped, with narrowly tailored redaction only for protection of sensitive archeological and sacred site locations.

(b) Anti-Predatory Encumbrance.
No contract, lease, bond, derivative, concession, management agreement, or financial instrument may encumber tribal land-use rights or co-managed priority rights in a manner that transfers effective control to non-tribal parties, extracts profit streams without fair market compensation, or engineers default to seize assets. Such instruments are void.

(c) Beneficiary Protection.
Where revenues or resource benefits flow from covered uses, governance shall operate for the benefit of lawful beneficiaries, with judicially auditable records sufficient to detect private enrichment or diversion.

Section 8. Enforcement and Remedies

(a) Standing.
Standing shall be construed broadly to include Tribal Corporate Entities, lawful beneficiaries, neighboring communities, downstream users, and civic organizations where demonstrable harm exists, consistent with Article IX.

(b) Judicial Forum and Due Process.
All disputes under this Article are subject to the constitutional judiciary. No separate or parallel court system is created. Injunctions, damages, restitution, and takings remedies remain available under Article II.

(c) Strict Scrutiny of Discriminatory Targeting.
Discriminatory taxation, special fees, licensing schemes, zoning, or indirect economic strangulation targeting tribal corporate covered uses are prohibited and shall be treated as unconstitutional takings and equal-protection violations, requiring full restitution and damages.

Section 9. Construction

(a) Against Exclusionary Sovereignty.
Ambiguities shall be resolved against the creation of caste, territorial apartheid, dual citizenship, or exclusionary sovereignty.

(b) In Favor of Stewardship and Equal Civil Rights.
Ambiguities shall be resolved in favor of stewardship, ecological responsibility, and equal civil rights under Article II, while preserving the practical ability of Indigenous communities to maintain customary covered uses and cultural continuity.

Section 10. Lock Designation

Pursuant to Article XV, this Article is designated as LOCK-PROTECTED.
No amendment, statute, executive action, judicial doctrine, or emergency declaration may dilute, suspend, reinterpret, or circumvent the non-exclusion safeguards, stewardship requirements, or due-process protections herein except through the highest procedural threshold and certification of non-diminishment.
