Article XXVI-A — Subsistence, Stewardship, and Animal Keeping

Charge:
The purpose of this Article is to secure the fundamental right of individuals and communities to provide food, sustenance, and livelihood through decentralized, small-scale, and non-industrial use of land, plants, and animals.

This Article establishes a constitutional presumption in favor of subsistence, self-sufficiency, and humane stewardship and against economic enclosure, forced dependency, or regulatory structures that privilege centralized or industrial producers over individuals.

All regulations affecting food production, animal keeping, and subsistence activity shall be construed narrowly and shall place the burden of proof on the government to justify any restriction.

⸻

1. Right to Keep Animals

All persons have the right to keep, raise, breed, care for, humanely slaughter, process, and utilize animals of any kind for companionship, work, husbandry, conservation, subsistence, livelihood, barter, or local exchange.

This right extends to small-scale commercial or direct-to-consumer activity conducted within the Republic, provided such activity is not industrial in scale and does not involve interstate or foreign commerce.

This right shall not be infringed unless the government demonstrates, by clear, specific, and individualized evidence, that the keeping of a particular animal or practice poses a substantial and non-speculative risk to human safety or the environment that cannot be mitigated by reasonable, narrowly tailored regulation.

⸻

2. Burden of Proof

The burden of proof rests entirely on the government.

The following shall be insufficient grounds for restriction:
	•	generalized fear or moral disapproval;
	•	aesthetic preference or neighborhood sentiment;
	•	breed, species, or class-based presumptions;
	•	speculative nuisance or unproven ecological models;
	•	commercial competition or protection of centralized markets.

Evidence must be individualized to the keeper’s actual practices and conditions, and shall not rely on species, breed, historical misuse, generalized models, or categorical assumptions.

⸻

3. Right to Raise Food

All persons have the right to grow, raise, harvest, process, and store food for personal, household, community, or local use, including plants, fungi, insects, fish, and animals, including within cities or densely populated areas.

This right shall not be restricted except where the government proves that a specific practice, as conducted, poses a demonstrable threat to public health or safety that cannot be addressed through narrowly tailored measures.

Zoning, density, or land-use rules shall not operate as de facto prohibitions.

⸻

4. Limits on Prohibition and Taxation

No prohibition, fee, license, tax, or inspection regime shall be imposed on subsistence-level animal keeping or food production in a manner that:
	•	functions as a practical ban;
	•	imposes costs disproportionate to risk;
	•	favors industrial or centralized producers;
	•	conditions the exercise of this right on discretionary approval.

Reasonable regulation may address sanitation, disease control, humane treatment, and genuine environmental protection, but shall not suppress self-sufficiency or decentralization. 
Routine or warrantless inspection of subsistence or small-scale animal keeping is prohibited absent probable cause or a specific, credible complaint.


⸻

5. Stewardship and Voluntary Commons

Stewardship under this Article includes voluntary individual or communal arrangements for grazing, conservation, breeding, or land enrichment, provided such arrangements respect individual rights and are entered without coercion.

Nothing in this Article authorizes compulsory collectivization or state control of animals or land under the guise of stewardship.

⸻

6. Construction, Supremacy, and Lock

This Article shall be construed broadly in favor of subsistence, self-sufficiency, humane stewardship, and personal autonomy, and narrowly against categorical bans, bureaucratic obstruction, or economic enclosure.

The rights secured herein are fundamental and non-derogable, and may not be suspended by emergency, zoning ordinance, administrative convenience, economic policy, or market preference.
