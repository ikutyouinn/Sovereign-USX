Article XL — Energy, Abundance, and National Resilience

Charge — Article XL: Energy, Abundance, and National Resilience

The modern energy system is a grotesque monument to state capture, cronyism, and deliberate scarcity—a sclerotic regime that feeds on subsidies, smothers innovation with red tape, and condemns the People to high prices, fragility, and dependence. What should be abundant and inexpensive has been rendered artificial and costly by the very governments that claim to protect the public interest.

As Thomas Sowell observed, “The first lesson of economics is scarcity: there is never enough of anything to satisfy all those who want it. The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics.” Modern energy policy exemplifies this error. Real scarcity is ignored while artificial scarcity is imposed—through subsidies that pick winners, regulations that strangle competitors, and emergency powers that entrench failure. Energy poverty is repackaged as virtue; dependence is sold as security.

Ron Paul stated the principle plainly: “The government shouldn’t be in the business of subsidizing any form of energy.” Yet today, vast public resources flow to favored interests—legacy producers, ideological programs, and politically connected intermediaries—while genuine innovators are buried beneath permitting delays, mandates, and compliance mazes. This is not a free market. It is mercantilism under a moral pretext: socialism for the connected, austerity for the public.

Engineers of abundance remind us that reality, not bureaucracy, produces power. As Elon Musk has remarked, the greatest energy source already exists at planetary scale, and progress comes from harnessing what works—not from chasing prestige projects, subsidized illusions, or administratively designed outcomes. Abundance is achieved by aligning with physics, economics, and evidence—not by decree.

Javier Milei has warned of the tools by which states come to dominate society: “With tools such as printing money, debt, subsidies, price controls, and regulations to correct so-called market failures, they can control the lives and fates of millions of individuals.” Energy policy has become one of the most potent of these instruments—used to redistribute wealth upward, enforce dependence downward, and cloak control in the language of necessity.

This Republic rejects the empire of enforced scarcity. It rejects subsidies, mandates, regulatory cartels, and emergency pretexts that convert the lifeblood of civilization into a lever of coercion. Energy abundance is not a luxury; it is the natural outcome of liberty, innovation, competition, and evidence. Anything less is a betrayal of the People and a surrender to administrative rule.

Accordingly, this Article stands as a bulwark: private initiative first; technology neutrality absolute; subsidies forbidden; regulatory obstruction dismantled; and civilization-scale breakthroughs encouraged through voluntary incentives alone. Let markets, not mandarins, deliver the power that sustains freedom. No more excuses. No more chains.

Energy abundance—or decline.


Section 1. Principle of Energy Abundance
 🔒
The Republic recognizes access to reliable, affordable, and sufficient energy as a foundational condition of economic vitality, public welfare, and national security.

Public policy shall favor energy abundance over enforced scarcity, except where temporary restraint is demonstrably necessary to prevent material harm, catastrophic failure, or system collapse.

Energy scarcity imposed by design, ideology, administrative convenience, or regulatory obstruction is forbidden.

Section 2. Primacy of Private Initiative
The production, innovation, ownership, and distribution of energy shall, as a default rule, be open to private individuals, cooperatives, and enterprises operating lawfully within the Republic.

Private energy generation—including decentralized, off-grid, experimental, and self-provisioned systems—is presumptively lawful.

The State shall not monopolize energy production, control pricing or allocation, suppress private innovation, or restrict lawful energy development absent clear and convincing evidence of material harm or systemic risk.

Section 3. Technology Neutrality and Deregulatory Mandate
 🔒
Energy policy shall be:

a. technology-neutral;
b. grounded in empirical evidence, reproducible analysis, and transparent risk assessment;
c. open to continuous innovation, improvement, and replacement.

No energy source—solar, nuclear, fossil, geothermal, synthetic, or novel—shall be prohibited, penalized, subsidized, or favored by ideology, asserted consensus, or political narrative.

Regulatory barriers that materially obstruct private energy development, deployment, or modernization shall be removed unless the State demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that such barriers are necessary to prevent concrete harm.

Section 4. Limited Public Works Authority (Exceptional and Temporary)

Where private provision is demonstrably incapable of meeting essential national needs due to scale, security, or catastrophic vulnerability—and where deregulation alone is insufficient—the Republic may act directly as a measure of last resort.

Any public construction or operation of energy infrastructure shall require:

a. express statutory authorization;
b. written findings of demonstrated necessity;
c. full transparency and audit;
d. automatic sunset not exceeding five (5) years, absent supermajority renewal.

Public energy works shall not crowd out private enterprise, entrench obsolete systems, or persist once private provision becomes feasible.

Section 5. Corps of Engineers and Critical Infrastructure

Congress may authorize the Corps of Engineers or successor public works bodies to design or construct energy infrastructure only where:

a. national defense, disaster resilience, or grid survival so require;
b. failure to act would impose unacceptable risk to life or sovereignty;
c. private actors cannot reasonably perform the work in time or at scale.

Such authority shall be strictly limited, temporary, and shall not include pricing control, permanent operation, or market exclusion.

Section 6. Environmental and Human Balance

Energy development shall be governed consistently with:

a. Article IX (Land, Homesteading, and Agricultural Duty);
b. Article XXXVII (Environmental and Ecological Stewardship);
c. Article VIII (Economic Structure and Stewardship).

Environmental protection shall be evidence-based and proportional, and shall not serve as a pretext for energy deprivation, permanent austerity, or indirect control of the population.

Section 7. Austerity and Emergency Limitations
 🔒

Energy rationing, compulsory reduction, or enforced austerity may occur only where:

a. material scarcity or imminent system collapse is demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence;
b. measures are temporary, narrowly tailored, and judicially reviewable;
c. no less restrictive alternative can reasonably achieve the same protection.

Permanent emergency framing of energy governance is prohibited.

Section 8. Breakthrough Energy: Incentives, Disclosure, and Sunset

Where a method of energy generation is demonstrated to be civilization-scale in impact—capable of materially eliminating energy scarcity through abundance—the Republic shall encourage its disclosure and deployment through voluntary incentives rather than compulsion.

Congress may provide for statutory frameworks that:

a. offer substantial prizes, bounties, or guaranteed public procurement contracts for disclosure and deployment;
b. encourage voluntary licensing on fair and reasonable terms;
c. protect inventors against suppression, sabotage, or foreign capture.

Any such framework shall be evidence-based, non-punitive, and non-coercive, and may include:

d. optional shortened periods of exclusive rights;
e. optional post-recoupment licensing incentives, triggered only after demonstrable recovery of development costs and reasonable profit;
f. eventual public-domain release after defined temporal or economic thresholds, where continued exclusivity no longer serves innovation or public benefit.

No individual or entity shall be compelled to deploy, license, or surrender energy technology absent voluntary agreement or judicial finding of fraud, suppression, or unlawful restraint of trade.

Section 9. Anti-Subsidy and Anti-Cronyism Rule
 🔒

No subsidies, tax preferences, loan guarantees, or preferential financing shall be granted to any energy source or producer.

Public funds may be used only for neutral prizes, open procurement, or temporary public works authorized under Sections 4 or 5.

Cronyism, capture, and artificial market distortion are forbidden.

Section 10. Construction

This Article shall be interpreted to:

a. favor abundance, resilience, and innovation over scarcity and stagnation;
b. preserve maximum private liberty consistent with national survival;
c. reject ideological or technocratic capture of energy policy;
d. bind the State to the same standards of evidence, proportionality, and restraint imposed upon the People;
e. permit any person or enterprise with standing to challenge regulatory obstruction, unreasonable delay, or denial of lawful energy development as a form of artificial scarcity, subject to evidentiary standards and judicial review consistent with this Constitution.

Pursuant to Article XV, the following provisions of Article XL — Energy, Abundance, and National Resilience are hereby designated Lock-Protected Provisions.
