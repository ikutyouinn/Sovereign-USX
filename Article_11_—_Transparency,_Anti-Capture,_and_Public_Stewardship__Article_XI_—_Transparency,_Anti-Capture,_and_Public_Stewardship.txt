Article XI — Transparency, Anti-Capture, and Public Stewardship
Charge
This Article establishes mandatory requirements for transparency, public access to government records, institutional integrity, and the prevention of capture or corruption within the Republic. All provisions of this Article shall be construed to favor disclosure, accountability, and public oversight, subject only to narrowly defined and judicially reviewable exceptions expressly provided by law. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to authorize secrecy, classification, or institutional insulation for the purpose of concealing illegality, abuse of authority, or conflicts of interest.



Section 1. Principle of Public Stewardship

a. Public Office as Trust
All public offices, authorities, commissions, and agencies exist solely to serve the People and the Constitution.
Authority is a trust, not an entitlement.

b. Universal Applicability
This Article binds:
	•	all branches of government;
	•	all agencies and instrumentalities;
	•	all contractors and grantees acting under color of law;
	•	all public–private partnerships;
	•	all entities exercising delegated public authority.

No delegation may evade accountability.

c. Self-Executing Duty
The duties, obligations, and prohibitions set forth in this Section are self-executing and judicially enforceable.
No implementing legislation shall be required for their effect, and no branch of government may delay, suspend, or condition their enforcement.

d. Fiduciary Standard
All holders of public authority owe a fiduciary duty of loyalty, care, and candor to the People and the Constitution.
Any act undertaken for private benefit, institutional self-preservation, factional interest, or concealed influence constitutes a breach of that duty.

e. Presumption Against Unaccountable Power
The exercise of public authority is presumed illegitimate where it is concealed, unreviewable, or insulated from accountability.
The burden rests upon the holder of power to demonstrate lawful authority, constitutional purpose, and public justification.

f. Non-Delegation of Trust
Public fiduciary duties may not be transferred, diluted, or avoided through delegation, privatization, contractual arrangement, or intergovernmental compact.
Any entity exercising public authority assumes the same fiduciary obligations and liabilities as the delegating authority.
g. Nullification
Federal retaliation against a State for lawful nullification constitutes constitutional overreach per se, regardless of intent, motive, or asserted public benefit.


Section 2. Radical Transparency and Public Access

a. Default to Disclosure
All government records, communications, contracts, directives, audits, datasets, votes, debates, deliberations, committee proceedings, draft policymaking sessions, and pre-decisional meetings are public by default.

Secrecy requires justification; openness does not.

b. Limited Exceptions
Information may be withheld only where disclosure would cause:
	•	imminent and concrete national security harm;
	•	exposure of active intelligence sources or methods;
	•	violation of individual privacy narrowly defined;
	•	interference with an active criminal investigation.

All exceptions require written justification, defined duration, judicial review, and automatic expiration.

c. Constitutional Right to Information
Access to public information is a constitutional right.
No statute, regulation, or policy may abridge it.

d. Continuous Disclosure
The duty of disclosure is ongoing.
Public officials, agencies, and entities subject to this Article shall continuously update public records to reflect material changes in policy development, funding sources, communications, affiliations, financial interests, and delegated authority.

Stale, incomplete, or selectively updated disclosures constitute constructive concealment.

e. Financial Transparency of Public Authority
Any individual exercising public authority shall maintain publicly accessible disclosure of:
	•	assets and liabilities;
	•	income streams and compensation of any kind;
	•	beneficial ownership interests;
	•	gifts, trusts, deferred benefits, or contingent interests;
	•	material financial interests of immediate household members.

Disclosures shall be sufficient to permit independent verification of lawful income and absence of illicit enrichment.

f. Auditability and Citizen Review
All disclosed records shall be maintained in auditable form.
Any citizen may petition for independent review where disclosures indicate inconsistency, unexplained enrichment, concealment, or conflict of interest.

Frivolous petitions may be sanctioned; credible petitions require review.

g. Prohibition on Delay and Abuse of Classification
No record may be withheld, delayed, or redacted on the sole basis that it is pre-decisional, deliberative, advisory, or subject to internal review.

Classification or withholding shall not be renewed or reissued to evade disclosure requirements.
Serial or rolling secrecy claims constitute abuse of authority.

h. Transparency of Influence
Any person or entity seeking to influence public policy, regulation, enforcement, procurement, or election outcomes shall disclose:
	•	true beneficial funding sources;
	•	intermediaries or pass-through entities;
	•	foreign affiliations or support;
	•	coordinated advocacy relationships.

Disclosure obligations apply regardless of organizational form, nonprofit status, or jurisdiction.

i. Constitutional Supremacy
The rights and duties established in this Section supersede all statutory, regulatory, contractual, and administrative secrecy regimes to the extent of any conflict.
No law or agreement may narrow the scope of disclosure required herein.

Section 3. Anti-Capture Doctrine and Dark Money Prohibition

a. Definition of Capture
Institutional capture occurs when a public body acts primarily in the interest of regulated entities, donors, contractors, political patrons, ideological sponsors, or foreign interests rather than the People and the Constitution.

b. Prohibition
Capture in any form is unconstitutional.

c. Dark Money Prohibited
All political spending, advocacy funding, and influence campaigns intended to affect public policy or elections must disclose true beneficial sources.
Undisclosed, laundered, or proxy funding is illegal.

d. Objective Determination of Capture
Institutional capture shall be determined by objective indicators, including but not limited to:
	•	regulatory outcomes that consistently favor a narrow set of private interests;
	•	revolving employment or compensation patterns between regulators and regulated entities;
	•	disproportionate access, influence, or consultation by donors, contractors, or sponsors;
	•	unexplained policy deviations from empirical evidence or statutory mandate;
	•	suppression, distortion, or selective disclosure of information benefiting regulated parties;
	•	financial enrichment of officials correlated with official action.

Proof of intent, corruption, or personal gain shall not be required where capture is established by effect.

e. Strict Constitutional Liability
Institutional capture constitutes a strict constitutional violation.
Liability shall attach upon establishment of capture, regardless of motive, justification, or asserted necessity.

f. Forfeiture and Nullification
Any contract, regulation, subsidy, license, immunity, or advantage obtained through institutional capture is void ab initio.
All financial gains traceable to captured action are subject to forfeiture, disgorgement, and clawback.

g. Structural Ban on Concealed Influence
Any organizational, financial, or legal structure designed or used to obscure the true source of political influence is unconstitutional.
Nonprofit status, charitable designation, advocacy purpose, or foreign incorporation shall not exempt any entity from disclosure.

h. True Beneficial Ownership Required
Disclosure obligations require identification of natural persons who exercise ultimate control or enjoy ultimate benefit.
Nominees, trustees, shell entities, and layered ownership shall not satisfy disclosure requirements.

i. Continuing Constitutional Violation
Institutional capture constitutes a continuing violation for so long as its effects persist.
No limitations period shall bar enforcement while captured conditions remain operative.

j. Mandatory Remediation
Upon a finding of institutional capture, the following remedies are mandatory:
	•	dissolution or restructuring of the captured body or program;
	•	removal and permanent disqualification of responsible officials;
	•	termination of tainted contracts and privileges;
	•	referral for criminal prosecution where applicable.

No authority may decline remediation on grounds of convenience, stability, or economic impact.
k. Institutional Integrity Review
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing, independent authority, and mandatory jurisdiction to investigate, certify, and refer institutional capture under this Section.

A certification of capture by the CJC shall require immediate review and remedial jurisdiction by the Constitutional Review Court.


Section 4. Revolving Door, Conflicts of Interest, and Scope Creep

a. Cooling-Off Periods
No public official may accept employment, compensation, or advisory roles from entities they regulated or materially influenced for ten (10) years.

b. Asset Disclosure
Senior officials shall disclose assets, debts, income streams, gifts, and affiliations.
False disclosure is a grave offense.

c. Anti-Bureaucratic Expansion
No agency may expand its authority, scope, staffing, or budget beyond explicit legal authorization.

d. Senior Fiduciary Offices
The Legislature shall designate categories of senior public office whose occupants exercise extraordinary authority over law, finance, security, or coercive power.
Holders of such offices are subject to heightened fiduciary obligations and restrictions consistent with the unique risk of institutional capture.

e. Permanent Economic Separation for Senior Fiduciaries
The Legislature may require that holders of designated senior fiduciary offices accept permanent economic separation from private interests as a condition of service.

Such separation may include:
	•	exclusive reliance on a fixed public pension;
	•	prohibition on private employment, compensation, investment, dividends, or business income for life;
	•	mandatory divestment or transfer of assets into blind or public trusts.

Acceptance of such office constitutes informed and voluntary consent to these conditions.

f. Post-Service Corruption as a Grave Offense
Any knowing violation of post-service restrictions imposed under this Section constitutes a grave offense against the Republic.
Such violations shall carry mandatory imprisonment, forfeiture of pension and benefits, and permanent disqualification from public trust, as defined by law.

g. Presumptive Conflict and Disqualification
Where a public official maintains material financial, professional, familial, or ideological ties to an affected interest, a conflict of interest is presumed.
The official shall be disqualified from related action unless the conflict is affirmatively rebutted through transparent disclosure and independent review.

h. Unauthorized Expansion as Breach of Trust
Any expansion of authority, jurisdiction, staffing, budget, or operational scope beyond explicit legal authorization constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty.
Emergency or implied powers shall be construed narrowly and expire automatically absent ratification.

i. Mandatory Sunset for Independent Authority
Independent agencies, commissions, and regulatory bodies exercising coercive or rulemaking power shall be subject to periodic sunset and reauthorization by the Legislature.
Failure to reauthorize results in automatic dissolution or reversion of authority.
j. Legislative Obstruction and Filibuster Integrity

The right of extended debate exists to protect minority deliberation, not to enable silent veto, procedural paralysis, or minority rule.

A filibuster shall be valid only if all of the following conditions are met:

(1) Continuous Presence and Speech
The filibuster consists of continuous, in-person, audible speech by one or more members of the legislative body, physically present on the floor.

(2) Germane Content
All speech shall remain germane to the specific measure under debate.
Reading unrelated material, performing theatrics, or engaging in evasion of subject matter terminates the filibuster.

(3) No Proxy or Automation
No prerecorded, automated, delegated, symbolic, or proxy speech may sustain a filibuster.

(4) Quorum of Obstruction
A filibuster exists only while a quorum of filibustering members remains continuously present and speaking. Loss of such quorum immediately ends the filibuster.

(5) Exhaustion Rule
No filibuster may delay a vote on any measure for more than seventy-two (72) cumulative hours.
Upon exhaustion of this limit, a final vote shall occur automatically and without further obstruction.

(6) Political Accountability
Participation in a filibuster shall be publicly recorded, logged, and attributed to each participating member as formal obstruction of the measure.

No member may obstruct legislation without full and permanent political accountability to the People.

(7) Prohibition of Zombie Filibusters
No measure shall be blocked, delayed, or prevented by:
• refusal to invoke cloture;
• failure to schedule;
• procedural holds;
• silent objections;
• or any method that avoids open debate.

All legislative opposition must occur on the floor, in the open, and in speech.

(8) Judicial Enforcement
Any paralysis of legislative action caused by violation of this Section is justiciable.
Courts shall order immediate compliance and require a final vote where obstruction is unlawful.

(9) Construction
This Section shall be construed narrowly against indefinite minority vetoes and procedural abuse, and broadly in favor of deliberation, accountability, and the People’s right to governance.


Section 5. Contractors, NGOs, and Proxy Governance

a. No Shadow Government
Core governance, enforcement, or coercive authority may not be outsourced to NGOs, foundations, private firms, or international bodies except for limited, supervised functions defined by law.

b. Transparency of Proxies
Any non-governmental entity exercising public authority must disclose funding sources and foreign ties and submit to audit.

c. Ideological Laundering Prohibited
Government shall not do indirectly what it is forbidden to do directly.

d. Functional Determination of Public Authority
Any person or entity shall be deemed to exercise public authority where it:
	•	drafts, enforces, or materially influences public policy, regulation, or law;
	•	administers public funds, benefits, penalties, or enforcement programs;
	•	performs surveillance, data aggregation, or information control on behalf of the state;
	•	exercises coercive, punitive, or licensing power;
	•	substitutes for a public agency in practice, regardless of formal designation.

Formal private status shall not defeat constitutional accountability.

e. Accountability Parity
Any entity exercising public authority is subject to the same constitutional duties, transparency requirements, fiduciary obligations, and liabilities as a public agency.
No lesser standard shall apply by virtue of organizational form or contractual distance.

f. Absolute Anti-Circumvention Rule
No branch, agency, or official may accomplish indirectly through a proxy what it is constitutionally forbidden to do directly.
Any act so undertaken is void ab initio and constitutes a breach of public trust.

g. Foreign Influence Prohibition
No entity exercising public authority may receive funding, direction, data access, or material support from a foreign state, foreign political entity, or foreign intelligence-linked organization.
All foreign affiliations and funding streams must be disclosed and are subject to prohibition where they pose risk to republican self-government.

h. Audit and Access Supremacy
Claims of trade secrecy, intellectual property, confidentiality, or proprietary process shall not defeat constitutional audit, disclosure, or oversight requirements where public authority is exercised.
Necessary disclosure shall be compelled under protective conditions where appropriate, but secrecy shall not bar review.

i. Mandatory Termination and Debarment
Upon a finding that an entity has exercised public authority in violation of this Article, the following are mandatory:
	•	immediate termination of contracts or delegations;
	•	permanent debarment from public authority;
	•	forfeiture of tainted funds or benefits;
	•	referral for civil or criminal liability where applicable.

No waiver may be granted for reasons of convenience, capacity, or urgency.

Section 6. Public Funds and Fiduciary Duty

a. Fiduciary Standard
All public funds are fiduciary assets of the People.
Waste, diversion, or misuse constitutes breach of trust.

b. No Off-Book Governance
Hidden budgets, slush funds, and discretionary accounts outside appropriations are forbidden.

c. Audit and Clawback
All expenditures are subject to continuous audit and clawback of misused funds.

d. Trust Property of the People
All public funds, revenues, assets, reserves, and financial instruments are trust property of the People.
No branch, agency, or official holds ownership interest therein, only custodial responsibility.

e. Prohibition on Parallel or Discretionary Finance
No public funds may be held, transferred, expended, or committed outside constitutionally authorized appropriations.
The creation or maintenance of discretionary accounts, revolving funds, contingency pools, or undisclosed financial instruments is forbidden.

f. Continuous and Independent Audit
All public funds are subject to continuous, independent, and adversarial audit.
Audit bodies shall possess full access to records, systems, and personnel and shall not be subordinate to the entities audited.

g. Mandatory Recovery and Personal Liability
Any public funds expended, transferred, or obligated in violation of this Article shall be subject to mandatory clawback.
Officials who authorize, facilitate, or knowingly permit such misuse are personally liable for recovery to the extent of their involvement, as provided by law.

h. Emergency Expenditures
Emergency expenditure of public funds shall be strictly limited in scope and duration and shall expire automatically absent timely legislative ratification.
Repeated or rolling emergency justifications constitute abuse of fiduciary duty.

i. Supremacy of Fiduciary Duty
Claims of secrecy, national security, contractual obligation, or proprietary interest shall not defeat fiduciary audit, disclosure, or recovery of public funds.
Protective handling may be employed, but concealment is prohibited.

Section 7. Whistleblower Supremacy

a. Protected Status
Whistleblowers exposing corruption, capture, fraud, abuse, or constitutional violation act in defense of the Republic.

b. Absolute Protection
Whistleblowers are entitled to absolute protection from retaliation.
Retaliation constitutes a third-tier offense.

c. Mandatory Investigation
Credible disclosures require independent investigation and public reporting of outcomes.

d. Presumption and Burden of Proof
A whistleblower acting under this Article is presumed to act in good faith.
Any adverse action taken against a whistleblower is presumed retaliatory unless the employer proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that the action was unrelated to the disclosure and would have occurred absent the disclosure.

e. Definition of Retaliation
Retaliation includes, but is not limited to:
	•	termination, demotion, or reassignment;
	•	denial of promotion, pay, or benefits;
	•	harassment, isolation, or reputational attack;
	•	security clearance suspension or delay;
	•	legal threats, gag orders, or compelled silence;
	•	spurious investigations or performance actions;
	•	blacklisting or interference with future employment.

f. Interim Protection and Relief
Upon credible disclosure, whistleblowers are entitled to immediate interim protection, including continued employment, pay, benefits, and security status, pending investigation.
No adverse action may proceed absent judicial authorization.

g. Independent Review Requirement
Whistleblower disclosures shall be received and investigated by an independent authority, including Inspectors General or the Constitutional Judicial Commission, structurally insulated from the entity implicated.
No implicated agency may control intake, scope, or outcome of investigation.

h. Public Reporting of Outcomes
The findings, conclusions, and remedial actions resulting from whistleblower investigations shall be publicly disclosed, subject only to narrowly tailored redactions necessary to protect legitimate security or personal privacy interests.
Non-disclosure of outcomes constitutes a separate violation of this Article.

i. Recovery Participation
Where a whistleblower’s disclosure results in recovery of misused public funds or forfeiture of illicit gains, the whistleblower may receive a proportionate share of recovered amounts, as provided by law.
Such participation does not diminish the whistleblower’s protected status.

j. Supremacy of Whistleblower Protection
No nondisclosure agreement, classification rule, employment contract, or statutory secrecy provision may be enforced to suppress disclosures protected under this Article.
Any such provision is void to the extent of conflict.

k. Prohibition on Retaliatory Reclassification or Restructuring
No whistleblower may be subjected, directly or indirectly, to adverse action through reclassification, reorganization, reassignment, position elimination, title change, pay band adjustment, reporting-line modification, duty alteration, or personnel restructuring.
Any such action affecting a whistleblower within the protected period is presumed retaliatory unless the employer proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that the action was part of a uniformly applied, preexisting organizational change planned prior to the protected disclosure and that the whistleblower was not disproportionately burdened relative to similarly situated personnel.

l. Personnel Office Liability
Human resources offices, personnel departments, classification authorities, and their functional equivalents are subject to this Article.
Any participation in retaliatory action, concealment, misclassification, or procedural laundering of retaliation constitutes direct violation of this Article and triggers personal liability for responsible officials.

m. Mandatory Personnel Freeze
Upon a credible whistleblower disclosure, all adverse personnel actions affecting the whistleblower are automatically stayed pending independent investigation and judicial review.
Unauthorized personnel actions taken during the stay are void and constitute separate violations of this Article.

n. Supremacy Over Internal Classification Systems
Internal job classification systems, pay scales, position descriptions, performance frameworks, or organizational charts shall not be used to defeat, obscure, or recharacterize retaliation prohibited under this Article.
Substance controls over form.

Section 8. Scientific and Evidentiary Integrity

a. Evidence-Based Governance
Major public policies shall rest on empirical evidence, transparent data, and reproducible analysis.

b. Data Manipulation Prohibited
Falsifying, suppressing, selectively presenting, or distorting data to justify policy constitutes a grave offense.

c. Burden of Proof
The burden rests upon the government to demonstrate that major policies are supported by sufficient, relevant, and methodologically sound evidence.
Appeals to authority, consensus, or credentialed opinion alone do not satisfy this burden.

d. Methodological Transparency
All empirical evidence used to justify public policy shall disclose:
	•	underlying datasets;
	•	analytical methods;
	•	assumptions, parameters, and exclusions;
	•	funding sources and conflicts of interest;
	•	limitations and uncertainty ranges.

e. Reproducibility Requirement
Where practicable, empirical claims supporting major policy shall be independently reproducible.
Failure of reproducibility shall rebut any presumption of evidentiary sufficiency.

f. Selective Presentation Prohibited
Knowingly presenting selective data, omitting material contrary evidence, or framing analysis to predetermine outcomes constitutes data manipulation under this Article.

g. Policy Nullification
Any major policy adopted in material reliance on falsified, suppressed, nontransparent, or irreproducible evidence is voidable upon challenge.
Courts shall enjoin enforcement pending evidentiary compliance.

h. Scientific Capture
Where scientific or technical processes are subordinated to ideological, financial, or institutional interests, such conduct constitutes institutional capture under Section 3 of this Article.

i. Crisis Claims Do Not Suspend Evidence
Declarations of emergency, urgency, or crisis do not suspend the requirements of evidentiary integrity.
Temporary measures adopted under exigent circumstances shall expire absent subsequent evidentiary justification.

Section 9. Records, Archival Duty, and Permanence

a. Preservation
All public records shall be preserved, indexed, and archived.
Destruction, alteration, or concealment is a constitutional crime.

b. Digital Permanence
Digital systems shall be auditable, traceable, and designed for long-term access.

c. Presumption of Record Status
Any information created, received, transmitted, or maintained in the course of public business constitutes a public record, regardless of format, medium, device, platform, or authorship.
Claims that information is informal, preliminary, personal, ephemeral, or unofficial shall not defeat record status.

d. Prohibition on Ephemeral Systems
The use of systems, applications, or practices designed to auto-delete, obscure, or evade archival preservation in the conduct of public business is forbidden.
Any record created through such systems is deemed intentionally concealed.

e. Device and Account Neutrality
Public record obligations apply regardless of whether public business is conducted on government-issued or personal devices, accounts, or platforms.
Officials bear personal responsibility to preserve and surrender such records upon request.

f. Prohibition on Excessive Redaction
Redaction shall be narrowly tailored and justified line-by-line.
Redaction that obscures substance, patterns, or accountability constitutes constructive concealment.

g. Record Integrity and Chain of Custody
Public records shall maintain verifiable chain-of-custody and integrity metadata sufficient to detect alteration, deletion, or tampering.
Unauthorized modification constitutes alteration under this Article.

h. Irrebuttable Consequences
Destruction, alteration, or concealment of public records gives rise to an irrebuttable presumption of intent to evade accountability.
Good faith, mistake, or administrative error shall not excuse violation.

i. Supremacy Over Retention Policies
No retention schedule, records policy, or administrative rule may authorize destruction or limitation of access inconsistent with this Article.
Where conflict exists, preservation controls.

Section 10. Enforcement and Remedies

a. Standing
Any citizen has standing to challenge violations of this Article.

b. Remedies
Courts may order injunctions, removal from office, dissolution of captured entities, forfeiture of gains, and criminal prosecution.

c. No Immunity
Qualified immunity does not apply to violations of this Article.

d. Prohibition on Nonjusticiability Doctrines
No court shall dismiss or decline adjudication of a claim arising under this Article on grounds of:
	•	political question doctrine;
	•	state secrets privilege;
	•	sovereign immunity;
	•	standing limitations inconsistent with this Article;
	•	ripeness, mootness, or deference doctrines used to evade review.

This Article is fully justiciable.

e. Citizen Enforcement and Qui Tam Actions
Any citizen may bring a civil action on behalf of the Republic to enforce this Article, including actions to recover misused funds, disgorge illicit gains, or void captured actions.
Where recovery results, the citizen may receive a proportionate share of recovered amounts, as provided by law.

f. Mandatory Injunctions
Upon a prima facie showing of violation of this Article, courts shall issue injunctive relief halting the challenged conduct pending resolution.
Equitable discretion shall not be used to permit ongoing constitutional violation.

g. Structural Remedies
Courts are authorized and required to impose structural remedies sufficient to cure constitutional violation, including:
	•	dissolution or reconstitution of captured entities;
	•	termination of programs or authorities;
	•	appointment of independent oversight or receivership;
	•	permanent disqualification of responsible individuals from public authority.
The CJC shall have independent standing to initiate or intervene in any action under this Article. The CRC shall have original and expedited jurisdiction over structural capture claims of national significance or where remedies include dissolution, receivership, or permanent disqualification.
h. Prohibition on Waiver or Settlement
No violation of this Article may be waived, settled, or resolved through confidential agreement.
Any settlement must include public findings, full disclosure, and structural remediation.

i. Continuing Jurisdiction
Courts shall retain jurisdiction to ensure compliance with remedies imposed under this Article.
Recurrence of violation constitutes separate and escalating constitutional breach.

j. Constitutional Supremacy
This Article supersedes all inconsistent statutes, regulations, executive actions, contracts, and doctrines.
No subsequent law may narrow its scope except by constitutional amendment.

k. Attorney Compensation and Assigned Counsel
	•	Cost Reimbursement
Reasonable and documented litigation costs shall be reimbursed in full.
	•	Attorney Fee Cap
Attorney compensation beyond reimbursed costs shall be capped at a fixed percentage of net recovery, not to exceed ten percent (10%).
No multiplier, enhancement, contingency premium, or discretionary increase shall be permitted.
	•	Absolute Compensation Ceiling
No attorney or law firm may receive total compensation from a single action under this Article exceeding a fixed multiple of median household income, as defined by law.
Any agreement in excess of this limitation is void.
	•	Assigned Counsel for Economically Nonviable Claims
Where a court determines that a claim arising under this Article is non-frivolous but economically insufficient to attract private counsel under the fee limitations herein, the state or federal government, as appropriate to venue, shall assign qualified counsel from an authorized public integrity counsel pool.
Assigned counsel shall receive a guaranteed minimum compensation sufficient to ensure competent representation, subject to statutory caps, and shall not receive a percentage of recovery.
	•	Screening and Dismissal Authority
Courts may decline to assign counsel where a claim is determined to be frivolous, abusive, or unworthy of professional legal resources.
Such determinations shall be subject to review for abuse of discretion.
	•	Anti-Solicitation Rule
No attorney may solicit, aggregate, or manufacture claims under this Article for the purpose of fee generation.
Violation constitutes a separate offense and grounds for permanent disqualification from actions under this Article.

Section 11. Intelligence, Espionage, and Foreign Operations — Limited Exemption

a. Narrow Espionage Exemption
Limited secrecy may be permitted for lawful intelligence collection strictly necessary to defend the Republic from concrete external threats.
This exemption is narrow, temporary, and subject to judicial review.

b. Absolute Prohibitions
It is treasonous and forbidden for any agency or instrumentality to:
	•	employ game-theory governance against the People;
	•	conduct or sponsor color revolutions;
	•	agitate regime change absent clear popular support in the affected nation and a direct, material threat to the Republic;
	•	destabilize foreign governments for economic gain, resource acquisition, or arms profiteering;
	•	jail, remove, or discredit foreign leaders through covert manipulation;
	•	fund itself through illicit means or undeclared operations;
	•	promote undue power to any foreign entity or individual.

c. Dissolution Mandate
Any agency that acts against the Republic, undermines constitutional order, or attempts to seize or entrench power shall be dissolved by law.
Responsible individuals shall be prosecuted.

d. Ethical Constraint
All foreign and intelligence operations must meet an objective standard of honor, restraint, proportionality, and moral legitimacy consistent with the Republic’s values.

e. Lawful Assistance to Popular Republican Movements
The Republic may provide material, advisory, humanitarian, or defensive assistance to foreign peoples seeking to establish constitutional self-government, provided that all of the following conditions are met:
	•	the movement demonstrates clear, broad, and verifiable popular support within the affected territory;
	•	assistance is provided openly, lawfully, and without deception;
	•	no attempt is made to select, remove, or control foreign leadership;
	•	no covert intelligence operations, information warfare, or economic manipulation are employed;
	•	assistance is defensive or supportive in nature and does not constitute forcible regime replacement;
	•	participation by citizens shall be voluntary and may not be compelled;
	•	all aid is subject to public disclosure, legislative authorization, and judicial review.

The Republic shall not claim authority over the resulting government, territory, or resources.
Assistance under this Section exists to support self-determination, not to engineer outcomes.

f. Subordination to Civil Authority
Intelligence agencies are instruments of the Republic, not independent centers of power.
No intelligence body possesses inherent authority beyond that expressly granted by the Constitution and law.
Claims of necessity, tradition, or executive prerogative shall not expand intelligence authority.

g. Absolute Prohibition on Domestic Operations
No intelligence agency may conduct surveillance, influence operations, psychological operations, information warfare, or behavioral manipulation against the People of the Republic.
Political movements, civic organizations, journalists, researchers, or lawful dissent shall never constitute legitimate intelligence targets.

h. Prohibition on Narrative Governance
Intelligence agencies shall not engage in domestic narrative shaping, information control, censorship, amplification, or suppression, directly or through proxies.
Any attempt to manage public perception constitutes an act against the Republic.

i. Temporal Limitation of Secrecy
Any secrecy authorized under this Section shall be limited in duration, narrowly scoped, and subject to automatic expiration.
Renewal requires fresh written justification, judicial review, and public disclosure of existence and scope, to the maximum extent consistent with security.

j. Financial and Operational Accountability
Intelligence agencies are subject to the fiduciary, audit, and record-preservation requirements of this Article.
No off-book funding, self-financing, or undisclosed operational accounts are permitted.

k. Individual Accountability
Individuals acting under intelligence authority are personally accountable for violations of this Article.
Obedience to orders, secrecy obligations, or asserted necessity shall not constitute a defense.

l. Automatic Dissolution
Any intelligence agency that engages in prohibited conduct under this Section forfeits its authority and shall be dissolved by operation of law.
Successor entities substantially similar in function or personnel are prohibited.

m. Constitutional Supremacy
Claims of national security shall not override the prohibitions, duties, and limitations imposed by this Article.
Security exists to protect the Republic, not to excuse its subversion.

Section 12. Structural Enforcement Alignment

All transparency, anti-capture, and stewardship obligations apply fully to:

• digital systems,
• AI platforms,
• intelligence-adjacent technologies,
• public–private technical partnerships,
• foreign cooperative instruments.

No domain of power is exempt from scrutiny.

a. Functional Supremacy
Any system, process, platform, or instrument that materially influences, automates, constrains, recommends, or executes public decision-making shall be deemed to exercise public authority for purposes of this Article.
Technical designation, advisory framing, or human-in-the-loop formalism shall not defeat constitutional accountability.

b. Non-Delegable Human Accountability
All exercises of public authority require identifiable human accountability.
No algorithmic, automated, or artificial system may be designated as the final authority for decisions affecting rights, obligations, or public resources.

c. Auditability by Design
Systems exercising or materially influencing public authority shall be designed for auditability, traceability, and inspection sufficient to permit constitutional review.
Systems that cannot be meaningfully audited shall not be deployed for public governance.

d. Transparency of System Inputs and Objectives
Where artificial or technical systems are used in public governance, the following shall be disclosed and preserved:
	•	training data sources or input datasets;
	•	objective functions, constraints, and optimization criteria;
	•	embedded policy assumptions or value judgments;
	•	funding, sponsorship, or external influence on system design.

e. Prohibition on Black Box Authority
No public authority may rely upon systems whose operation, decision pathways, or outputs cannot be explained in a manner sufficient for judicial and public review.
Claims of trade secrecy, intellectual property, or proprietary complexity shall not excuse opacity.

f. Sovereignty of Technical Control
No foreign state, entity, or individual may exercise control, update authority, or remote influence over systems used in public governance.
Foreign cooperation shall not include operational dependence or concealed control.

g. Continuous Constitutional Review
All systems exercising public authority are subject to ongoing constitutional review.
Upon determination of noncompliance, bias, opacity, or capture, deployment shall be suspended or terminated immediately.

h. Emerging Domain Applicability
The obligations of this Article apply fully to future domains of power, including but not limited to cyber-physical systems, bio-technical governance tools, predictive analytics, behavioral modeling, and any successor technologies exercising public authority.

Section 13. Willful Institutional Betrayal and Constitutional Treason

(a) Willful Institutional Betrayal Defined
A willful institutional betrayal occurs where a person, acting under color of law, public office, delegated authority, contractual proxy, or institutional control, knowingly and voluntarily violates a clear constitutional duty imposed by this Article, with intent to conceal power, evade accountability, enable capture, suppress lawful transparency, or defeat the sovereignty of the People.

Mere negligence, error, disagreement, or good-faith judgment shall not constitute willful institutional betrayal.

(b) Constitutional Treason Classification
Any egregious and willful institutional betrayal under this Article shall constitute treason against the Republic and shall be classified as a Tier Three offense under Article VII.

Such treason consists in the corruption of public trust, the deliberate subversion of transparency, or the concealment of constitutional violations through secrecy, capture, or proxy governance.

(c) High Treason by Secrecy or Capture
Where a willful institutional betrayal:
	•	results in the death of innocent persons;
	•	results in the unlawful confinement, disappearance, or permanent deprivation of liberty of innocent persons;
	•	enables, conceals, or prolongs mass constitutional violations through secrecy, misclassification, capture, or proxy structures; or
	•	permits grave offenses to persist by suppressing disclosure, investigation, or remedy;

such conduct may be classified as high treason.

High treason is among the few offenses for which the federal government may consider capital punishment, subject to the strict conditions of this Constitution.
The presumptive and preferred punishment shall remain lifetime incapacitating confinement, absent extraordinary findings.

(d) Mandatory Consequences Upon Conviction
Any person convicted under this Section shall, at minimum:
	•	permanently forfeit Civic Citizenship;
	•	suffer total confiscation of all property and assets, real and personal, without compensation;
	•	be subject to permanent restriction of travel beyond a narrowly defined geographic area;
	•	be disqualified for life from holding public office, exercising public authority, or engaging in employment above a menial or supervised level;
	•	be subject to formal public censure, including permanent public records, disclosures, and reminders of the offense in all future dealings with the Republic.

No pardon, commutation, sealing, or restoration of status shall be granted except by constitutional supermajority following public notice.

(e) Additional Punishments and Civic Sanctions
Depending on the scale, duration, and consequences of the betrayal, sentencing may include:
	•	lifetime confinement under Tier Three conditions;
	•	compulsory labor consistent with humane standards;
	•	permanent disbarment from licensed professions;
	•	civic ridicule, including mandated acknowledgment of wrongdoing, public exposure of acts committed, and symbolic sanctions designed to preserve constitutional memory and deter future abuse.

Such sanctions shall serve deterrence, moral clarity, and institutional purification — not cruelty or spectacle.

(f) Strict Proof of Willfulness and Absence of Coercion
No conviction may be entered under this Section unless the prosecution proves beyond a reasonable doubt that:
	•	the defendant acted without coercion, duress, threat, or unlawful pressure;
	•	the defendant possessed actual knowledge of the constitutional duty violated;
	•	the defendant had meaningful opportunity to refuse, disclose, or resist the unlawful act;
	•	the defendant nevertheless chose concealment, capture, or betrayal of public trust.

Where credible evidence of coercion exists, prosecution shall instead proceed against those responsible for the coercive act.

(g) No Shield of Secrecy, Classification, or Delegation
Neither secrecy classification, national security designation, contractual delegation, proxy governance, emergency declaration, nor institutional custom shall excuse or mitigate liability under this Section.

Use of secrecy to conceal betrayal shall constitute an aggravating factor.

(h) Construction and Lock Status
This Section shall be construed narrowly but firmly, reserved for the gravest acts of institutional betrayal.

Pursuant to Article XV, this Section is lock-protected and may not be repealed, weakened, reinterpreted, or suspended except by constitutional amendment meeting the highest procedural threshold.

Section 14. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to ensure that the Republic governs in the open; that power does not accumulate in shadows; and that no institution may place itself above the People, the Constitution, or the moral limits of just action.

Nothing hidden shall be permitted to rule.

a. Presumption of Openness
Any ambiguity in the application or interpretation of this Article shall be resolved in favor of transparency, disclosure, accountability, and public access.
Claims favoring secrecy, insulation, or discretion bear the burden of proof.

b. Anti-Evasion Principle
Compliance with the form of this Article without compliance with its substance constitutes violation.
Courts shall look to practical effect, not formal designation, when determining compliance.

c. Supremacy Over Contrary Doctrine
No precedent, doctrine, tradition, or interpretive rule inconsistent with this Article shall be applied to narrow its scope or defeat its purpose.
Where conflict exists, this Article controls.

d. No Deference to Authority
Courts shall not defer to assertions of expertise, necessity, discretion, or institutional competence when reviewing actions under this Article.
Constitutional accountability supersedes administrative or technical judgment.

e. Integrated Construction
This Article shall be construed as an integrated whole.
No provision may be interpreted in isolation to undermine the force or intent of another.

f. No Novelty Exemption
Novelty of technology, structure, jurisdiction, or method does not exempt any exercise of power from this Article.
New forms of authority are subject to equal or greater scrutiny.

g. Moral Limitation
No interpretation of this Article may be adopted that legitimizes corruption, concealment, exploitation, or domination inconsistent with republican self-government.
Where competing interpretations exist, the one that most constrains abuse of power shall prevail.
h. Self-Executing Confirmation
This Article is self-executing in all its parts.
Failure of legislative or executive implementation does not delay or diminish its force.
	•	Constitutional Adjudication and Integrity Enforcement
All determinations of constitutional meaning, validity, nullification, or legal effect under this Article shall be made in the first instance by the Constitutional Review Court, subject to appellate or discretionary review by the Supreme Court of the Republic. A determination of the Constitutional Review Court shall be final if the Supreme Court declines review, unless the Constitutional Review Court certifies that the matter requires appellate consideration.

The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall possess concurrent and independent authority to investigate, certify, and refer institutional capture, concealment, obstruction, retaliation, or abuse of secrecy relating to this Article, and to trigger mandatory review by the Constitutional Review Court.

No court, agency, or authority may substitute for, bypass, or absorb either function.
