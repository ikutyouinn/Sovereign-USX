Article XI-E — Digital Commons Enforcement Integration

Section 1. Recognition of the DCEA

The Digital Commons Enforcement Authority (DCEA) established under Article X, Section 7 is hereby recognized as a constitutional oversight and enforcement body for purposes of this Article.

The DCEA shall possess all investigatory, subpoena, audit, forfeiture, and enforcement powers necessary to:

• prevent institutional capture of digital infrastructure;
• detect suppression or manipulation of public knowledge;
• expose software enclosure, algorithmic control, and platform coercion; and
• enforce all Jubilee, preservation, and openness obligations.

Section 2. Anti-Capture Status

The DCEA is hereby designated a high-integrity oversight authority under this Article.

Any attempt to:

• defund, restrict, obstruct, politicize, or capture the DCEA;
• withhold information from it;
• interfere with its investigations;
• or retaliate against its officers or whistleblowers

shall constitute institutional capture, subject to the highest remedies and penalties of Article XI.

Section 3. Cross-Standing and Remedies

The DCEA shall have standing to invoke all remedies under this Article, including:

• nullification of tainted actions;
• forfeiture of unlawfully gained assets;
• disqualification of corrupt officials or contractors;
• mandatory public disclosure; and
• referral for Tier-Three crimes under Article VII.

Likewise, inspectors general, courts, juries, and civic petitioners under this Article may enforce violations of Article X, Section 7 through the DCEA.

Section 4. Supremacy of Preservation

Where any digital system, software platform, or information infrastructure is implicated in corruption, capture, or suppression of public knowledge, preservation and disclosure shall take precedence over secrecy, trade claims, or proprietary interest.
