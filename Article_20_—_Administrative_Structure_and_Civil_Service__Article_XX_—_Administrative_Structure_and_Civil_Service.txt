Article XX — Administrative Structure and Civil Service

Charge

This Article establishes constitutional principles governing the structure, authority, and operation of administrative bodies and the civil service within the Republic. Administrative authority shall be executive in nature, limited to the faithful implementation of law, and subordinate to constitutional governance, democratic accountability, and the rights of the People. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to authorize administrative sovereignty, independent policymaking, or the exercise of power beyond that expressly granted by law and subject to transparency and judicial review.

Section 1. Nature of Administrative Authority

a. Executive and Subordinate Character
Administrative authority is executive in nature and exists solely to carry out and implement lawfully enacted decisions of the constitutional branches.
Administrative bodies possess no independent sovereignty, legitimacy, or authority apart from that which is expressly granted by law.

b. No Policymaking or Lawmaking Power
No administrative body, office, or official may create, amend, suspend, interpret, or expand law, policy, or rights beyond explicit statutory authorization.
Administrative interpretation shall be limited to faithful execution and shall not substitute internal judgment, theory, or preference for enacted law.

c. Instrumental Role
Administration is an instrument of governance, not a governing authority.
Administrative bodies shall execute decisions made through lawful constitutional processes and shall not claim authority derived from expertise, professionalism, efficiency, necessity, or institutional continuity.

d. Prohibition on Independent Doctrine
No administrative body may adopt internal doctrines, frameworks, professional standards, academic theories, or ideological constructs as binding authority absent explicit legislative enactment.
Internal guidance shall not possess the force of law.

e. Non-Expansion by Practice or Custom
Administrative authority shall not expand through custom, precedent, internal practice, emergency habit, or historical usage.
Powers not expressly granted are reserved and withheld.

f. Transparency and Accountability
All exercises of administrative authority are subject to transparency, recordkeeping, and public accountability consistent with Article XI.
Administrative convenience shall not justify opacity, discretion without review, or insulation from oversight.

g. Subordination to Constitutional Limits
Administrative authority is always subordinate to the Constitution, the laws enacted thereunder, and the rights of the People.
Any administrative act inconsistent with constitutional limitation is void and shall be so declared by the Constitutional Review Court upon petition by any affected person, the CJC, or the Legislature.

Section 2. Civil Service as Public Stewardship

a. Civil Service as Trust
Civil service is a public trust exercised on behalf of the People.
Civil servants hold authority only as stewards and custodians of lawful public functions, not as independent actors or policy authorities.

b. Duty of Loyalty and Neutrality
Civil servants owe a duty of loyalty to the Constitution and the law, not to any political party, faction, ideology, doctrine, academic school, or private interest.
The execution of public duties shall be neutral, impartial, and faithful to enacted law.

c. Duty of Candor
Civil servants have an affirmative duty of honesty and candor in all official actions, records, communications, and representations.
Knowingly misleading the public, elected officials, courts, or oversight bodies constitutes a breach of public trust.

d. Service, Not Governance
Civil service exists to administer and implement decisions lawfully made by constitutional authorities.
Civil servants shall not govern, direct public outcomes, or substitute administrative judgment for democratic or judicial decision-making.

e. No Independent Public Mandate
Civil servants possess no independent mandate from expertise, professionalism, credentialing, or institutional role.
Public legitimacy flows solely from the Constitution and laws enacted thereunder.

f. Fiduciary Responsibility
Civil servants shall exercise care, restraint, and diligence in the use of public authority, resources, and information.
Misuse of authority for personal, institutional, ideological, or concealed purposes constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty.

g. Accountability to the People
Civil servants are accountable to the People through lawful oversight, transparency, and review.
Claims of internal discretion, professional judgment, or administrative necessity shall not defeat accountability.

Section 3. Limits of Administrative Power

a. No Implied Authority
Administrative bodies possess only those powers expressly granted by the Constitution or by law.
No power shall be implied from necessity, efficiency, expertise, tradition, or institutional practice.

b. Prohibition on Independent Rulemaking
No administrative body may promulgate rules, standards, guidance, or directives having binding effect absent explicit legislative authorization.
Administrative instruments lacking such authorization shall have no force of law.

c. No Expansion by Interpretation
Statutory ambiguity shall not be construed to enlarge administrative authority.
Where doubt exists, interpretation shall favor restraint and deference to legislative intent.

d. Emergency Authority Strictly Limited
Claims of emergency or exigency do not create new administrative powers.
Any temporary authority exercised under emergency conditions shall be narrowly construed and shall expire automatically absent timely legislative ratification.

e. Internal Policies Not Law
Internal manuals, policies, professional standards, best practices, or compliance frameworks shall not create enforceable obligations for the public absent express legal enactment.
Violation of internal policy alone shall not constitute legal wrongdoing.

f. No Authority by Delegation Chain
Administrative authority shall not be enlarged through cascading delegation, subcontracting, or internal redistribution of responsibility.
Delegated authority shall be construed narrowly and may not exceed the scope of the original grant.

g. Reservation of Power
All powers not expressly conferred upon administrative bodies are reserved to the People and the constitutional branches.
Silence shall not be interpreted as consent.
h. Emergency Authority Sunset
Any administrative authority exercised on the basis of emergency, urgency, or exigency shall expire automatically within a fixed period unless expressly ratified by the Legislature.

Successive or rolling emergency claims for the same or substantially similar purpose are prohibited absent a new and distinct legislative grant.

Merit in civil service appointment, promotion, and retention shall be defined by demonstrable competence, qualifications, experience, and performance directly related to the lawful duties of the position.

Administrative bodies shall not conceal, resolve internally, or substitute discipline for adjudication of such conduct.

e. Prohibition on Internal Adjudication of Rights
Administrative bodies shall not adjudicate guilt, innocence, liability, or constitutional rights.
Any attempt to do so constitutes an unlawful assumption of judicial power.

Where the unlawfulness of an order is reasonably disputed, good-faith refusal or delay pending clarification or review shall be protected conduct.

f. Escalation of Systemic Abuse
