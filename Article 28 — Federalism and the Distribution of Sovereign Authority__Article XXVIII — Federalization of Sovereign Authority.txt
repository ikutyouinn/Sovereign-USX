Article XXVIII — Federalization of Sovereign Authority

Charge

A Republic that centralizes all authority becomes brittle, unresponsive, and tyrannical.
A Republic that fragments without order dissolves into paralysis and factional decay.

Federalism exists to preserve liberty by dividing power, disciplining ambition, and allowing lawful diversity of governance within a unified constitutional order. Power shall be delegated upward only where necessary, retained locally wherever possible, and exercised always as a trust held for the People.

This Article affirms that sovereignty originates with the People, is exercised through layered institutions, and must never be consolidated beyond constitutional necessity.

Legal Text

Section 1. Source of Sovereign Authority

All sovereign authority derives from the People.

The People delegate defined powers to local, state, and federal institutions through this Constitution. No level of government possesses inherent authority beyond that which is expressly granted or necessarily implied.

Section 2. Reserved Powers

All powers not expressly delegated to the federal government by this Constitution are reserved to the States and to the People.

Federal authority shall be construed narrowly where ambiguity exists. Silence shall not be interpreted as permission for expansion.

Section 3. Enumerated Federal Responsibilities

The federal government shall exercise exclusive authority only over matters that are inherently national in scope, including:

a. national defense and the lawful use of force;
b. foreign relations, treaties, and diplomacy;
c. protection of constitutional rights against state infringement;
d. regulation of interstate and international commerce where uniformity is indispensable;
e. maintenance of national currency, weights, measures, and standards;
f. constitutional adjudication and enforcement.

No additional powers shall be implied absent clear constitutional authorization.

Section 4. Concurrent Authority, Preemption, and Regulatory Limits

Where federal and state authority overlap, federal law shall prevail only when:

a. the subject matter is inherently national in scope; and
b. uniformity is demonstrably necessary to preserve constitutional rights, national security, or the structural integrity of the Republic.

Preemption shall not be presumed. The burden of justification rests with the federal authority.

Federal regulations shall not preempt state law unless Congress has expressly authorized such preemption by statute, and only where the regulation independently satisfies the criteria of this Section.

No agency may create preemption by interpretation, guidance, rulemaking, or enforcement practice absent explicit legislative authorization.

Section 5. Experimental Governance and Policy Diversity

States may enact policies, programs, and regulatory frameworks that exceed federal minimum standards or diverge from federal practice, provided such measures do not violate constitutional rights.

The federal government shall not penalize, coerce, or financially sabotage states for lawful policy divergence.

Innovation through lawful experimentation is a protected feature of the Republic.

Section 6. Anti-Commandeering and Anti-Coercion

The federal government shall not compel states, state officials, or state resources to enforce federal law absent explicit constitutional authorization.

Coercive funding conditions, administrative mandates, or indirect enforcement mechanisms shall not substitute for lawful authority.

No federal funding program may be structured, conditioned, or administered in a manner that creates fiscal dependency or economic pressure so severe as to effectively coerce state compliance with federal policy.
The mechanisms, procedures, and remedies for State interposition and nullification are governed exclusively by Article XXVIII-A.
Voluntary participation shall be genuine, reversible, and free from punitive consequence.
Section 6A. Agricultural Liberty and the Non-Prohibition Rule

(a) Presumption of Agricultural Liberty.
Cultivation and commerce in Crops are presumptively lawful. The Republic shall treat Crops as ordinary articles of agriculture and commerce unless and until the Republic proves otherwise under this Section.

(b) Ban on Blanket Crop Prohibitions.
No Blanket Crop Prohibition shall be enacted, enforced, or maintained by the federal government unless Congress proves, by clear and convincing evidence, all of the following:

  (1) Significant Harm.
  The Crop, by its ordinary cultivation or ordinary commercial handling, creates a genuine, direct, and material risk of serious harm to persons, public health, or cross-border stability, and the harm is not speculative.

  (2) No Substantial Lawful Purpose.
  The Crop serves no Substantial Medicinal Purpose and no Substantial Commercial Purpose.

  (3) Least Restrictive Means.
  No narrower regulatory approach can materially mitigate the proven harm, including regulation of contaminants, labeling, concentration, age restrictions, licensing of high-risk processing, impaired operation rules, anti-diversion controls, taxation parity, or targeted enforcement against specific harmful conduct.

(c) No Agency-Created Crop Bans.
No agency, court, or executive actor may create or expand a Blanket Crop Prohibition by interpretation, guidance, scheduling, classification, or enforcement practice absent a statute that satisfies subsection (b). This subsection supplements Section 4 and Section 6 of this Article.

(d) Sunset and Re-Proof.
Any federal restriction that amounts to a Blanket Crop Prohibition shall sunset automatically after five (5) years unless reauthorized by statute and re-proven under subsection (b) based on current evidence.

(e) Construction.
This Section shall be construed broadly in favor of cultivation, agricultural experimentation, and lawful commerce, and narrowly against prohibition by moral panic, political fashion, or administrative convenience.


Section 7. Transparency of Federal–State Interaction

All federal conditions attached to funding, regulatory cooperation, or program participation shall be disclosed in plain language and approved through recorded legislative votes.

No undisclosed obligation, informal pressure, or conditional dependency shall bind a state.

Section 8. State Participation in Federal Processes

States shall retain meaningful participation in federal governance through:

a. representation in the Legislature as defined elsewhere in this Constitution;
b. participation in advisory, review, or deliberative bodies where constitutionally authorized;
c. the right to challenge federal overreach through the courts.

States shall not be reduced to administrative subdivisions of the federal government.

Section 9. Civic Participation and Deliberative Federalism

The Republic may employ deliberative mechanisms incorporating Civic Citizens to review, advise upon, or evaluate federal policy affecting state sovereignty.

Any Civic Citizens so engaged shall be selected and governed in accordance with Article III, Section 13 (Civic Lottery Service and Deliberative Duty).

Such bodies shall be advisory only and shall not displace elected authority.

Section 10. Harmonization with Legislative Integrity

Federal legislation subject to phased or state-by-state rollout under Article XXVII shall respect state autonomy in implementation methods, enforcement priorities, and administrative design, unless uniformity is constitutionally indispensable.

States shall not be compelled to implement federal law beyond the scope authorized by this Constitution.

Section 11. Emergency Powers and Temporary Federal Coordination

In cases of declared national emergency, including invasion, insurrection, pandemic, or catastrophic natural disaster, the federal government may temporarily assume expanded coordinating authority solely for the purpose of harmonization and resource allocation, not displacement of lawful state authority.

Such authority requires:

a. a declared emergency;
b. approval by a two-thirds (⅔) vote of both legislative houses;
c. a narrowly tailored scope limited to the emergency;
d. automatic sunset not exceeding one (1) year unless renewed by identical vote.

Emergency authority shall not permanently preempt state law, suspend constitutional rights, or create enduring federal jurisdiction.
Nothing in this Article shall be construed to exempt any state law from the supremacy of this Constitution or the inviolable rights it secures.

Section 12. Program Sunset, Metrics, and Devolution

All federal programs materially affecting state governance shall expire after ten (10) years unless affirmatively reauthorized by Congress.

Each such program shall state explicit, measurable objectives.

Failure to meet stated objectives shall trigger automatic review and presumptive devolution of authority to the states.

Section 13. Exit Rights and Fiscal Rebalancing

States may opt out of federal programs not constitutionally mandatory, subject to reasonable notice.

Where opt-out occurs, the state shall receive a proportional tax rebate or fiscal credit reflecting its contribution, adjusted for shared national obligations.

No opt-out shall result in punitive withholding of unrelated funds or services.

Section 14. Prohibition of Secession and Unilateral Nullification

No state, subdivision, or authority may unilaterally secede from the Republic or nullify federal law duly enacted in compliance with this Constitution.
Redress of grievances shall occur through constitutional processes, including judicial review, legislative challenge, amendment, or lawful withdrawal of delegated authority by the People.  This prohibition does not bar lawful nullification under Article XXVIII-A or lawful secession or partition under Articles 28-B and 28-C.

Section 15. Standing, Sovereign Immunity, and Judicial Review

Any state, civic citizen, or lawful resident with standing may challenge violations of this Article.

Citizens may challenge federal actions that unlawfully undermine legitimate state law or state sovereignty.

No claim of sovereign immunity shall bar suit where the federal government or its agents exceed constitutional authority or encroach upon reserved state powers.

The Constitutional Review Court shall review such claims without deference and shall enjoin unconstitutional actions.

Section 16. Ceremonial Offices and Cultural Continuity
	•	State Cultural Autonomy
A State may, consistent with this Constitution, retain or establish ceremonial, cultural, or historical offices—including monarchs, traditional leaders, or symbolic heads of state—provided that such offices exercise no sovereign authority, no coercive power, and no lawmaking or veto authority under this Constitution.
	•	No Sovereignty or Legal Authority
Ceremonial offices shall confer no authority over legislation, adjudication, enforcement, taxation, defense, or administration, and shall not supersede or dilute the supremacy of constitutional governance.
	•	No Citizenship by Title or Office
Holding a ceremonial or hereditary office shall not confer civic citizenship, political rights, voting privileges, office-holding eligibility, or exemption from any civic duty.
Any individual occupying such an office shall be subject to the same requirements for citizenship, service, taxation, and accountability as any other person.
	•	Equal Civic Obligation
Individuals holding ceremonial offices shall, if seeking civic citizenship, satisfy the same conditions of service, contribution, and allegiance required of all applicants, without exception or preferential treatment.
	•	Security Without Privilege
A State may provide reasonable protection to ceremonial officeholders against credible threats or opportunistic harm, provided such protection does not create immunity from law, special legal status, or exemption from investigation, prosecution, or judgment.
	•	Selection and Succession
The method of designation, succession, or removal of ceremonial offices is a matter of state cultural law and shall have no legal effect beyond symbolic representation.
Such methods shall not bind other States, the Republic, or future governments.
	•	Judicial Non-Interference
No court shall construe the presence of ceremonial or cultural offices as incompatible with republican governance, provided that all sovereign authority remains derived from and constrained by this Constitution.

Section 17. Prohibition of Unfunded Mandates

(a) No level of government may impose duties, mandates, regulatory requirements, or administrative obligations upon subordinate governments, private entities, or individuals without providing full funding sufficient to cover the costs of compliance.

(b) Unfunded mandates are presumptively void. The burden rests upon the imposing authority to demonstrate full funding or de minimis cost.

(c) Conditional grants, coercive funding mechanisms, or threats of withdrawal of unrelated funds shall not be used to compel compliance with mandates prohibited by this Section.

(d) This prohibition shall be construed broadly to prevent indirect coercion and evasion of sovereign authority.

Section 18. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to preserve liberty through division of power, prevent consolidation of authority, and favor local governance where national necessity is not proven.

Efficiency, convenience, and administrative uniformity shall not override constitutional structure.
