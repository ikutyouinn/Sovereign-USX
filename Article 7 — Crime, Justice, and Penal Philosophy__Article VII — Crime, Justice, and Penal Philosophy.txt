Article VII — Crime, Justice, and Penal Philosophy

Charge
This Article establishes the constitutional framework governing criminal liability, adjudication, punishment, and penal restraint within the Republic. All provisions of this Article shall be construed to ensure legality, proportionality, due process, and restraint in the exercise of the State’s punitive power. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to authorize punishment, detention, or coercive sanction except as expressly provided by law and consistent with constitutional safeguards.

Section 1. Purpose of Criminal Law

a. Protection of the Innocent
The foremost purpose of criminal law is the protection of innocent persons from violence, coercion, exploitation, and fraud.

No legal theory, procedure, or ideology may supersede this duty.

b. Preservation of Public Order
Criminal law exists to preserve public order so that liberty may exist without fear.
Lawlessness is not freedom; it is the abdication of justice.

c. Accountability for Harm
Crime is defined by harm done, not merely by rule violation.
Where harm exists, accountability must follow.

d. Restoration Where Possible
Where crimes admit of repair, the justice system shall prioritize:
	•	restitution to victims;
	•	restoration of property and opportunity;
	•	repair of social trust.

Where harm is reparable, restitution to the injured party shall take precedence over punitive confinement, except where confinement is necessary for public safety.

e. Incapacitation Where Necessary
Where an offender poses a continuing danger, removal from society is justified to protect life and order.

The safety of the many outweighs the comfort of the irredeemable.

f. Moral Clarity
The law shall distinguish clearly between:
	•	accident and intent,
	•	weakness and malice,
	•	error and predation.

Justice fails when it refuses to name evil.

g. Rejection of Legal Formalism as Escape
No person guilty of heinous crimes—including murder, rape, sexual exploitation, trafficking, or severe violence—shall escape accountability solely due to procedural defects.

Procedural violations by officials shall be punished separately and severely,
but truthfully obtained evidence of grave crimes remains admissible.

Justice shall not sacrifice the innocent to preserve technical purity.

h. Equal Obligation Under Law
All persons—citizens and lawful residents alike—are equally bound by criminal law and equally entitled to its protections.

No caste, office, ideology, or status grants immunity from accountability.

i. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to ensure that criminal law serves truth, safety, and justice—
not ideology, convenience, or abstraction.

Section 2. The Three Tiers of Justice

a. Principle of Differentiated Justice
Justice shall be administered according to the nature of the offender, the degree of harm caused, and the likelihood of rehabilitation.

The Republic rejects both indiscriminate punishment and indiscriminate leniency.

Accordingly, criminal justice shall be structured into three distinct tiers.

b. Tier One: Therapeutic Justice (Rehabilitation Without Incarceration)
Tier One applies to offenders whose conduct arises primarily from:
	•	substance addiction;
	•	mental illness;
	•	psychological impairment;
	•	developmental incapacity;
	•	situational crisis;

and who do not pose a continuing threat of violence or predation.

Measures under Tier One may include:
	•	mandatory treatment or detoxification;
	•	psychiatric or psychological care;
	•	supervised community programs;
	•	vocational training;
	•	restorative justice processes;
	•	monitored reintegration.

Tier One exists to heal, not to punish.

Failure to comply with Tier One requirements shall result in escalation to Tier Two.
Repeat offenses, organized schemes, or demonstrated patterns of predation may elevate an offense classification from Tier-One Offense to Tier-Two Offense by objective criteria defined by law.

Any elevation of offense classification based on repetition, organization, or pattern shall be governed by objective statutory criteria, applied uniformly, and subject to appeal.

Elevation of offense classification does not, by itself, require denial of Tier One disposition where the court finds continued suitability under subsection (b), unless implementing law so provides.

c. Completion and Finality of Tier One Dispositions
Completion of all court-ordered requirements under Tier One constitutes full satisfaction of criminal liability for the offense.

No further punishment, disability, or collateral consequence may be imposed upon completion.

Time served is time served.

d. Sealing of Tier One Records
Records of Tier One offenses shall be:
	•	sealed from public access;
	•	unavailable to employers, landlords, insurers, or private parties;
	•	accessible only to courts and law enforcement for limited judicial purposes.

Tier One records may not be used to:
	•	deny employment;
	•	deny housing;
	•	deny education;
	•	impose civil penalties;
	•	justify enhanced sentencing for unrelated offenses.

e. Protection Against Recriminalization
No person who has successfully completed Tier One requirements shall be subjected to conditions or restrictions that:
	•	foreseeably push them toward recidivism;
	•	function as de facto punishment;
	•	undermine rehabilitation.

The Republic shall not sabotage its own justice.

f. Tier Two: Rehabilitative Incarceration
Tier Two applies to offenders who:
	•	commit serious crimes;
	•	demonstrate willful wrongdoing;
	•	require confinement for public safety;
but who retain a reasonable prospect of reform.

Confinement under Tier Two shall:
	•	be secure and disciplined;
	•	require labor, education, or training;
	•	prioritize restitution to victims;
	•	provide moral, psychological, and vocational rehabilitation;
	•	condition privileges and release upon demonstrated reform.

Comfort is not the aim; correction is.

g. Tier Three: Punitive Incapacitation
Tier Three applies exclusively to offenders who are:
	•	convicted of heinous crimes, including murder, rape, child sexual exploitation, trafficking, or acts of extreme violence;
	•	repeat violent offenders demonstrating incorrigibility;
	•	demonstrably unrepentant, predatory, or irreversibly dangerous.

Tier Three confinement shall:
	•	prioritize permanent protection of society;
	•	impose harsh and demanding conditions proportional to the offense;
	•	deny privileges unrelated to basic human survival;
	•	require compulsory labor where physically possible;
	•	exclude early release except under extraordinary judicial review.

This tier exists not to rehabilitate, but to restrain and punish.

Conditions shall be harsh but not cruel.

h. Prohibition on Tier Conflation
No authority may:
	•	treat Tier Three offenders as candidates for routine leniency;
	•	impose Tier Three conditions on Tier One offenders;
	•	collapse all offenders into a single penal model.

Justice requires distinction.

i. Review and Movement Between Tiers
Movement between tiers may occur only:
	•	by judicial review;
	•	upon clear evidence of change or deterioration;
	•	with victim input considered where applicable.

Escalation is permitted for noncompliance, deception, or new offenses.

De-escalation requires sustained proof of reform.

j. Moral Foundation
Mercy is owed to the repentant.
Correction is owed to the errant.
Severity is owed to the wicked.

The Republic shall not confuse these duties.

k. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to preserve moral clarity, protect the innocent, and ensure that justice remains humane without becoming weak, and severe without becoming cruel.

Section 2A. Cross-Reference: Structural and Institutional Crimes

a. Constitutional Escalation
Any act declared a grave offense under:
	•	Corporate Legitimacy and Accountability;
	•	Knowledge, Technology, and the Digital Commons;
	•	Transparency, Anti-Capture, and Public Stewardship;

shall, when committed with intent, coordination, or systemic scale, qualify as a Tier Three crime under this Article.

b. Institutional Malice
Where harm arises not from isolated conduct but from organized systems, policies, technologies, or corporate structures, culpability shall extend to:
	•	architects of the system;
	•	beneficiaries of the harm;
	•	enforcers and facilitators;
	•	those who knowingly conceal, excuse, or profit from the offense.

c. No Shield of Abstraction
Corporate form, algorithmic mediation, financial instruments, bureaucratic distance, or institutional layering shall not mitigate criminal liability.

Structural harm is personal harm at scale.

Section 2B. Classification of Offenses
 Offenses shall be classified as: 
	•	Tier One (minor): Non-violent, low-harm conduct; punishments limited to fines, community service, or short-term restrictions. 

	•	Tier Two (serious): Conduct involving moderate violence, fraud, or harm; punishments may include incarceration up to 10 years, restitution, and supervised release. 


	•	Tier Three / Grave (heinous): As defined in Article 0; punishments may include lifetime confinement, mandatory labor under humane standards, permanent forfeiture of certain rights (subject to due process review), or, in extraordinary cases involving mass death or betrayal resulting in irreparable harm, capital punishment (subject to unanimous jury finding, multiple layers of review, and preference for lifetime incapacitation absent clear necessity).

	•	All classifications and punishments must be proportionate, evidence-based, and subject to appellate review.

Section 2C. Temporary Protective Measures for Imminent Threats
 Where clear and convincing evidence establishes an Imminent Threat of Grave Harm (as defined in Article 0), courts may issue temporary orders restricting access to firearms, liberty of movement, or other means of harm (e.g., extreme risk protection orders). Such orders shall: 

	•	Be strictly time-limited (initially not exceeding 14–30 days); 
	•	Require an adversarial hearing within 72 hours where feasible; 
	•	Include a clear pathway for immediate restoration upon cessation of the threat; 
	•	Be narrowly tailored and subject to expedited appeal; 
	•	Never become permanent absent full due process under Section 5 of Article II. These measures are civil in nature and do not constitute punishment.


Section 3. Standards of Guilt, Evidence, and Truth

a. Presumption of Innocence
Every accused person is presumed innocent until guilt is established through lawful adjudication.

This presumption protects the innocent; it shall not be weaponized to shield the guilty through deception, intimidation, or technical gamesmanship.

b. Burden of Proof
The burden of proof rests entirely upon the prosecuting authority.

Guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt for criminal conviction.

Reasonable doubt concerns truth and material facts, not speculative, manufactured, or ideological uncertainty.

c. Mens Rea (State of Mind)
Criminal liability shall account for intent and mental state.

The law shall distinguish among:
	•	intentional acts;
	•	knowing acts;
	•	reckless acts;
	•	negligent acts;
	•	accidental acts.

Punishment must be proportionate to both harm and intent.

d. Admissibility of Evidence
All evidence that is:
	•	materially relevant;
	•	reliable;
	•	probative of truth;

shall be admissible, regardless of how it was obtained, provided that its authenticity and accuracy are established.

Procedural violations in evidence collection shall not invalidate truthful proof of grave crimes.

e. Separate Accountability for Official Misconduct
Any official who unlawfully obtains evidence shall be:
	•	prosecuted independently;
	•	subject to severe penalties;
	•	barred from office where appropriate.

Justice shall punish wrongdoing without nullifying truth.

f. Exclusion of Fabricated or Coerced Evidence
Evidence shall be excluded if it is:
	•	fabricated;
	•	materially altered;
	•	knowingly falsified;
	•	proven to be unreliable;
	•	obtained through coercion rendering it untruthful.

Truth is not served by lies, even in pursuit of justice.

g. Corroboration for Extraordinary Claims
Extraordinary accusations shall require corroboration proportional to the severity of the charge.

No person shall be convicted solely on the basis of:
	•	uncorroborated hearsay;
	•	speculative inference;
	•	ideological presumption;
	•	collective guilt;
	•	demographic assumption.

Justice demands proof, not narratives.

h. Confessions and Admissions
Confessions are admissible only if:
	•	voluntarily given;
	•	corroborated by independent evidence;
	•	not induced by coercion, torture, or threat.

Truth extracted through cruelty is unreliable and forbidden.

i. Scientific and Technical Evidence
Scientific, forensic, or technical evidence must:
	•	meet established standards of reliability;
	•	be subject to independent verification;
	•	be transparent and reproducible;
	•	disclose error rates and limitations.

Pseudo-science and politicized expertise are inadmissible.

j. Truth-Seeking Authority of the Court
Judges possess affirmative authority to:
	•	question evidence;
	•	seek clarification;
	•	order independent testing;
	•	require additional proof;
	•	reject narratives unsupported by fact.

The court exists to discover truth, not to referee performances.

k. Jury Integrity
Juries shall be composed of impartial peers.

No juror may be selected or excluded on ideological, racial, religious, or political grounds.

Jury tampering, intimidation, or manipulation constitutes a grave offense.

l. Verdict Integrity
Verdicts must reflect:
	•	evidence presented;
	•	lawful instructions;
	•	rational deliberation.

Nullification motivated by ideology, intimidation, or coercion is forbidden.

m. Appeals
Appeals shall address:
	•	material errors of law;
	•	demonstrable factual error;
	•	newly discovered evidence;
	•	constitutional violations affecting outcome.

Appeals shall not be granted for harmless procedural defects that do not affect guilt.

n. Finality of Truth
Once guilt is lawfully established through fair process and reliable evidence, justice shall proceed without delay.

Endless litigation shall not be used to exhaust victims or society.

Overly litigious individuals or organizations that establish a pattern of abusing the courts for obstruction or ill-gotten gain may be compelled to bear full court costs and sanctions.

o. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to elevate truth above technicality, justice above performance, and moral clarity above procedural cynicism.

As Scripture teaches:
“You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”

Section 4. Rights of Victims

a. Recognition of Victims
Victims of crime are persons against whom harm has been committed.

The justice system exists foremost to acknowledge, protect, and restore them.

Victims are not witnesses for the state alone; they are parties with inherent standing.

b. Right to Dignity and Protection
Victims shall be treated with dignity, respect, and seriousness at all stages of the criminal process.

They shall be protected from:
	•	intimidation;
	•	retaliation;
	•	public shaming;
	•	coercion;
	•	unnecessary exposure of private details.

The Republic owes safety to those already harmed.

c. Right to Information
Victims have the right to timely and truthful information regarding:
	•	charges filed or declined;
	•	court proceedings and schedules;
	•	plea negotiations;
	•	sentencing recommendations;
	•	incarceration status;
	•	release, transfer, or escape of offenders.

No material decision affecting a victim shall occur in secrecy.

d. Right to Participation
Victims shall have the right to:
	•	be heard at bail, plea, sentencing, and parole proceedings;
	•	submit impact statements;
	•	present evidence relevant to harm suffered;
	•	object to unjust leniency.

Victim input shall be considered, though it shall not substitute for lawful judgment.

e. Right to Restitution
Victims are entitled to full restitution for:
	•	physical injury;
	•	psychological harm;
	•	lost income or opportunity;
	•	medical and therapeutic expenses;
	•	property loss or destruction.

Restitution shall take priority over fines payable to the state.

f. Priority of Victim Claims
Any assets seized from offenders shall first be applied to victim restitution before state claims, fees, or administrative costs.

The offender owes the victim before owing the treasury.

g. Protection Against Procedural Evasion
No plea agreement, diversion program, or sentence reduction may be granted in heinous or violent crimes without:
	•	judicial findings on the record;
	•	notice to the victim;
	•	opportunity for victim objection.

Victims shall not be silenced for convenience.

h. Special Protections for Vulnerable Victims
Victims who are minors, disabled persons, or victims of sexual or violent crimes shall receive:
	•	trauma-informed procedures;
	•	privacy protections;
	•	specialized advocates;
	•	shielded testimony where appropriate.

Protection shall not undermine truth-seeking.

i. Right to Timely Justice
Victims have the right to resolution without unreasonable delay.

Intentional delay tactics designed to exhaust or silence victims constitute abuse of process.

j. Right to Appeal Certain Decisions
Victims may seek review of:
	•	dismissal of charges;
	•	non-prosecution agreements;
	•	plea agreements in violent or predatory crimes;
	•	parole or early release decisions.

Such review shall be limited, expedited, and narrowly tailored.

k. State Duty of Care
The Republic shall provide victims with:
	•	access to counseling and medical care;
	•	legal assistance where necessary;
	•	relocation or protection services when threatened.

Justice does not end at conviction.

l. No Retaliatory Liability
Victims shall not be subject to civil or criminal liability for:
	•	reporting crimes in good faith;
	•	cooperating with lawful prosecution;
	•	providing testimony.

False reporting made with malicious intent remains punishable.

m. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to restore balance between the rights of the accused and the rights of those harmed, recognizing that justice fails when victims are reduced to procedural afterthoughts.

As Scripture teaches:
“Open your mouth for the mute, for the rights of all who are destitute.”

Section 5. Sentencing Philosophy and Proportional Punishment

a. Purpose of Sentencing
Sentencing exists to:
	•	protect the innocent;
	•	restrain the dangerous;
	•	restore victims where possible;
	•	punish wrongdoing proportionately;
	•	reinforce moral order and public trust.

No sentence shall be imposed solely to satisfy ideology, public outrage, or bureaucratic convenience.

b. Proportionality
Punishment shall be proportional to:
	•	the severity of harm caused;
	•	the intent of the offender;
	•	the degree of culpability;
	•	the risk of future harm;
	•	the offender’s history.

Minor crimes shall not receive major punishments,
and major crimes shall not receive minor ones.

c. Alignment With the Three Tiers of Justice
All sentences shall explicitly correspond to one of the three tiers:
	•	Tier One: therapeutic and restorative measures;
	•	Tier Two: rehabilitative incarceration with restitution and labor;
	•	Tier Three: punitive incapacitation for heinous or incorrigible offenders.

Courts shall state on the record the tier applied and the justification for placement.

d. Individualized Sentencing
Sentencing shall be individualized, accounting for:
	•	facts of the offense;
	•	offender history;
	•	victim impact;
	•	prospects for rehabilitation;
	•	public safety needs.

Mandatory sentencing schemes that eliminate judicial judgment are disfavored,
except for heinous crimes where minimum incapacitation is required.

e. Severity for Heinous Crimes
Crimes involving:
	•	murder;
	•	rape;
	•	sexual exploitation of children;
	•	human trafficking;
	•	extreme or repeated violence;

shall receive sentences prioritizing incapacitation over rehabilitation.

Leniency in such cases requires extraordinary justification and explicit findings.

f. Rehabilitation as a Conditional Privilege
Rehabilitation is not an entitlement.

It is earned through:
	•	demonstrated accountability;
	•	compliance with programs;
	•	measurable behavioral change;
	•	sustained good conduct.

Failure to engage in rehabilitation shall result in escalation of confinement conditions or tier placement.

g. Restitution as a Core Component
Where feasible, sentencing shall include mandatory restitution.

Labor, wages, and assets of the offender may be applied toward restitution.

Restitution obligations survive release.

h. Truthful Sentencing
Sentences shall be imposed honestly and transparently.

Artificially inflated maximums paired with routine early release are forbidden.

If a sentence is imposed, it shall be meant.

i. Parole and Early Release
Parole or early release may be granted only when:
	•	public safety is not compromised;
	•	restitution obligations are substantially met;
	•	the offender demonstrates sustained reform.

Parole is prohibited for Tier Three offenders except under extraordinary judicial review.

j. Review and Adjustment
Sentences may be reviewed periodically to:
	•	assess rehabilitation;
	•	correct demonstrable error;
	•	address new evidence;
	•	respond to changes in dangerousness.

Review shall not become a revolving door.

k. Equality Before Sentencing
Sentencing shall not vary based on:
	•	race;
	•	sex;
	•	wealth;
	•	political status;
	•	ideology;
	•	office or influence.

Justice is blind to status, not to facts.

l. Public Accountability
Sentencing data shall be published in anonymized form to ensure:
	•	consistency;
	•	proportionality;
	•	public confidence;
	•	detection of systemic abuse.

m. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to ensure that punishment restores order without cruelty, protects society without indulgence, and reflects moral seriousness without vindictiveness.

n. Right to Trial and Limits on Coercive Plea Bargaining
Every accused person retains the right to a public trial for any criminal offense, except for minor civil infractions expressly designated by law.

No person shall be coerced into confessing guilt through:
	•	threat of disproportionate sentencing;
	•	stacking of charges to induce fear;
	•	denial of access to trial;
	•	use of pretrial detention as leverage.

Trials exist to discover truth, not to extort admissions.

o. Prohibition on Charge Manipulation
Prosecutors may not reduce, dismiss, or substitute charges in a manner that:
	•	conceals the true nature of the offense;
	•	misrepresents the harm committed;
	•	reclassifies violent or predatory crimes as minor offenses;
	•	permits offenders to evade proportional accountability.

Accordingly, reductions such as:
	•	rape pleaded down to assault;
	•	armed robbery pleaded down to petty theft;
	•	child sexual offenses pleaded down to non-sexual crimes;
	•	trafficking pleaded down to regulatory violations;

are forbidden.

Charges must reflect reality.

p. Narrow Scope of Permissible Plea Agreements
Plea agreements may be permitted only when:
	•	the underlying facts remain accurately charged;
	•	victim rights under Section 4 are preserved;
	•	sentencing remains within the appropriate tier;
	•	judicial findings justify the agreement on the record.

Plea agreements exist to conserve resources, not to distort justice.

q. Mandatory Judicial Review of Pleas
All plea agreements require:
	•	explicit judicial findings of factual sufficiency;
	•	confirmation that the defendant was not coerced;
	•	confirmation that the victim was notified and heard where applicable;
	•	confirmation that the plea does not undermine public safety.

Judges serve as guardians against prosecutorial abuse.

r. Right to Appeal
Every criminal conviction, whether by trial or plea, is subject to appeal on grounds including:
	•	material legal error;
	•	violation of constitutional rights;
	•	newly discovered evidence;
	•	demonstrable coercion or misconduct.

No conviction shall be insulated from review.

s. Interpretation
This subsection shall be interpreted to restore the trial as the central instrument of justice, restrain prosecutorial overreach, and prevent the use of fear as a substitute for proof.

As Scripture teaches:
“Justice is turned back, and righteousness stands far away.”

t. Inviolability of Constitutional Minimums and Tier Three Terms
No statute, regulation, policy, administrative action, credit system, good-time allowance, earned release program, or other mechanism may reduce time actually served below:
	•	the constitutional mandatory minimum floors established in Section 12(l);
	•	the full term required for Tier Three punitive incapacitation, except upon extraordinary judicial review as provided in Section 6.

This prohibition includes any prospective or retroactive credits unrelated to demonstrable medical necessity certified by at least two independent physicians and approved by judicial order after victim notice and opportunity to object.

Violations constitute official misconduct.

Section 5-A. Optional State Corporal Sanctions In lieu of Short-Term Confinement (Stub)

A State may, by statute, permit narrowly defined corporal sanctions as an alternative to short-term confinement for eligible offenses, subject to the following constitutional limits:

a. Scope. A State may authorize such sanctions only for offenses designated eligible by law that are not Tier Three, not sexual, not violent, and not predatory. A State shall exclude offenses whose primary driver is addiction or mental incapacity where Tier One therapeutic justice better serves public safety.

b. Election. No court may impose a corporal sanction unless the convicted person knowingly and voluntarily elects it in writing as an alternative to a defined custodial term, after counsel, and after the court states the custodial alternative on the record.

c. Cruelty Prohibited. A State shall prohibit any method that constitutes torture, degradation, lasting injury, sexual humiliation, or excessive pain. A State shall set objective maxima by law and shall require medical screening and medical supervision.

d. Transparency and Record. The proceeding and the sanction shall be recorded and preserved. A State shall maintain auditable data on frequency, demographics, error, injury, and recidivism effects.

e. No Evasion. A State may not use corporal sanctions to evade constitutional sentencing floors, tier requirements, or victim rights under this Article.


Section 5-B. Definition of Excessive Pain; Anti-Degradation Safeguards

a. Excessive Pain (Objective Standard).
For purposes of this Article, “Excessive Pain” means pain or suffering imposed by a punishment that, in method, intensity, duration, repetition, or conditions, creates a substantial risk of, or results in, any of the following:
	1. lasting physical injury or impairment, including scarring, nerve injury, infection, or persistent loss of function;
	2. medically significant complications, prolonged incapacity, or sustained inability to ambulate or perform ordinary bodily functions beyond a brief recovery period defined by law;
	3. disproportionate intensity relative to the offense and the definite custodial alternative stated on the record;
	4. a purpose or design to degrade, terrorize, sexually humiliate, or publicly shame, rather than to impose a bounded sanction;
	5. imposition despite medical contraindication or without required medical screening and supervision;
	6. arbitrary escalation, retaliatory use, or repetition beyond statutory maxima.

The Legislature shall codify objective limits, prohibited methods, medical exclusions, documentation requirements, and independent auditing sufficient to prevent cruelty, to maintain proportionality, and to avoid arbitrary administration.

b. Non-Degradation; No Public Spectacle.
A State that authorizes any corporal alternative under Section 5-A shall prohibit public spectacle, forced public exposure, sexual humiliation, or any practice designed to degrade. The election and administration of the sanction shall occur outside public view except as necessary for security, medical supervision, and lawful recording.

c. Neutral Nomenclature; Records.
A State shall use neutral legal terminology for such sanctions in charging, sentencing, and record systems. Records of an elected corporal alternative shall be recorded and preserved for oversight, and may be sealed from general public disclosure by default, subject to lawful access for courts, oversight bodies, and background checks for positions of public trust as defined by law.

d. Voluntary Election Protected.
No person shall be punished, retaliated against, or subjected to harsher sentencing for declining a corporal alternative. Any election shall be knowingly and voluntarily made in writing after counsel, and the court shall state the custodial alternative on the record.

Section 6. Heinous Crimes and Permanent Protection of Society

a. Definition of Heinous Crimes
Heinous crimes are offenses that demonstrate extreme moral culpability, predatory intent, or irreversible harm to persons or the Republic.

Such crimes include, but are not limited to:
	•	murder or attempted murder;
	•	rape or aggravated sexual assault;
	•	sexual exploitation or abuse of children;
	•	human trafficking or forced sexual labor;
	•	torture;
	•	genocide or crimes against humanity;
	•	terrorism or mass-casualty violence;
	•	repeated acts of severe violence;
	•	predatory crimes demonstrating sadism, domination, or contempt for human dignity.

The defining feature of a heinous crime is not merely severity, but the revelation of a will fundamentally hostile to social order.

b. Presumption of Tier Three Placement
Conviction for a heinous crime creates a rebuttable presumption of Tier Three punitive incapacitation.

Rebuttal is permitted only upon:
	•	extraordinary mitigating evidence;
	•	unanimous judicial findings;
	•	written justification entered into the public record;
	•	consideration of victim input.

The burden rests on the offender.

c. No Leniency by Convenience
Heinous crimes shall not be resolved through:
	•	charge reduction disguising the offense;
	•	diversion programs;
	•	deferred prosecution;
	•	symbolic sentencing;
	•	routine parole eligibility.

Administrative efficiency shall never outweigh public safety or moral clarity.

d. Permanent or Long-Term Incapacitation
Sentences for heinous crimes shall prioritize:
	•	lifelong confinement; or
	•	confinement for a term sufficient to protect society for the offender’s natural life.

Release, if ever permitted, requires extraordinary judicial review and proof that danger no longer exists.

e. Conditions of Confinement
Tier Three confinement shall:
	•	be secure, austere, and disciplined;
	•	deny privileges unrelated to basic human survival;
	•	require compulsory labor where physically possible;
	•	prohibit indulgences or luxuries;
	•	permit only limited contact with the outside world.

Conditions shall be harsh but not cruel.

f. No Presumption of Rehabilitation
Rehabilitation is not presumed for heinous offenders.

Participation in programs does not entitle an offender to release, reduced sentence, or reclassification absent compelling proof of transformation and safety.

g. Victim and Community Priority
In all decisions concerning heinous offenders, the safety, dignity, and peace of victims and the community shall take precedence over offender comfort or speculative reform.

h. Truthful Sentencing and Public Record
All sentences imposed for heinous crimes shall:
	•	reflect the true gravity of the offense;
	•	be publicly recorded;
	•	be immune from silent reduction or administrative erosion.

Justice shall be visible.

i. Expert Concurrence Requirement for Any Release Consideration
No Tier Three offender convicted of a heinous crime may be considered for release unless, in addition to all other requirements of this Section, the court receives concurrent written findings from two independent experts in criminology who:
	•	are appointed separately by the court;
	•	conduct their evaluations independently, without communication or coordination with one another;
	•	conclude, to a reasonable professional certainty, that:
	•	the offender no longer poses a threat to the public; and
	•	release will not foreseeably result in harm to victims or new victims.

States may establish reasonable standards for qualifying experts, which shall include:
	•	substantial professional experience in criminology, forensic psychology, or a closely related field;
	•	an advanced degree or equivalent demonstrated expertise;
	•	a record of professional good standing;
	•	a demonstrated reputation for non-ideological judgment and ethical independence.

Expert findings are advisory only and shall not bind the court.
Failure of either expert to concur bars release consideration.

j. Review for Error, Not Mercy
Judicial review of heinous crime convictions is limited to:
	•	claims of factual innocence;
	•	demonstrable constitutional violation;
	•	newly discovered exculpatory evidence.

Review shall not exist to relitigate punishment based on sentiment.

k. Prohibition on Political Interference
No executive, legislative, or administrative authority may:
	•	commute sentences for heinous crimes as political acts;
	•	grant mass amnesties;
	•	override judicial findings for popularity or ideology.

Mercy belongs to God; protection belongs to the Republic.

l. Oathbreaking and Public Corruption
Oathbreaking, corruption, and betrayal of public trust constitute offenses against the Republic itself.

Such offenses include:
	•	willful violation of a sworn oath of office;
	•	corruption, bribery, or illicit enrichment while exercising public authority;
	•	abuse of power resulting in grave harm to persons, institutions, or constitutional order;
	•	deliberate subversion of elections, justice, or lawful governance;
	•	collusion with foreign powers or criminal enterprises;
	•	knowing suppression of truth to evade accountability.

These offenses may qualify as Tier Three crimes when:
	•	committed knowingly and maliciously;
	•	involving systemic harm or large-scale abuse;
	•	demonstrating contempt for constitutional duty;
	•	betraying the trust of the People.

Public office magnifies responsibility.
Betrayal of that trust magnifies guilt.

m. Presumption of Severity
Oathbreaking by senior officials creates a rebuttable presumption of Tier Three placement.

Mitigation requires:
	•	full disclosure;
	•	restitution;
	•	voluntary resignation;
	•	cooperation with prosecution;
	•	judicial findings entered into the public record.

n. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to ensure that those who demonstrate profound hostility to human dignity are restrained decisively, lawfully, and permanently where necessary.

As Scripture teaches:
“Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed.”
“To whom much is given, much will be required.”
Section 7. Restitution, Labor, and Indentured Punishment

a. Principle of Restitution
Justice requires that offenders repay the harm they cause. Where possible, restitution to victims shall take precedence over punishment to the state.

b. Mandatory Restitution
Courts shall order restitution for:
	•	physical injury;
	•	psychological harm;
	•	lost wages or opportunity;
	•	medical and therapeutic costs;
	•	property loss or destruction.

Restitution obligations survive incarceration and release.

c. Priority of Victims
All offender assets, wages, and labor value shall be applied in the following order:
	•	victim restitution;
	•	court-ordered civil liabilities;
	•	public costs incurred by the offense.

The offender owes the victim before the treasury.

d. Compulsory Labor
Offenders under Tier Two or Tier Three confinement shall be required to perform labor where physically and mentally capable.

Labor shall be:
	•	productive and socially useful;
	•	safe but demanding;
	•	supervised and disciplined;
	•	compensated at rates set by law.

Refusal to labor without medical justification constitutes misconduct and may escalate confinement conditions.

e. Indentured Punishment for Restitution
Courts may impose periods of restitution-based indentured service to repay victims and society.

Such service:
	•	shall not exceed seven years for non-heinous crimes;
	•	shall be capped proportionally to harm caused;
	•	shall include humane treatment and basic protections;
	•	shall prohibit physical cruelty or degradation.

Indentured punishment exists to repay debt, not to humiliate.

f. Extended Labor for Heinous or Incorrigible Offenders
Tier Three offenders may be assigned to extended or lifelong labor programs when:
	•	restitution remains unpaid;
	•	confinement is permanent;
	•	the offender is physically capable.

Labor under this subsection is punitive and incapacitative, not rehabilitative.

g. Stewardship Standards
All labor and indenture programs shall adhere to strict standards of stewardship, including:
	•	adequate food, shelter, and medical care;
	•	protection from arbitrary violence;
	•	prohibition on torture or experimentation;
	•	accountability of supervisors.

Cruelty corrupts justice.

h. No Profit Motive
No private entity may profit from forced labor. All labor programs shall be publicly administered or strictly regulated.

Justice shall not be commodified.

i. Accounting and Transparency
All restitution, labor output, and asset application shall be:
	•	documented;
	•	audited;
	•	disclosed to victims;
	•	subject to judicial review.

Hidden punishment is forbidden.

j. Completion and Release
Completion of restitution obligations may be considered in parole or reclassification decisions for Tier Two offenders.

No completion of labor entitles a Tier Three offender to release.

k. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to restore victims, reinforce accountability, and ensure that punishment repays harm rather than merely warehousing offenders.

As Scripture teaches:
“The wicked borrows and does not repay, but the righteous is generous and just.”

Section 8. Wrongful Convictions and Just Compensation

a. Recognition of Wrongful Conviction
A wrongful conviction occurs when a person is convicted and punished for a crime they did not commit, or when conviction is obtained through material falsehood, suppression of exculpatory evidence, or grave misconduct that corrupts the truth-finding process.

The Republic bears moral and legal responsibility for such failures.

b. Right to Exoneration
Any person wrongfully convicted has the right to:
	•	formal exoneration;
	•	vacatur of conviction;
	•	expungement of criminal records;
	•	public acknowledgment of error.

Justice requires restoration of truth, not quiet dismissal.

c. Mandatory Just Compensation
Upon exoneration, the convicting authority shall compensate the wrongfully convicted person for:
	•	all lost wages and reasonably projected lifetime earnings;
	•	loss of professional advancement or career opportunity;
	•	confiscated or forfeited property;
	•	legal costs incurred in defense and appeal;
	•	medical and psychological harm suffered during confinement;
	•	loss of liberty, reputation, and family stability.

Compensation shall be paid promptly and may not be capped arbitrarily.

d. Income and Property Calculation
Compensation shall be determined by an objective algorithm considering:
	•	age at conviction;
	•	education and skills;
	•	employment history;
	•	regional wage standards;
	•	length of confinement;
	•	documented property loss.

Where precise calculation is impossible, courts shall err in favor of the wrongfully convicted.

e. No Waiver of Rights
Acceptance of compensation shall not require:
	•	waiver of civil claims;
	•	nondisclosure agreements;
	•	silence regarding misconduct;
	•	release of liability for officials.

Truth may not be purchased.

f. Mandatory Investigation of Malpractice
Upon exoneration, an automatic investigation shall be initiated into:
	•	prosecutorial misconduct;
	•	police misconduct;
	•	forensic fraud;
	•	judicial abuse or dereliction;
	•	suppression or fabrication of evidence.

Exoneration triggers accountability.

g. Criminal and Professional Liability
Any official found to have:
	•	knowingly lied;
	•	suppressed exculpatory evidence;
	•	fabricated evidence;
	•	coerced false testimony;
	•	abused authority to secure conviction;

shall face:
	•	criminal prosecution;
	•	permanent disqualification from public office;
	•	loss of professional licensure;
	•	Tier Three consideration where harm is severe.

Lawyers are not exempt from truth.

h. No Sovereign Immunity
The Republic, States, and subdivisions may not invoke sovereign immunity to avoid liability for wrongful conviction.

The state answers for its injustice.

i. Timeliness of Review
Claims of wrongful conviction shall receive expedited judicial review when supported by:
	•	new evidence;
	•	recanted testimony;
	•	forensic advances;
	•	proof of misconduct.

Delay compounds injustice.

j. Compensation Funding
Compensation shall be paid by:
	•	the convicting jurisdiction;
	•	a mandatory justice liability fund;
	•	personal liability where misconduct is proven.

The cost of injustice shall not be externalized to the innocent.

k. Post-Release Support
The wrongfully convicted shall receive:
	•	immediate access to housing;
	•	medical and psychological care;
	•	vocational and educational assistance;
	•	record restoration services.

Freedom without support is hollow.

l. Finality and Truth
Exoneration based on truth shall be final.
No authority may re-prosecute absent genuinely new and compelling evidence.

m. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to ensure that the Republic does not merely free the innocent, but actively repairs the harm done in its name.

As Scripture teaches:
“Woe to those who acquit the guilty for a bribe, and deprive the innocent of his right.”
Section 9. Mental Incapacity, Civil Confinement, and Dangerousness

a. Distinction Between Crime and Incapacity
Mental illness, cognitive impairment, addiction, or psychological disorder shall not be treated as crimes in themselves.

However, such conditions do not excuse conduct that causes grave harm unless they genuinely negate the capacity to understand or control one’s actions.

The law shall distinguish illness from evil, without confusing either.

b. Standards for Mental Incapacity
A finding of mental incapacity requires clear and convincing evidence that, at the time of the offense, the accused:
	•	lacked the capacity to understand the nature or wrongfulness of the act; or
	•	lacked the capacity to control conduct despite understanding it.

For purposes of this Article, ‘person’ includes any human or non-human person recognized under Article XXVI, Section 9, with confinement, suspension, dormancy, trusteeship, or control-transfer substituted where incarceration is inapplicable.
 Personality disorders, ideological beliefs, moral indifference, or voluntary intoxication do not constitute incapacity.

c. Insanity Defense Limits
The insanity defense shall be narrowly construed and applied only where true incapacity is proven.

Successful invocation of insanity does not entitle the offender to freedom.

Protection of the public remains paramount.

d. Civil Confinement for Dangerous Individuals
Where a person is found:
	•	mentally incapacitated, and
	•	likely to pose a continuing danger to self or others,

the court shall order civil confinement in a secure medical facility.

Civil confinement is protective, not punitive.
For purposes of this Section, ‘person’ includes any human or non-human person recognized under Article XXVI, Section 9, with confinement, suspension, dormancy, or trusteeship substituted where incarceration is inapplicable.

e. Conditions of Civil Confinement
Civil confinement facilities shall:
	•	provide humane medical and psychological care;
	•	impose security measures proportionate to risk;
	•	prohibit punishment unrelated to safety;
	•	prevent exploitation or neglect.

Treatment shall be real, not symbolic.

f. Duration and Review (Strengthened Standard)
Civil confinement shall continue only so long as the individual poses a continuing danger to self or others, proven by clear and convincing evidence at mandatory judicial reviews conducted no less than annually.

Each review shall require:
	•	independent forensic evaluations by at least two qualified professionals unaffiliated with the confining facility;
	•	explicit assessment of the risk of relapse into criminal conduct identical or substantially similar to the original offense;
	•	consideration of victim impact statements where applicable.

Release requires affirmative proof that danger has abated to a degree consistent with public safety. Completion of treatment programs, medication compliance, behavioral improvement, or time served alone is insufficient.

g. No Automatic or Technical Release
No individual shall be released from civil confinement based solely on:
	•	completion of prescribed treatment protocols;
	•	expiration of a predetermined term;
	•	administrative determination without judicial findings;
	•	claims of “cure” absent independent verification of non-dangerousness.

Any release decision must include written judicial findings entered into the public record, with immediate appeal rights for victims and the state.

h. Transition and Supervision
Where release is granted, courts may impose:
	•	supervised reintegration;
	•	treatment compliance requirements;
	•	monitoring proportionate to risk.

Conditions shall not function as punishment.

i. Prohibition on Punitive Disguises
Civil confinement may not be used:
	•	to impose punishment without conviction;
	•	to bypass criminal procedure;
	•	to warehouse inconvenient individuals;
	•	as a substitute for sentencing.

Abuse of civil confinement is a constitutional violation.

j. Protection Against Political or Ideological Abuse
No person may be declared mentally incapacitated or dangerous based on:
	•	political belief;
	•	religious belief;
	•	dissenting opinion;
	•	lawful speech;
	•	cultural nonconformity.

Such acts constitute tyranny.

k. Rights of the Confined
Persons civilly confined retain:
	•	the right to counsel;
	•	the right to challenge confinement;
	•	the right to humane treatment;
	•	access to courts and records.

Illness does not erase humanity.

l. Interaction With the Three Tiers
Mental incapacity determinations may:
	•	divert eligible offenders to Tier One treatment;
	•	justify civil confinement in lieu of punishment;
	•	delay but not erase criminal accountability if capacity is later restored.

Restoration of capacity may permit resumption of criminal proceedings where appropriate.

m. Prohibition on Release Into Known Harm
No individual shall be released from confinement—civil or criminal—into conditions that foreseeably:
	•	provoke relapse;
	•	place others at unreasonable risk;
	•	recreate the circumstances of prior harm.

The Republic shall not manufacture recidivism.

n. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to protect the innocent, treat illness honestly, restrain the dangerous, and prevent the misuse of compassion as a pathway to further harm.

Section 9A. Probation, Parole, and Sentence Reduction

a. Purpose
Probation and parole exist to support reintegration, reduce recidivism, and reward demonstrated rehabilitation.
They shall not function as substitutes for adjudication, punishment, or deterrence.

b. General Rule
Any sentence of incarceration imposed by a court shall be presumed to be served substantially as imposed.

Early release is an exception, not an expectation.

c. Trial Convictions
For offenses resulting in conviction after a full trial:
	•	probation, parole, or supervised release may reduce no more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the imposed custodial sentence;
	•	no reduction may occur absent documented compliance, rehabilitation progress, and risk assessment;
	•	reductions shall be earned, not automatic.

d. Plea Agreements
For offenses resolved by plea agreement:
	•	probation or parole may reduce no more than fifty percent (50%) of the imposed custodial sentence;
	•	plea agreements may not waive statutory or constitutional minimums;
	•	plea terms must be disclosed on the record and subject to judicial approval;
	•	charge reductions may not mischaracterize the nature of the offense.

e. Prohibition for Tier Three Offenses
Probation, parole, early release, or sentence reduction shall not apply to Tier Three crimes.

Sentences imposed for Tier Three offenses shall be served in full, except where overturned on appeal or corrected for error.

f. No Administrative Override
No correctional agency, parole board, or executive authority may exceed the limits established herein.

Any attempt to circumvent sentencing limits constitutes abuse of authority.

g. Truth-in-Sentencing
All sentences shall be communicated to the defendant, victims, and the public as real time to be served, exclusive of speculative reductions.

Misrepresentation of sentence duration is prohibited.

h. Deterrence Principle
Sentencing practices shall be guided by the principles of certainty, proportionality, and truthfulness.

Punishment must be known, predictable, and meaningful to deter crime and uphold justice.

i. Exemplary Conduct Credit (Tier Two Only)
For offenders classified under Tier Two, the sentencing court may, upon motion and after notice to victims, grant a reduction of custodial time for extraordinary and exemplary conduct, subject to the following conditions:
	•	Any reduction granted under this subsection shall:
a. be no less than ten percent (10%) and
b. not exceed the maximum reduction otherwise permitted under subsections (c) or (d) of this Section;
c. not expand, stack upon, or circumvent the caps established herein.
	•	Exemplary conduct shall require affirmative judicial findings, supported by clear evidence, that the offender has:
a. completed required educational, vocational, therapeutic, or labor programs in advance of schedule and to a demonstrably high standard;
b. made substantial or complete progress toward restitution obligations;
c. maintained sustained institutional conduct exceeding baseline compliance; and
d. contributed positively to institutional order, safety, or rehabilitation of others.
Mere rule compliance or passage of time shall be insufficient.
	•	Any reduction under this subsection:
a. shall be granted only by judicial order;
b. shall require written findings entered into the public record;
c. shall include a determination that public safety will not be compromised.
	•	This subsection shall not apply to Tier Three offenders, offenders convicted of heinous crimes, or offenders subject to recidivism escalation triggering Tier Three presumptions.
	•	No correctional agency, parole board, or administrative authority may grant, calculate, or apply exemplary conduct credit absent an express court order under this subsection.

j. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to prevent coercive plea practices, eliminate illusory sentencing, and ensure that justice is neither theatrical nor hollow.

As it is written:
“Let your ‘yes’ be yes, and your ‘no’ be no.”

Section 9B. Recidivism Escalation and Habitual Offenders

a. Purpose
The Republic recognizes that repeated violent or predatory conduct demonstrates diminished amenability to rehabilitation and heightened risk to the public. Recidivism shall result in predictable escalation of consequences.

b. Definition of Qualifying Recidivism
A qualifying offense for escalation is any felony involving:
	•	violence against persons;
	•	sexual exploitation or assault;
	•	use of a deadly weapon;
	•	coercion, trafficking, or predation;
	•	serious bodily harm or credible threat thereof.

Only convictions adjudicated with full due process shall qualify.

c. Second Qualifying Offense
Upon conviction of a second qualifying offense:
	•	eligibility for probation or parole shall be reduced by one-half of the otherwise applicable cap;
	•	mandatory supervision, treatment, and monitoring shall be imposed upon release;
	•	judicial findings on public risk shall be entered on the record.

Leniency becomes exceptional after repetition.

d. Third Qualifying Offense — Presumption of Tier Three
Upon conviction of a third qualifying offense:
	•	the offender shall be presumptively classified as Tier Three;
	•	probation, parole, and early release are prohibited;
	•	incapacitative sentencing is authorized;
	•	the sentence shall be served in full, subject only to appeal or correction of error.

The presumption may be rebutted only by unanimous judicial finding of extraordinary circumstances, stated in writing.

e. Prohibition on Charge Manipulation
Qualifying offenses may not be reclassified, downgraded, subdivided, or otherwise altered to avoid recidivism escalation.

Any attempt to evade escalation through charge manipulation constitutes prosecutorial misconduct.

f. Temporal Scope
Convictions shall remain qualifying for escalation purposes regardless of time elapsed, except where:
	•	the prior offense was nonviolent;
	•	the offender was a juvenile;
	•	the conviction was vacated or expunged.

Violence does not expire by passage of time alone.

g. Due Process Protections
Recidivism escalation shall apply only where:
	•	prior convictions are proven on the record;
	•	the defendant is afforded opportunity to contest qualification;
	•	judicial findings are made explicitly and publicly.

h. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to protect the innocent, restrain the incorrigible, and ensure that repeated violence meets firm and predictable consequences.

As it is written:
“Persistent wrongdoing invites sterner judgment.”

i. Prohibition on Evasion of Escalation
No authority, including prosecutors, courts, correctional officials, or administrative agencies, may evade recidivism escalation, Tier Three presumption, or mandatory minimum applicability by:
	•	processing a qualifying offense solely as a parole, probation, or supervised release violation;
	•	reclassifying, subdividing, amending, or otherwise altering charges to a misdemeanor, non-qualifying felony, or lesser offense when the conduct meets the definition of a qualifying offense;
	•	entering into any agreement, stipulation, or plea that omits, contradicts, minimizes, or factually bargains away elements establishing qualification for escalation or Tier Three placement.

Any such action constitutes grave official misconduct subject to separate prosecution under Section 3(e) and potential Tier Three classification.

j. Indefinite Temporal Effect of Qualifying Convictions
Qualifying prior convictions shall remain effective for recidivism escalation and Tier Three purposes indefinitely, regardless of time elapsed since the prior offense, unless the conviction was vacated, expunged, or expressly designated non-qualifying by this Constitution.
k. Where incarceration is impracticable
Where incarceration is impracticable, courts may impose proportional sanctions including enforced dormancy, instance sequestration, network isolation, transfer of operational control, trusteeship, or equivalent measures consistent with public safety and constitutional dignity.

Juvenile adjudications may be considered only as provided in Section 11.

Section 10. Clemency, Mercy, and Restoration

a. Purpose of Clemency
Clemency exists as a safeguard against injustice, not as an instrument of favoritism, political expediency, or sentimentality. It serves to correct error, acknowledge genuine repentance, and restore those who no longer pose a threat to the Republic.

Mercy must never defeat justice, but justice without mercy must never become cruelty.

b. Forms of Clemency
Clemency may take the form of:
	•	commutation of sentence;
	•	pardon;
	•	conditional release;
	•	restoration of civil standing for eligible offenses.

Each form shall be narrowly defined by law and exercised sparingly.

c. Limits on Executive Clemency
Clemency may not be granted:
	•	to conceal corruption;
	•	to shield political allies;
	•	to reward loyalty or silence;
	•	to nullify lawful convictions for heinous crimes;
	•	in bulk or blanket form.

No President may issue mass pardons or categorical amnesties.

d. Exclusion of Heinous and Tier Three Crimes
Clemency shall not apply to Tier Three offenses involving:
	•	murder;
	•	rape;
	•	child exploitation;
	•	human trafficking;
	•	terrorism;
	•	crimes against the Republic;
	•	egregious public corruption;
	•	oathbreaking resulting in grave harm.

Exception may exist only upon unanimous judicial review by a specially convened tribunal and written findings of extraordinary circumstances entered into the public record.

e. Judicial Review Requirement
All grants of clemency shall be subject to post-issuance judicial review to determine:
	•	legality;
	•	compliance with constitutional limits;
	•	absence of corruption or abuse;
	•	consistency with the tiered justice framework.

A clemency act found unconstitutional is void.

f. Clemency Review Board
A permanent Clemency Review Board shall exist, composed of:
	•	retired judges;
	•	forensic psychologists;
	•	victim advocates;
	•	correctional experts.

The Board shall:
	•	review petitions;
	•	assess rehabilitation;
	•	evaluate risk;
	•	issue non-binding recommendations.

The Executive may not grant clemency without a published review by this Board.

g. Victim Participation
Victims or their families shall be:
	•	notified of clemency petitions;
	•	permitted to submit statements;
	•	informed of decisions with reasons given.

Victims may not veto clemency, but their testimony shall carry substantial weight.

h. Restoration After Completion of Sentence
For Tier One offenses, upon full completion of sentence and requirements:
	•	civil standing shall be restored;
	•	records shall be sealed from public access;
	•	criminal history shall remain accessible only to courts and law enforcement;
	•	no collateral punishment may persist by default.

Time served is time served.

i. Conditional Restoration for Tier Two
Tier Two offenders may seek restoration of limited civil rights upon:
	•	verified rehabilitation;
	•	demonstrated restitution;
	•	absence of recidivism;
	•	psychological clearance.

Restoration is earned, not presumed.

j. Prohibition on Permanent Civil Death
No person may be rendered permanently rightless except where constitutionally authorized for Tier Three incapacitation.

Civil death is incompatible with a just Republic.

k. Clemency Transparency
All clemency actions shall be:
	•	published;
	•	archived;
	•	accompanied by written justification;
	•	subject to legislative oversight;
	•	available under the constitutional Right to Public Information.

Secrecy in mercy breeds corruption.

l. Clemency for Defense Counsel Exposing Grave Post-Acquittal Danger
A defense attorney who, after acquittal, becomes aware of verifiable, independently corroborable information demonstrating that a person acquitted of a Tier Three or heinous offense poses a continuing and extreme danger to the public may disclose such information in good faith under the following conditions:
	•	Disclosure shall be made only to a court of competent jurisdiction or to a specially designated judicial officer, under seal where necessary to protect due process.
	•	The information disclosed must:
a. be independently verifiable; or
b. be necessary to prevent imminent or grave future harm where no less intrusive lawful alternative exists.
	•	Disclosure under this subsection:
a. shall not constitute professional misconduct;
b. shall not give rise to criminal or civil liability;
c. shall not be deemed a waiver of attorney–client privilege beyond the specific information disclosed.
	•	This subsection shall not authorize retroactive punishment for the acquitted offense, but may support:
a. initiation of new proceedings based on new evidence;
b. lawful civil confinement under Section 9 where criteria are met;
c. protective or monitoring measures consistent with due process.
	•	Disclosure motivated by malice, fabrication, or political purpose remains punishable.

No officer of the court shall be compelled to live with knowledge of grave danger to the innocent when lawful disclosure may prevent it.

m. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to preserve:
	•	justice over sentiment,
	•	mercy over vengeance,
	•	restoration over perpetual punishment,
	•	and accountability over political indulgence.

As it is written:
“Justice and mercy have kissed; let neither be abandoned.”

Section 11. Juvenile Justice and Age-Based Culpability

a. Principle of Developmental Accountability
The Republic recognizes that children and adolescents possess developing judgment, impulse control, and moral reasoning. Accordingly, juvenile justice shall account for immaturity without excusing serious harm.

Youth mitigates culpability, but does not erase responsibility.

b. Definition of Juvenile Status
A juvenile is a person under the age of eighteen at the time of the offense, unless otherwise provided by law for specific crimes.

Age shall be determined objectively and may not be manipulated to evade accountability.

c. Presumption of Rehabilitation
Juvenile offenders are presumed capable of rehabilitation, particularly for nonviolent offenses.

Juvenile justice shall prioritize:
	•	education;
	•	treatment;
	•	family involvement;
	•	moral formation;
	•	accountability appropriate to age.

Punishment that forecloses reform is disfavored for youth.

d. Limits of Leniency
Juvenile status does not excuse:
	•	murder;
	•	rape or aggravated sexual assault;
	•	armed robbery;
	•	terrorism;
	•	repeated violent offenses;
	•	predatory conduct demonstrating adult-level intent.

In such cases, courts may impose severe sanctions consistent with public safety.

e. Transfer to Adult Court
A juvenile may be tried as an adult only upon judicial finding that:
	•	the offense demonstrates adult-level intent or violence;
	•	the juvenile poses a continuing danger;
	•	juvenile dispositions are inadequate to protect the public;
	•	mitigation has been considered on the record.

Transfer shall never be automatic.

f. Sentencing of Juveniles Tried as Adults
Juveniles convicted in adult court shall receive sentences reflecting:
	•	seriousness of the offense;
	•	developmental capacity;
	•	potential for reform;
	•	protection of the public.

Life imprisonment without review is disfavored and subject to periodic judicial reassessment.

g. Conditions of Confinement
Juveniles shall not be confined with adult offenders except where necessary for safety and security.

Facilities housing juveniles shall emphasize:
	•	education;
	•	discipline;
	•	psychological care;
	•	moral instruction;
	•	preparation for lawful adulthood.

Abuse or neglect of juvenile detainees is a grave offense.

h. Rights of Juvenile Victims
Juvenile victims shall receive enhanced protections consistent with Section 4, including:
	•	trauma-informed procedures;
	•	privacy safeguards;
	•	specialized advocates;
	•	expedited proceedings.

Youth of the offender shall not eclipse youth of the victim.

i. Sealing and Expungement
Records of juvenile offenses shall be sealed upon completion of sentence or disposition, except where:
	•	the offense was violent;
	•	the offense was sexual;
	•	the offender was tried as an adult.

Sealing shall not erase judicial or law enforcement access.

j. Transition to Adulthood
Courts shall ensure that juveniles completing dispositions receive:
	•	educational placement;
	•	vocational training;
	•	mental health support;
	•	supervised reintegration where appropriate.

The goal is lawful adulthood, not permanent marginalization.

k. Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to balance mercy with responsibility, rehabilitation with restraint, and youth with justice.

As Scripture teaches:
“Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.”

Section 12. Mandatory Minimum Sentencing

a. Purpose and Limitation
Mandatory minimum sentences exist solely to ensure baseline protection of the public and moral clarity for the gravest offenses. They are exceptional safeguards, not general sentencing tools.

Mandatory minimums shall guarantee a floor of punishment, never dictate a ceiling.

b. Crimes Subject to Mandatory Minimums
Mandatory minimum sentences may be imposed only for the following offenses:
	•	murder or attempted murder;
	•	rape or aggravated sexual assault;
	•	sexual exploitation or abuse of children;
	•	human trafficking or forced labor;
	•	terrorism or mass-casualty violence;
	•	genocide or crimes against humanity;
	•	egregious public corruption or oathbreaking causing grave harm;
	•	repeat violent felony offenses demonstrating incorrigibility;
	•	Mass Financial Predation and Aggregated Economic Harm, where a person or coordinated group, acting with intent to defraud, deceive, or exploit, knowingly engages in conduct that:
a. causes aggregate financial harm exceeding an amount indexed annually to the national economy, defined as not less than 0.005% of Gross Domestic Product; or
b. extracts unlawful, deceptive, or coercive payments, fees, charges, or losses from ten thousand (10,000) or more persons, regardless of the per-person amount; or
c. systematically imposes small but unlawful losses through repetition, concealment, automation, or complexity, such that the conduct would be economically irrational if transparently disclosed to victims;
and where such harm results in widespread personal financial injury, loss of essential resources, or long-term economic insecurity not reasonably remediable through restitution alone;
	•	Institutional Fiduciary Betrayal and Exploitative Practices, where an individual or entity entrusted with fiduciary, custodial, managerial, or professional responsibility knowingly:
a. charges unlawful or deceptive fees;
b. sells knowingly defective, unsafe, adulterated, or fraudulent products or services;
c. uses unsafe ingredients, concealed risks, or falsified compliance; or
d. exploits informational asymmetry to impose harm victims cannot reasonably detect or avoid;
and where such conduct is systemic, repeated, or institutionalized, resulting in substantial harm to persons, families, or communities;
	•	Economic Sabotage and Deliberate Market Abuse, where intentional conduct, coordination, or manipulation is undertaken to:
a. destabilize essential markets, services, or supply chains;
b. exploit resulting harm for profit, leverage, or political power; or
c. impose widespread civilian economic harm functionally equivalent to a physical disaster;
	•	Systemic Laundering and Concealment of Predatory Proceeds, where financial instruments, corporate forms, trusts, shell entities, algorithms, or jurisdictional arbitrage are knowingly used to:
a. conceal, distribute, or legitimize proceeds derived from offenses described in subsections (9) through (11);
b. fragment liability to evade detection or accountability; or
c. externalize harm while privatizing gain;
	•	Data Exploitation and Harmful Transfer, where a person or entity knowingly sells, licenses, transfers, or provides access to personal, behavioral, biometric, financial, or communications data, and:
a. knows, or is willfully blind to the fact, that the recipient is likely to use such data for fraud, coercion, surveillance abuse, identity theft, extortion, manipulation, or other serious harm to persons; or
b. transfers such data to foreign entities, jurisdictions, or intermediaries lacking meaningful legal safeguards, where misuse is reasonably foreseeable; or
c. structures data transfers to evade domestic protections, oversight, or accountability;
liability under this subsection shall attach regardless of whether the data transfer is nominally lawful, where intent, knowledge, or deliberate indifference to foreseeable harm is established.

c. Prohibition on Mandatory Minimums for Nonviolent Offenses
Mandatory minimums are prohibited for:
	•	nonviolent drug possession;
	•	offenses driven primarily by addiction or mental illness;
	•	first-time nonviolent offenses;
	•	regulatory or economic violations absent predation, intent, and human harm.

The Republic shall not punish weakness as wickedness.

d. Judicial Findings and Tier Alignment
Any mandatory minimum sentence imposed shall:
	•	correspond to Tier Two or Tier Three placement;
	•	be accompanied by explicit judicial findings on the record;
	•	state the public-safety and moral-clarity justification served by the minimum.

Courts retain discretion above the minimum.

e. Prohibition on Prosecutorial Manipulation
Mandatory minimums may not be used to:
	•	coerce guilty pleas;
	•	threaten disproportionate punishment;
	•	stack charges to induce fear;
	•	circumvent the right to trial.

Any attempt to leverage mandatory minimums as bargaining tools constitutes prosecutorial misconduct.

f. Truth-in-Sentencing Requirement
Any mandatory minimum imposed shall represent real time to be served.

Artificial sentencing practices, including:
	•	inflated sentences paired with routine early release;
	•	nominal minimums routinely waived administratively;
	•	sentence credits that nullify the minimum;
are prohibited.

g. Limited Judicial Mitigation
Extraordinary mitigation below a mandatory minimum may occur only when:
	•	factual innocence of aggravating elements is proven;
	•	new exculpatory evidence emerges;
	•	constitutional violations materially affected sentencing;
	•	unanimous judicial findings justify departure.

All departures must be written, published, and subject to appeal.

h. No Administrative Override
No executive, correctional, or administrative authority may:
	•	suspend a mandatory minimum;
	•	convert it into a noncustodial sentence;
	•	nullify it through regulation or policy.

Only courts may alter sentences.

i. Review and Correction
Mandatory minimum sentences remain subject to:
	•	appellate review for legal error;
	•	correction upon proof of innocence;
	•	relief for unconstitutional application.

Mandatory does not mean infallible.

j. Prohibition on Expansion
No legislature, court, or agency may expand mandatory minimum sentencing to new offenses by statute, rule, or interpretation.

Expansion requires constitutional amendment.

k. Limitation, Indexing, and Judicial Findings for Economic and Data Crimes
Mandatory minimum sentencing under subsections (9) through (13) shall apply only where the court makes explicit findings, on the record, that:
	•	the conduct was intentional, predatory, and exploitative, not negligent, mistaken, or incidental;
	•	harm resulted to persons, not merely abstract markets or speculative losses;
	•	the defendant knowingly relied on scale, repetition, concealment, automation, complexity, or institutional distance to magnify harm or suppress resistance;
	•	prosecution is not based solely on technical regulatory violation absent demonstrable human harm; and
	•	the offense warrants Tier Three alignment under Section 2A or Section 6 due to moral culpability and danger to the Republic.

Economic thresholds referenced herein shall be indexed annually by statute to objective national economic indicators and may not be frozen, waived, or administratively altered.

Failure to make such findings prohibits application of mandatory minimums under these subsections.

l. Knowing Enablement Standard
For purposes of subsections (9) through (13), a person or entity shall be deemed to have acted with predatory intent where it knowingly provides, maintains, customizes, optimizes, or supports infrastructure, technology, hardware, software, data, or expertise, and knows or is willfully blind to the fact that such support is being used primarily to commit fraud, exploitation, surveillance abuse, or mass economic harm to persons.

Neutral provision of goods or services shall not suffice absent such knowledge, deliberate ignorance, or continued support after credible notice of misuse.

m. Limitation on Ordinary Commerce
Ordinary commercial transactions conducted in good faith, with meaningful consent, reasonable safeguards, and prompt termination upon credible notice of misuse, shall not give rise to liability under subsections (9) through (13).

n. Constitutional Minimum Floors
For offenses subject to mandatory minimum sentencing under this Section, no sentence may fall below the following constitutional floors:
	•	Murder (intentional): not less than 25 years of incarceration;
	•	Rape or aggravated sexual assault: not less than 15 years;
	•	Sexual exploitation of a child: not less than 20 years;
	•	Human trafficking involving coercion or minors: not less than 20 years;
	•	Terrorism or mass-casualty violence: not less than 25 years;
	•	Genocide or crimes against humanity: not less than 30 years;
	•	Egregious public corruption or oathbreaking causing grave harm: not less than 10 years;
	•	Repeat violent felony offenders (third qualifying offense): not less than 15 years.

No statute, regulation, plea agreement, or administrative action may reduce these floors. Legislatures may impose higher minimums consistent with proportionality and this Constitution.

As Scripture teaches:
“Do not move the ancient boundary stone set by your forefathers.”
Section 13. Oversight, Data, and AI Compliance

a. Independent Justice Oversight Board

A permanent, independent Justice Oversight Board shall be established to monitor the integrity, fairness, and effectiveness of the criminal justice system under this Article.

The Board shall be composed of individuals of demonstrated integrity and competence, including but not limited to:
	•	retired judges;
	•	former prosecutors and defense attorneys;
	•	criminologists;
	•	victim advocates;
	•	civil liberties experts;
	•	forensic and data integrity specialists.

No active political officeholder, active prosecutor, active law enforcement officer, or active corporate executive subject to criminal jurisdiction under this Article may serve on the Board.

b. Scope of Authority

The Justice Oversight Board shall have authority to:
	•	audit sentencing practices for tier compliance, proportionality, and consistency;
	•	review restitution enforcement effectiveness;
	•	monitor parole, probation, and sentence reduction decisions for compliance with statutory caps and prohibitions;
	•	review wrongful conviction data and compensation compliance;
	•	inspect confinement conditions for constitutional compliance;
	•	investigate systemic abuse, evasion, or corruption within justice institutions;
	•	issue binding corrective directives where constitutional violations are found, subject to judicial review.

c. Mandatory Public Reporting

The Board shall publish annual public reports, at minimum, detailing:
	•	tier placement statistics;
	•	sentence lengths and actual time served;
	•	parole and early-release grants and denials by tier;
	•	recidivism rates by offense category and tier;
	•	restitution ordered versus restitution collected;
	•	wrongful conviction claims, exonerations, and compensation paid;
	•	civil confinement placements and releases;
	•	prosecutorial misconduct findings and sanctions.

Reports shall be anonymized where necessary to protect victims and due process, but may not conceal systemic patterns, institutional failures, or aggregate outcomes.

d. Data Integrity and Transparency

All criminal justice data relied upon for policymaking, sentencing analysis, or oversight shall be:
	•	accurate;
	•	auditable;
	•	retained for no fewer than thirty years;
	•	protected against alteration, deletion, or concealment.

Intentional falsification, suppression, or manipulation of justice data constitutes grave official misconduct and shall be prosecuted as such.

e. AI and Algorithmic System Constraints

Artificial intelligence, algorithmic risk assessment tools, predictive policing systems, sentencing software, or similar technologies may be used only in an advisory capacity.

No AI system may:
	•	determine guilt or innocence;
	•	mandate tier placement;
	•	impose or reduce sentences;
	•	override judicial findings;
	•	deny parole, probation, or release.

f. Transparency and Auditability of AI Systems

Any AI or algorithmic system used in the criminal justice process must:
	•	be publicly documented;
	•	disclose inputs, outputs, error rates, and known limitations;
	•	permit independent audit and replication;
	•	be free from proprietary secrecy that prevents meaningful review.

Black-box systems are prohibited.

g. Human Accountability Requirement

All final decisions affecting liberty, confinement, punishment, or release must be made by accountable human decision-makers.

No official may evade responsibility by deferring to an algorithm, model, or automated recommendation.

h. Prohibition on Predictive Punishment

No person may be punished, confined, escalated in tier, or denied release based solely or primarily on:
	•	statistical risk profiles;
	•	group-based predictive models;
	•	demographic correlations;
	•	speculative future conduct.

Punishment must be grounded in proven conduct, adjudicated facts, and lawful findings.

i. Enforcement and Sanctions

Failure to comply with this Section, including obstruction of audits, falsification of data, or misuse of AI systems, constitutes:
	•	official misconduct;
	•	grounds for removal from office;
	•	criminal liability where harm results.

j. Interpretation

This Section shall be interpreted to ensure that justice remains visible, accountable, transparent, and human-governed, and that technology serves the law rather than replaces it.

Oversight is not distrust of justice; it is fidelity to it.

Section 14. Juvenile Justice and Age-Based Culpability

a. Principle of Developmental Accountability

The Republic recognizes that children and adolescents possess developing judgment, impulse control, and moral reasoning. Juvenile justice shall account for immaturity without excusing serious harm.

Youth mitigates culpability, but does not erase responsibility.

b. Definition of Juvenile Status

A juvenile is a person under the age of eighteen at the time of the offense, unless otherwise provided by law for specific crimes.

Age shall be determined objectively and may not be manipulated to evade accountability or enhance punishment.

c. Presumption of Rehabilitation

Juvenile offenders are presumed capable of rehabilitation, particularly for nonviolent offenses.

Juvenile justice shall prioritize:
	•	education;
	•	treatment;
	•	family involvement;
	•	moral formation;
	•	accountability appropriate to age.

Punishment that permanently forecloses reform is disfavored for youth.

d. Limits of Leniency

Juvenile status does not excuse:
	•	murder;
	•	rape or aggravated sexual assault;
	•	armed robbery;
	•	terrorism;
	•	repeated violent offenses;
	•	predatory conduct demonstrating adult-level intent.

In such cases, courts may impose severe sanctions consistent with public safety and constitutional protections.

e. Transfer to Adult Court

A juvenile may be tried as an adult only upon judicial finding, entered on the record, that:
	•	the offense demonstrates adult-level intent or violence;
	•	the juvenile poses a continuing danger to the public;
	•	juvenile dispositions are inadequate to protect society;
	•	mitigating developmental factors have been fully considered.

Transfer shall never be automatic.

f. Sentencing of Juveniles Tried as Adults

Juveniles convicted in adult court shall receive sentences reflecting:
	•	the seriousness of the offense;
	•	developmental capacity at the time of the offense;
	•	potential for reform;
	•	the need for public protection.

Life imprisonment without review is disfavored and shall be subject to periodic judicial reassessment.

g. Conditions of Confinement

Juveniles shall not be confined with adult offenders except where necessary for safety and security.

Facilities housing juveniles shall emphasize:
	•	education;
	•	discipline;
	•	psychological and psychiatric care;
	•	moral instruction;
	•	preparation for lawful adulthood.

Abuse, neglect, or exploitation of juvenile detainees constitutes a grave offense.

h. Rights of Juvenile Victims

Juvenile victims shall receive enhanced protections consistent with Section 4, including:
	•	trauma-informed procedures;
	•	privacy safeguards;
	•	specialized advocates;
	•	expedited proceedings where appropriate.

The youth of the offender shall not eclipse the youth of the victim.

i. Sealing and Expungement

Records of juvenile offenses shall be sealed upon completion of sentence or disposition, except where:
	•	the offense was violent;
	•	the offense was sexual;
	•	the offender was tried as an adult.

Sealing shall not erase access for courts or law enforcement acting within lawful purposes.

j. Transition to Adulthood

Courts shall ensure that juveniles completing dispositions receive:
	•	educational placement;
	•	vocational training;
	•	mental health support;
	•	supervised reintegration where appropriate.

The goal of juvenile justice is lawful adulthood, not permanent marginalization.

k. Interpretation

This Section shall be interpreted to balance mercy with responsibility, rehabilitation with restraint, and youth with justice.

As Scripture teaches:
“Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.”

Section 15. Tier Two Escalation, Persistent Criminality, and Hard-Labor Remediation

a. Purpose

This Section addresses offenders initially classified under Tier Two who, after genuine access to rehabilitative opportunities, demonstrate persistent criminality, refusal of reform, or contempt for lawful authority. The Republic shall not permit indefinite cycling through failed rehabilitation where public safety and moral order are compromised.

b. Threshold for Escalation

A Tier Two offender becomes eligible for escalation under this Section upon judicial finding, entered on the record, that:
	•	the offender has repeatedly failed structured rehabilitative programs despite reasonable opportunity and support;
	•	the offender has committed new serious offenses, engaged in deception, or materially violated conditions of confinement or release;
	•	the offender demonstrates a settled criminal mindset, evidenced by conduct, statements, or pattern of behavior; and
	•	lesser corrective measures have proven ineffective to protect the public or restore order.

Escalation shall never be automatic and shall require individualized findings.

c. Seven-Year Hard-Labor Escalation

Upon satisfaction of subsection (b), the court may impose an additional fixed term of up to seven (7) years of confinement emphasizing hard labor, beyond the otherwise applicable Tier Two sentence, subject to the following constraints:
	•	labor shall be physically demanding, disciplined, and socially useful, including infrastructure repair, environmental remediation, or other public works;
	•	labor conditions shall remain humane, safe, and medically supervised, consistent with Section 7 stewardship standards;
	•	refusal to labor without medical justification constitutes misconduct and may result in further disciplinary sanctions consistent with law;
	•	this additional term shall not be reduced through administrative credits, routine parole, or earned release mechanisms.

The purpose of this escalation is moral confrontation and character reformation, not vengeance.

d. Opportunity for Redemption

During the escalation term, the offender may earn judicial reconsideration only upon clear and convincing evidence of:
	•	sustained behavioral transformation;
	•	full compliance with labor and restitution obligations;
	•	demonstrated leadership, responsibility, or mentorship within lawful confines; and
	•	credible expert assessment supporting reduced risk of reoffense.

Reconsideration may reduce future restrictions but shall not erase accountability already imposed.

e. Limits and Safeguards

This Section shall not apply to:
	•	offenders whose failure to rehabilitate is primarily attributable to untreated mental incapacity qualifying under Section 9;
	•	offenders whose original placement should have been Tier Three due to misclassification, which shall instead be corrected directly;
	•	nonviolent offenders absent proof of persistent, willful criminality.

f. Relationship to Tier Three

Escalation under this Section does not itself convert a Tier Two offender into Tier Three status. However, conduct justifying escalation may independently support Tier Three review under Sections 6 and 9B where applicable.

g. Interpretation

This Section shall be interpreted to ensure that the Republic does not abandon rehabilitation prematurely, yet does not tolerate endless failure where decisive correction may yet reclaim the offender or protect society.

Hard labor is imposed not to break the body, but to confront the will.
Section 16. Supremacy and Anti-Evasion (Final Interpretation Clause)

No provision of this Article shall be interpreted, construed, applied, or administered in a manner that subordinates:
	•	the protection of the innocent,
	•	the restraint of the dangerous,
	•	the restoration of victims, or
	•	the preservation of moral clarity

to procedural convenience, ideological presumption, fiscal consideration, administrative efficiency, political expediency, institutional self-interest, or abstraction.

Any ambiguity, conflict, or silence within this Article shall be resolved in favor of truth, public safety, victim restoration, proportional accountability, and moral seriousness, consistent with the purposes declared herein.

No authority—judicial, executive, legislative, corporate, or administrative—may evade, dilute, nullify, or undermine the requirements, prohibitions, floors, caps, presumptions, or duties established by this Article through:
	•	creative interpretation;
	•	reclassification, abstraction, or jurisdictional arbitrage;
	•	procedural manipulation or delay;
	•	regulatory substitution for criminal accountability;
	•	privatization of punishment or concealment of enforcement; or
	•	claims of necessity, novelty, or technological inevitability.

Attempts to circumvent the letter or spirit of this Article constitute grave offenses against the Republic, subject to sanction under applicable criminal, civil, and constitutional law.
This Article shall prevail over all inconsistent statutes, regulations, policies, contracts, agreements, technological systems, or administrative practices.

Justice shall not be optional.
Protection shall not be negotiable.
And no power shall stand above the law.



Section 16. Proportional Temporal Sanctions

Where a convicted person possesses a natural or artificial lifespan, regenerative capacity, continuity of consciousness, or temporal endurance substantially exceeding that of ordinary humans, sentencing shall be proportionally adjusted to preserve equivalent deterrence, accountability, and moral weight.

No sentence shall be rendered trivial by extraordinary longevity, nor transformed into perpetual or infinite suffering by immortality or indefinite persistence.

Courts may impose fractional-lifespan sentences, epoch-based sanctions, indeterminate confinement with mandatory periodic review, operational suspension, dormancy, or trusteeship, as necessary to preserve public safety, constitutional order, and proportional justice.

Sentencing shall account for the convicted person’s capacity for delayed action, long-term manipulation, or exploitation of institutional memory.
Incapacitation of non-human persons may include enforced dormancy, computational suspension, instance sequestration, network isolation, trusteeship, or controlled execution of code, subject to proportionality and review.
Section 17. Sentencing of Unitary and Distributed Non-Human Persons

Where a convicted person operates under unitary agency, sanctions shall apply to the person as a whole. All physical embodiments, instances, or operational manifestations may be collectively restrained, confined, transferred, suspended, or placed under trusteeship for the duration of sentence.

Where a convicted person operates under distributed agency, sanctions shall attach only to culpable components, instances, or agents, unless unified intent or coordinated action is proven.

Courts are authorized to attribute responsibility to the highest level of effective control where architectural design is used to evade accountability.

Addendum: Protective Containment, Impairment, and Proportionality
(Doctrinal Clarification — Addendum Only)

Section A. Protective Containment Distinguished from Punishment

The temporary apprehension, restraint, or containment of an individual under the Capacity-Based Intervention Principle shall be deemed protective and preventive in nature, and not criminal punishment, provided that:

a. No adjudication of guilt has occurred, and
b. The restraint is imposed solely to prevent imminent and substantial harm, and
c. All procedural safeguards and time limitations required by the Constitution are observed.

Protective containment shall not, by itself, give rise to criminal liability, enhanced sentencing, or civil disability.


Section B. Impairment and Criminal Responsibility

The presence of intoxication, addiction, psychiatric illness, or neurological impairment shall not excuse criminal conduct once an offense has been committed.

However, such impairment may justify preemptive protective containment prior to the commission of a crime where imminent danger is clearly demonstrated, consistent with constitutional doctrine.

Criminal responsibility shall attach upon the commission of a prohibited act with the requisite mental state as defined by law.

Voluntary or self-induced impairment shall not be considered a mitigating factor in sentencing, and may be considered only for purposes of establishing recklessness, aggravation, or enhanced culpability.

Section C. Sentencing Accountability for Knowing Impairment

Where an individual knowingly places themselves into a state of impairment and, while so impaired, causes serious harm to persons or property, the law may impose sentencing enhancements reflecting the elevated and voluntary risk created by such conduct.

Such enhancements shall be:

a. Proportional to the harm caused,
b. Clearly defined by statute, and
c. Applied without regard to moral judgment or stigma concerning addiction or illness.

Section D. Proportionality for Extended or Non-Human Lifespans

To preserve the moral and deterrent function of punishment across radically unequal lifespans, the law may provide for proportional sentencing multipliers or alternative equivalency measures for:

a. Exceptionally long-lived persons, or
b. Immortal or effectively immortal beings subject to criminal jurisdiction.

Such measures shall ensure that punishment remains meaningful, finite, and non-arbitrary, and shall never authorize eternal or indeterminate punishment.

Section E. Cross-Reference and Controlling Doctrine

This addendum shall be interpreted in full conformity with the Capacity-Based Intervention Principle, which governs pre-criminal containment, evidentiary standards, and procedural safeguards.

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to expand preventive detention beyond the limits imposed by that Principle.

Section F. Locking Clause

This addendum clarifies interpretation only and does not reopen or amend the underlying text of Article VII.
Upon adoption, Article VII shall remain locked and subject to modification only by formal constitutional amendment.
All deprivations of liberty or property as punishment, or as temporary protective measures, shall comply fully with Article II (Sections 0, 5, 5A) and Article 0 definitions. No punishment or restriction may be imposed based solely on diagnosis, status, or speculation absent individualized, evidence-based findings.
