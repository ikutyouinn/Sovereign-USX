Article XXXVI-C — Restoration, Exit, and Reconstitution

Section 1. Mandatory Orientation Toward Restoration

All actions taken pursuant to Articles XXXVI-A and XXXVI-B shall be directed toward the prompt restoration of lawful self-governance.

Stewardship exists solely to cure adjudicated failure and shall not be used to redesign political identity, ideology, or culture.

⸻

Section 2. Restoration Plan and Public Benchmarks

At the commencement of stewardship, a Restoration Plan shall be adopted by the supervising court, specifying:
	1.	objective benchmarks for administrative capacity, fiscal integrity, public safety, and rights compliance;
	2.	timelines for achieving each benchmark;
	3.	conditions for the return or reconstitution of local authority;
	4.	procedures for public reporting and contestation.

Benchmarks shall be measurable, public, and justiciable.

⸻

Section 3. Reconstitution of Local Authority

Upon substantial compliance with restoration benchmarks:
	1.	lawful local authority shall be reinstated or reconstituted;
	2.	interim appointments shall cease;
	3.	elections or ratifications shall occur where required to restore legitimacy.

No individual removed for cause under Article XXXVI-A may reassume authority absent judicial clearance.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall audit and certify the independence, scope, and good-faith conduct of such investigations.


⸻

Section 4. Automatic Exit

Federal stewardship shall terminate automatically upon certification the Constitutional Review Court that restoration benchmarks have been met.

No further legislative, executive, or administrative action is required to effect exit.

Failure to certify shall require written findings specifying remaining deficiencies and a narrow continuation order.

⸻

Section 5. Prohibition on Residual Control

Upon termination:
	1.	all federal control, supervision, and extraordinary authority shall cease;
	2.	all records, assets, and functions shall be returned to local custody;
	3.	no continuing conditions, monitoring regimes, or consent decrees may persist absent fresh judicial findings.

Stewardship shall not convert into oversight by inertia.

⸻

Section 6. Final Accounting and Review

Within a defined period after exit:
	1.	a final public accounting shall be issued;
	2.	an independent audit shall assess compliance, costs, and outcomes;
	3.	affected residents shall retain standing to challenge overreach or unlawful conduct.

Findings shall inform future statutory safeguards.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall conduct or supervise such audits and may refer misconduct to the Constitutional Review Court or prosecutors.

⸻

Section 7. Liability and Redress

Nothing in this Article limits:
	1.	civil or criminal liability for misconduct by stewards or officials;
	2.	remedies for rights violations suffered during stewardship;
	3.	forfeiture of civic citizenship imposed upon conviction under Article XXXVI-A.

Restoration does not erase accountability.

⸻

Section 8. Construction

This Article shall be construed:
	•	to favor the earliest lawful return to self-governance;
	•	against permanence, pretext, or expansion of stewardship;
	•	in harmony with Articles XXVI (Rights Supremacy), XXVIII (Federalism), and XXXVIII (Emergency Powers).
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to investigate stewards, certify abuse, and petition the Constitutional Review Court for removal, sanctions, or termination of stewardship.
The Constitutional Review Court shall have emergency jurisdiction to stay, enjoin, or void any transitional action upon a prima facie showing of unlawful authority, institutional capture, or shadow governance, including upon petition by the CJC.
Exit is the rule; continuation is the exception.
