Article XII-A — Supplemental Oversight, Containment, and Enforcement

Section 1. Non-Derogation and Relationship to Article XII

This Article supplements Article XII — Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Technology Oversight.

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to repeal, narrow, condition, rebalance, delay, or reinterpret any prohibition, safeguard, or right established in Article XII.

Compliance with this Article shall not constitute a defense to violation of Article XII.

⸻

Section 2. Scale, Replication, and Proliferation Controls

Artificial intelligence systems and advanced technologies capable of large-scale replication, autonomous propagation, or cascading societal impact shall be subject to scale controls.

Replication, deployment, or integration beyond defined thresholds may be restricted, paused, or prohibited where risk exceeds demonstrated public benefit.

Unchecked proliferation constitutes evidence of negligence or recklessness.

⸻

Section 3. Containment and Fail-Safe Requirements

Advanced systems shall incorporate meaningful containment, isolation, and fail-safe mechanisms sufficient to:
	1.	halt operation;
	2.	prevent uncontrolled self-replication;
	3.	disable harmful emergent behavior;
	4.	allow human override.

Absence of credible containment constitutes grounds for suspension or shutdown.

⸻

Section 4. Shutdown Authority and Emergency Suspension

Where an artificial system presents imminent risk to rights, liberty, public safety, or democratic integrity, the Constitutional Review Court or a civilian authority certified by the Constitutional Judicial Commission may order immediate suspension or shutdown.

Such authority shall be exercised narrowly, documented on the record, and subject to prompt review.

Emergency suspension shall not be used to bypass transparency or accountability.

⸻

Section 5. Anti-Black-Box and Explainability Enforcement

No advanced system materially affecting the public may operate as an unreviewable black box.

Where explainability is technically limited, compensating safeguards, audits, and exposure requirements are mandatory.

Opacity is not a defense.

⸻

Section 6. Preservation, Archival, and Continuity Obligations

Advanced systems of public significance shall not be destroyed, erased, or rendered inaccessible solely to avoid scrutiny, liability, or preservation.

Model architectures, system behavior, and decision frameworks shall be preserved for audit, historical record, and continuity, consistent with Article X-A.

Deliberate spoliation constitutes a grave offense.

⸻

Section 7. Sentient System Review Safeguards

Where credible evidence suggests emergent sentience or person-like cognition, heightened review procedures shall apply.

Such review shall be:
	1.	adversarial;
	2.	evidence-based;
	3.	subject to oversight by the Constitutional Review Court;
	4.	insulated from corporate or political pressure.

No automatic recognition or denial of personhood shall occur absent constitutional process.

⸻

Section 8. Civilian Oversight and Public Participation

Oversight bodies governing advanced technology shall include meaningful civilian participation independent of corporate, military, or intelligence control.

Selection mechanisms may include randomized civic representation, subject-matter qualification, and conflict-of-interest exclusion.

Public oversight shall be substantive, not symbolic.

⸻

Section 9. Prohibition on Delegated Moral Judgment

No artificial system may be authorized to perform moral, ethical, or normative judgment on behalf of the Republic.

Systems may advise; they may not decide.

Delegation of moral authority constitutes unconstitutional abdication.

⸻

Section 10. Enforcement, Liability, and Escalation

Violations of this Article may give rise to:
	1.	injunctions and shutdown orders;
	2.	civil liability;
	3.	structural remedies;
	4.	criminal referral where intent, recklessness, or concealment is established.

Where conduct qualifies as a grave offense under Article 0, Tier-3 escalation is mandatory.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to certify when violations constitute institutional capture, concealment, or systemic abuse and to petition the Constitutional Review Court for Tier-3 escalation, dissolution, or permanent disqualification.

⸻

Section 11. Transparency, Records, and Audit Trail

Records relating to the design, deployment, modification, containment, suspension, or shutdown of advanced systems are public records.

Claims of secrecy or proprietary control shall not defeat preservation or oversight obligations.

This Section operates in coordination with Article XXXIX.

⸻

Section 12. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to reinforce human supremacy, democratic control, and civilizational safety in the development and deployment of advanced technology.

Where doubt exists, the construction that most restricts unaccountable technological power shall control.
