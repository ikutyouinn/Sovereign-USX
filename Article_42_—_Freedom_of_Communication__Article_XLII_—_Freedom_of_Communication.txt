Article XLII — Freedom of Communication

Charge
The modern censorship regime is tyranny in digital form: surveillance that chills speech, compelled platform control that launders censorship through intermediaries, and pretextual regulation—invoking safety, democracy, or stability—to govern discourse rather than conduct.

When the State claims authority over truth, liberty collapses. Mass surveillance breeds self-censorship; compelled moderation converts private platforms into instruments of control; and “misinformation” becomes a weapon to silence dissent instead of confront error.

Free societies depend on the ability of individuals to speak, listen, assemble, and associate without permission. Encrypted and anonymous communication is not a threat to self-government; it is a prerequisite for it.

This Republic rejects prior restraint, compelled mediation, mass surveillance, and encryption sabotage. Criminal acts may be punished, but communication itself shall not be pre-emptively governed, filtered, or coerced. Let the People speak, listen, organize, and decide—freely and without fear.

Section 1. Broad Protection of Communication

No law shall abridge the freedom of speech, expression, press, assembly, petition, or any form of communication, including electronic, encrypted, anonymous, or broadcast forms, whether public or private.

These protections apply regardless of medium, technology, platform, or method of transmission, present or future.

Section 2. No Prior Restraint; No Compelled Mediation

Prior restraint on communication is prohibited.

No person, platform, network, or intermediary shall be compelled to censor, moderate, amplify, demote, label, or otherwise mediate content absent a specific judicial order addressing proven, particularized harm attributable to identified actors.

General mandates, algorithmic filtering, or blanket content controls are forbidden.

Section 3. Encryption, Anonymity, and Private Association

The right to private, encrypted communication and anonymous expression is inviolable.

No law shall require encryption backdoors, key escrow, mandatory identification to speak, real-name requirements, or systemic weakening of privacy or security for the general public.

The State shall not condition access to communication networks on identity disclosure or viewpoint compliance.

Section 4. Surveillance Limits

Mass, bulk, or warrantless surveillance of communications is prohibited.

Targeted surveillance may occur only pursuant to a judicial warrant based on probable cause of a specific crime, describing with particularity the person, scope, and duration. Surveillance based on thought, belief, association, or lawful expression is forbidden.

Section 5. Platform Neutrality and State Action

Private platforms may set their own terms and exercise editorial discretion.

However, when a platform functions as a common carrier, receives material government compulsion or direction, or acts in concert with the State, it shall not discriminate or impose restrictions based on viewpoint, lawful political content, or identity.

The State may not evade this Article by outsourcing censorship, moderation, or surveillance to private actors.

The State shall not grant, condition, revoke, or threaten immunity, liability protection, regulatory forbearance, funding, or preferential treatment based on a platform’s willingness to censor, surveil, or moderate lawful communication on behalf of the State.

Section 6. Narrow Carveouts for Criminal Harm (Strictly Limited)

Nothing in this Article prevents post-facto enforcement against criminal acts committed through communication, provided that all safeguards below are met:

(a) Imminent, Specific Harm

Intervention is permitted only to address direct incitement, true threats, or coordination of imminent lawless action toward identifiable victims, supported by clear and convincing evidence, and subject to judicial order or immediate judicial review.

(b) Crimes Against Children

Material constituting evidence of child exploitation may be investigated and prosecuted as criminal conduct, not as protected expression, without mandating general-purpose scanning, platform-wide monitoring, or the weakening of encryption, anonymity, or security for the general public. Enforcement shall proceed only through targeted warrants, individualized investigations, and judicially supervised process.

(c) Fraud, Coercion, and Criminal Conspiracy

Speech integral to fraud, extortion, trafficking, or criminal conspiracy may be prosecuted after the fact based on acts and intent, without prior restraint or generalized monitoring.

Section 7. Prohibited Pretexts

The following shall never justify restraint, surveillance, or compelled mediation of communication:
	•	Claims of “misinformation” or “disinformation” absent specific criminal acts;
	•	“Hate” or offensive expression absent direct, imminent threats;
	•	Public order, democratic stability, foreign influence, or ideological harm;
	•	Health, safety, or national security narratives lacking individualized warrants and evidence.
Section 7B. Prohibition on Speech-Crimes of Mere Dissent

(a) Core Rule.
No law shall criminalize, penalize, or create civil disability for speech or expressive conduct solely because it:
    1. criticizes, condemns, mocks, or satirizes the Republic, a State, any public institution, any public officer, any political party, or any public policy;
    2. disputes official narratives, official statistics, official communications, or claims of governmental legitimacy, competence, or morality; or
    3. expresses opposition to war, military action, foreign policy, policing, taxation, regulation, or any other exercise of public power.

(b) Forbidden Labels and Vagueness.
No person shall be prosecuted or punished under vague, elastic, or status-based speech categories, including “discrediting,” “fake news,” “harmful misinformation,” “anti-state propaganda,” “extremism,” “radicalization,” “hate,” or similar labels, unless the State proves each element of a defined criminal offense with particularity under subsection (c).

(c) Narrow Exception for Direct Criminal Instrumentality.
Speech may be restricted or punished only where the government proves, by clear and convincing evidence:
    1. specific intent (mens rea) to cause or materially facilitate a defined criminal act;
    2. a direct and proximate causal connection between the expression and that criminal act; and
    3. imminence and likelihood of the criminal act, not speculative or generalized risk.
Mere falsity, error, controversial opinion, moral offense, institutional embarrassment, or political inconvenience shall never suffice.

(d) Prior Restraint and Orders.
No injunction, censorship order, compelled deletion, compelled labeling, or compelled mediation may issue against lawful political communication. Any order targeting specific expression shall be narrowly tailored to prevent a proven, particularized criminal act, and shall state written findings on intent, imminence, and causation.

(e) Construction.
Ambiguities in speech-restricting laws shall be construed against the State. The burden rests on the State to prove the narrow exception; the presumption favors free expression.
This subsection does not bar prosecution of underlying crimes; it bars punishment based on label absent proof of defined criminal elements.

Section 7C. Prohibition on “Foreign Agent” and “Undesirable” Stigma Regimes

(a) Core Rule.
No person, association, publisher, platform, charity, newsroom, academic institution, or civic organization shall be designated, labeled, registered, or burdened as a “foreign agent,” “foreign-influenced,” “undesirable,” “enemy of the people,” or similar stigmatizing status by reason of foreign contact, foreign funding, cross-border affiliation, international speech, or political viewpoint.

(b) Due Process Threshold.
The State may impose narrowly tailored disclosure or registration duties only upon conviction (after trial and appeal) for a specific crime involving:
    1. espionage; or
    2. knowing direction or operational control by a foreign state in the commission of defined criminal acts.
Financial support, donations, grants, or association alone shall not satisfy this threshold absent proof of knowing criminal coordination.

(c) No Compelled Disclaimers; No Forced Self-Denunciation.
The State shall not compel any person or entity to append government-scripted labels, disclaimers, warnings, or “agent” markings to lawful speech, publications, websites, broadcasts, or communications. The State shall not require routine public self-identification that predictably chills lawful political participation.

(d) No Administrative Suppression by Designation.
No designation, listing, or administrative finding may be used to deny banking, payment rails, hosting, domain services, employment, licensing, education access, permits, or access to public venues for lawful speech and association, absent conviction for a defined crime and individualized judicial findings of necessity.

(e) Remedies and Oversight.
Any person subject to attempted designation or compelled labeling under this Section shall have immediate standing for expedited injunctive relief. Courts shall presume irreparable harm from compelled stigma or chilled political speech.

Section 8. Remedies and Standing

Any person or entity with standing may seek judicial relief for violations of this Article. Courts shall provide expedited review and effective remedies, including injunctive relief and suppression of unlawfully obtained evidence.

Section 9. Construction

This Article shall be interpreted to favor maximum freedom of communication, least-restrictive means, and individualized, judicially supervised enforcement. It shall be read in harmony with Article XXVI (Charter of Inviolable Rights) and shall not be suspended by emergency declaration, administrative necessity, or indirect coercion.

Section 10. Lock-Protected Provisions

Pursuant to Article XV (Amendment and Lock Clauses), the following provisions of Article XLII — Freedom of Communication are designated Lock-Protected Provisions.
