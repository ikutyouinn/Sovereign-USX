Article XLII — Freedom of Communication

Charge

The modern censorship regime is tyranny in digital form—a sprawling apparatus of surveillance, compelled platform moderation, encryption sabotage, and pretextual control that chills expression before it is even spoken. Governments increasingly seek to govern not conduct, but discourse itself, laundering censorship through private intermediaries while invoking safety, democracy, or stability as justification.

History teaches that when the State claims authority over truth, liberty collapses. Mass surveillance breeds self-censorship; compelled moderation converts private platforms into instruments of control; and “misinformation” becomes a weapon to silence dissent rather than confront error. The result is not safety, but conformity—enforced not by law alone, but by fear.

Free societies have always depended on the ability of individuals to speak, listen, assemble, and associate without permission. Encrypted and anonymous communication is not a threat to democracy; it is a prerequisite for it. When citizens must identify themselves to speak, or fear surveillance to communicate, self-government becomes impossible.

This Republic rejects the censorship state in all its forms. It rejects prior restraint, compelled mediation, mass surveillance, and backdoor control disguised as regulation. It affirms that criminal acts may be punished—but that communication itself shall not be pre-emptively governed, filtered, or coerced.

We choose an abundance of ideas over an enforced scarcity of truth. Let the People speak, listen, organize, and decide—freely, openly, and without fear. A Republic that cannot communicate freely cannot remain free at all.

Section 1. Broad Protection of Communication

No law shall abridge the freedom of speech, expression, press, assembly, petition, or any form of communication, including electronic, encrypted, anonymous, or broadcast forms, whether public or private.

These protections apply regardless of medium, technology, platform, or method of transmission, present or future.

Section 2. No Prior Restraint; No Compelled Mediation

Prior restraint on communication is prohibited.

No person, platform, network, or intermediary shall be compelled to censor, moderate, amplify, demote, label, or otherwise mediate content absent a specific judicial order addressing proven, particularized harm attributable to identified actors.

General mandates, algorithmic filtering, or blanket content controls are forbidden.

Section 3. Encryption, Anonymity, and Private Association

The right to private, encrypted communication and anonymous expression is inviolable.

No law shall require encryption backdoors, key escrow, mandatory identification to speak, real-name requirements, or systemic weakening of privacy or security for the general public.

The State shall not condition access to communication networks on identity disclosure or viewpoint compliance.

Section 4. Surveillance Limits

Mass, bulk, or warrantless surveillance of communications is prohibited.

Targeted surveillance may occur only pursuant to a judicial warrant based on probable cause of a specific crime, describing with particularity the person, scope, and duration. Surveillance based on thought, belief, association, or lawful expression is forbidden.

Section 5. Platform Neutrality and State Action

Private platforms may set their own terms and exercise editorial discretion.

However, when a platform functions as a common carrier, receives material government compulsion or direction, or acts in concert with the State, it shall not discriminate or impose restrictions based on viewpoint, lawful political content, or identity.

The State may not evade this Article by outsourcing censorship, moderation, or surveillance to private actors.

The State shall not grant, condition, revoke, or threaten immunity, liability protection, regulatory forbearance, funding, or preferential treatment based on a platform’s willingness to censor, surveil, or moderate lawful communication on behalf of the State.

Section 6. Narrow Carveouts for Criminal Harm (Strictly Limited)

Nothing in this Article prevents post-facto enforcement against criminal acts committed through communication, provided that all safeguards below are met:

(a) Imminent, Specific Harm

Intervention is permitted only to address direct incitement, true threats, or coordination of imminent lawless action toward identifiable victims, supported by clear and convincing evidence, and subject to judicial order or immediate judicial review.

(b) Crimes Against Children

Material constituting evidence of child exploitation may be investigated and prosecuted as criminal conduct, not as protected expression, without mandating general-purpose scanning, platform-wide monitoring, or the weakening of encryption, anonymity, or security for the general public. Enforcement shall proceed only through targeted warrants, individualized investigations, and judicially supervised process.

(c) Fraud, Coercion, and Criminal Conspiracy

Speech integral to fraud, extortion, trafficking, or criminal conspiracy may be prosecuted after the fact based on acts and intent, without prior restraint or generalized monitoring.

Section 7. Prohibited Pretexts

The following shall never justify restraint, surveillance, or compelled mediation of communication:
	•	Claims of “misinformation” or “disinformation” absent specific criminal acts;
	•	“Hate” or offensive expression absent direct, imminent threats;
	•	Public order, democratic stability, foreign influence, or ideological harm;
	•	Health, safety, or national security narratives lacking individualized warrants and evidence.

Section 8. Remedies and Standing

Any person or entity with standing may seek judicial relief for violations of this Article. Courts shall provide expedited review and effective remedies, including injunctive relief and suppression of unlawfully obtained evidence.

Section 9. Construction

This Article shall be interpreted to favor maximum freedom of communication, least-restrictive means, and individualized, judicially supervised enforcement. It shall be read in harmony with Article XXVI (Charter of Inviolable Rights) and shall not be suspended by emergency declaration, administrative necessity, or indirect coercion.
