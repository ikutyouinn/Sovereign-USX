Article XV-A — Emergency Powers Harmonization

Section 1. Non-Derogation and Relationship to Article XV

This Article supplements Article XV.

No declaration of emergency, necessity, crisis, or exigency shall suspend, override, condition, delay, or evade any provision of this Constitution unless such suspension is expressly authorized by this Constitution and explicitly names the affected Article and Section.

No emergency authority exercised under this Article shall suspend, override, delay, or condition the operation of Article XXVIII-A — State Nullification and Federalism Safeguards.

Where doubt exists, the construction that most preserves rights and limits power shall control.

⸻

Section 2. Single-Emergency Rule

At any given time, all asserted emergency powers exercised by the Republic shall be treated as part of a single constitutional emergency, regardless of label, agency, or domain.

No authority may segment, stack, or relabel emergencies to evade constitutional limits.

⸻

Section 3. Duration  Harmonization

All emergency authorities expire after ninety (90) days unless renewed pursuant to this Article, and no emergency authority may be renewed more than once absent materially new facts.

Where multiple emergency authorities prescribe different durations, the shortest duration shall control.

Extensions may occur only through the strictest renewal process applicable among the invoked authorities.

Rolling or serial emergencies are prohibited.

⸻

Section 4. Scope Harmonization

Where multiple emergency provisions authorize differing scopes of action, the narrowest scope shall control.

Emergency authority shall be limited to actions strictly necessary to address the precipitating condition.

Generalized, anticipatory, or speculative measures are prohibited.

⸻

Section 5. Rights-Preserving Tie-Breaker

Where emergency authorities conflict, the interpretation that most preserves individual rights, due process, and civilian supremacy shall prevail.

No emergency interpretation may diminish non-derogable rights or locked provisions.

⸻

Section 6. Cross-Article Emergency Claims

No authority may invoke emergency language from one Article to bypass constraints imposed by another.

Emergency provisions shall be read in coordination, not isolation.

⸻

Section 7. Judicial Acceleration

All emergency actions shall be subject to accelerated judicial review.

Courts shall not defer to emergency declarations and shall independently assess necessity, scope, and duration.

Delay shall not be justified by crisis.

⸻

Section 8. Automatic Reversion and Cleanup

Upon expiration or termination of an emergency:
	1.	all extraordinary powers immediately cease;
	2.	all emergency rules automatically sunset;
	3.	all records are preserved as public records;
	4.	all actions taken are subject to retrospective review.

Failure to revert constitutes a continuing constitutional violation.

⸻

Section 9. Anti-Precedent Rule

No emergency action, interpretation, or practice may be cited as precedent for future authority.

Emergency governance is inherently non-precedential.

⸻

Section 10. Enforcement and Severity

Willful violation of this Article by public officials or institutions constitutes abuse of constitutional authority.

Where such violation involves concealment, persistence beyond authorization, or systemic harm, it qualifies as a grave offense under Article 0 and is subject to Tier-3 escalation.

⸻

Section 11. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to ensure that emergencies do not become mechanisms of constitutional erosion.

Where doubt exists, the construction that most rapidly restores normal constitutional order shall control.
