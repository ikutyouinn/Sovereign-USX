Section 5. Anti-Scrip and Employer Currency Prohibition

Section 9. Enforcement and Severity

Willful violation of this Article by public officials or institutions constitutes fiscal abuse of the public trust.

Where such conduct involves concealment, systemic coercion, or large-scale harm, it shall qualify as a grave offense under Article 0 and be subject to Tier-3 escalation.

Section 10. Transparency and Records

All tax structures, compensation rules, enforcement mechanisms, and exemptions shall be publicly disclosed and preserved as public records.
