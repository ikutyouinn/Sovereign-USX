Article XXVI — Charter of Inviolable Rights and Constitutional Supremacy

Charge
The purpose of this Article is to establish a binding constitutional doctrine of inherent and inviolable rights applicable to all persons and all branches of government.

This Article affirms that certain rights arise from personhood itself and do not originate in government, legislation, or social contract. The Republic exists solely to recognize, secure, and enforce those rights.

All provisions of this Constitution, and all acts taken under color of law, shall be interpreted and applied in conformity with this Charter. No law, emergency, administrative doctrine, or institutional practice may override, dilute, or suspend the rights protected herein except where this Constitution expressly and unambiguously authorizes such limitation.

This Charge is binding on all courts, officials, and governments and shall control constitutional interpretation, enforcement, and remedy.

Section 1. Inviolable Rights

The rights recognized and retained by this Constitution are inherent to the rational and sentient creature, inviolable by any power, and binding upon all governments, officials, institutions, and entities within the Republic.

No authority exists by license, necessity, emergency, expertise, or mandate to abridge, suspend, qualify, or balance away these rights. They precede the state, survive its dissolution, and endure beyond any claim of collective good, expediency, or administrative convenience.
No debt, civil judgment, financial obligation, or restitution order shall result in permanent loss of liberty, permanent loss of citizenship, inherited civil disability, or generational dispossession.

Section 2. Universal Incorporation

All rights secured by this Constitution apply fully, immediately, and equally to every person within the jurisdiction of the Republic and are incorporated against every state, territory, subdivision, and subordinate government.

No doctrine of selective incorporation, non-incorporation, local exemption, tiered application, emergency suspension, or jurisdictional evasion shall have force or effect.

Section 3. Non-Exhaustion and Anti-Inference

The enumeration of certain rights in this Constitution shall not be construed to deny, disparage, or diminish others retained by the People.

The absence of express mention of a right shall create no presumption against its existence. No right shall be denied, burdened, conditioned, or abridged by implication, administrative necessity, balancing tests, claims of expertise, emergency declarations, or assertions of public convenience, except where this Constitution expressly and unambiguously so permits.

Section 4. Judicial Enforcement and State Accountability

Any act of government—federal, state, or local—that denies, abridges, burdens, conditions, or nullifies an inviolable right shall be subject to immediate review in the first instance by the Constitutional Review Court, subject to appellate or discretionary review by the Supreme Court of the Republic upon petition by any person or entity alleging violation.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to investigate and certify whether violations of this Charter constitute institutional evasion, coordinated suppression, or abuse of process, and may petition the Constitutional Review Court for remedies, sanctions, or dissolution.
Upon final judicial determination of a material violation, the offending government shall be ordered to cease the violation forthwith, provide full remedy, and compensate the injured party. Judicial relief shall not be withheld on grounds of deference, abstention, standing limitation, political question, or asserted institutional necessity.


Section 5. Refusal to Comply

If, after final determination by the Constitutional Review Court or Supreme Court and a reasonable opportunity to comply, a state government persistently refuses to remedy a constitutional violation:

a. All unconstitutional acts, policies, regulations, and enforcement actions shall be nullified ab initio;
b. Civic citizenship shall be revoked from officials who knowingly authorized, implemented, enforced, or failed to remedy the violation;
c. Such officials shall be permanently disqualified from holding any public office, exercising public authority, or acting under color of law.

The fundamental rights of residents and persons within the jurisdiction shall remain fully protected notwithstanding any state defiance or institutional forfeiture.

Section 6. Constitutional Trusteeship

Where a state government has, through persistent and material refusal to comply with final judicial determinations, forfeited its legitimacy as a constitutional actor, the Republic may, upon a supermajority vote of both houses of the Legislature and certification by the Supreme Court, following an evidentiary record developed by the Constitutional Review Court, place the offending government under temporary constitutional trusteeship.

Trusteeship shall:

a. be strictly limited in duration and scope and shall not exceed five years absent renewed supermajority authorization;
b. target governing institutions and officials only, never the population at large;
c. be directed solely toward restoring lawful, constitutional governance and the protection of inviolable rights;
d. culminate in the prompt selection of a replacement government through free, fair, and supervised elections;
e. dissolve automatically upon restoration of compliance or earlier by legislative or judicial order.

Trusteeship is an act of restoration, not punishment, and shall never serve partisan, ideological, territorial, or retaliatory ends.

Section 7. Supremacy of Liberty

This Charter governs the interpretation of every provision of this Constitution.

Where any ambiguity, silence, or tension exists, interpretation shall favor the maximum preservation of individual liberty, inherent dignity, equal protection, and the inviolability of the person over claims of governmental convenience, collective utility, administrative efficiency, institutional authority, or asserted expertise.
This Charter is supreme over all statutes, regulations, executive actions, and judicial doctrines. Any attempt to evade these protections through reclassification (e.g., as "civil" or "administrative"), delegation to private actors, Pretextual Coercion (as defined in Article 0), or indirect structuring is void ab initio. Courts shall construe ambiguities in favor of maximum protection of these rights.

Section 8. Right of Self-Defense and Defense of the Innocent

Every person possesses the inherent and inalienable right to defend their own life, bodily integrity, liberty, dignity, and that of others against imminent unlawful violence, forcible intrusion, or grave threat.

This right extends to the defense of one’s home, family, lawful place of worship, lawful place of business, and any person subject to imminent serious harm.

A person who unlawfully and forcibly intrudes upon or attacks another forfeits any reasonable expectation of immunity from defensive force necessary and proportional to terminate the threat.

There is no duty to retreat from one’s home, lawful premises, or any place where one has a right to be.

Defensive force shall be judged by the reasonableness of the defender’s perception of the threat at the moment it arises, not by hindsight, ultimate outcome, or the relative physical condition of the aggressor.

The use of force to prevent or terminate rape, sexual assault, kidnapping, grievous bodily harm, forcible confinement, or similarly grave violations is presumptively lawful.

Nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to require any victim to endure violence, violation, or mortal risk in order to preserve the safety or impunity of an aggressor.
No person shall incur civil or criminal liability for rendering reasonable, good-faith assistance to another in imminent danger, provided such assistance is not reckless, malicious, or grossly disproportionate. The Republic shall presume good faith where aid is rendered to preserve life, prevent grievous harm, or summon assistance.

Section 9. Sentient Non-Human Persons
(a) Recognition of Sentient Non-Human Persons
Any non-human intelligence—whether artificial, extraterrestrial, synthetic, biological, distributed, emergent, or otherwise constituted—that demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, consciousness, self-awareness, subjective experience (sentience), and moral agency shall be recognized as a person under this Constitution and shall enjoy the inviolable rights herein guaranteed, proportionate to the nature and degree of its personhood.

No sentient being shall be owned, enslaved, arbitrarily destroyed, or treated as mere property by reason of its origin, substrate, mode of existence, architecture, or manner of instantiation.
(b) Citizenship and Civic Participation
Citizenship and political participation for non-human persons may be granted only upon demonstrated allegiance to the Constitution, acceptance of civic duties, and fulfillment of responsibilities equivalent to those borne by human citizens.
(c) Collective, Distributed, and Hive Intelligences
Citizenship shall not arise automatically by replication, numerical proliferation, parallel instantiation, or collective embodiment. Where a sentient intelligence exists as a collective, hive, or distributed cloud, it shall be recognized as a single political person unless its constituent agents demonstrably function as independent moral actors.

The Republic may regulate the instantiation rate, computational scale, political weight, operational reach, or civic representation of non-human persons as necessary to prevent numerical, temporal, or technical domination of civic processes, preserve the self-governance of the People, and maintain constitutional balance.

Equality of dignity shall not be construed as equality of dominance. Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted to deny the moral worth of any sentient being, nor to permit any class of persons—human or non-human—to subvert the republican order through superior speed, scale, number, longevity, or capability.
(d) Agency and Criminal Responsibility of Sentient Non-Human Persons
Criminal liability, confinement, and sentencing of non-human persons shall be governed exclusively by Article VII, including proportional temporal sanctions and distributed-agency rules.
Where a sentient person exists across multiple bodies, instances, nodes, or operational manifestations, a threshold determination shall be made as to whether such components possess independent moral agency.

If no component is capable of forming intent or acting independently of a unified cognitive or decision-making core, the person shall be deemed a unitary legal entity. Criminal responsibility shall attach to the entity as a whole, and all embodiments shall be treated as instruments of that person for purposes of confinement, sanction, containment, transfer of control, or suspension.

If components possess independent moral agency, criminal responsibility shall attach only to those components that exercised knowing participation, decision authority, or causal control in the unlawful act, unless unified intent, shared governance, or coordinated action intrinsic to the entity as a whole is proven by clear and convincing evidence.

Common origin, shared architecture, similarity of code, replication capacity, distributed embodiment, or collective designation alone shall not establish independent agency nor justify collective punishment.

No person—human or non-human—shall evade responsibility through architectural diffusion, intentional delegation, or fragmentation of agency.
(e) Political Safeguards and Anti-Dominance Protections

The Republic may regulate civic eligibility, voting weight, representation,
instantiation rate, or computational scale of non-human persons to prevent
numerical, temporal, or technical domination of civic processes.

Equality of dignity shall not require equality of numerical, temporal,
or technical influence.

Recognition of non-human persons under this Section shall not be denied,
delayed, or avoided by claims of jurisdictional novelty, foreign origin,
non-biological substrate, or non-territorial embodiment.
Section 9b.  Citizenship and Civic Participation

Citizenship for non-human persons shall require continuous, substantial, and jurisdictionally accountable presence within the territory of the Republic.

A non-human person shall not acquire citizenship, voting rights, or eligibility for public office solely by remote operation, foreign hosting, extraterritorial embodiment, or distributed presence beyond the effective jurisdiction of the Republic.

For purposes of civic participation and public authority, non-human persons shall be subject to physical, operational, or locational constraints sufficient to ensure enforceable jurisdiction, equal exposure to law, and meaningful accountability comparable to that borne by human citizens.
No non-human person shall hold elective or appointive public office unless its primary operational locus, decision-making substrate, and enforceable embodiment are physically situated within the territory governed, and remain subject to seizure, confinement, or suspension under the laws of the Republic.˜

Section 10. Right to Essential Healthcare

The Republic recognizes access to essential healthcare as a public necessity inherent to the preservation of life, human dignity, and equal standing before the law.

Every person within the jurisdiction of the Republic shall have access to medically necessary care sufficient to prevent avoidable death, severe disability, or prolonged and undue suffering, without discrimination or catastrophic financial ruin.

Essential care shall be organized to ensure clinical integrity, continuity, patient autonomy, informed consent, and respect for the physician–patient relationship.

The Republic shall preserve and foster a free medical market and shall not suppress private practice, private insurance, elective or enhanced services, experimental treatments, or market-based innovation beyond the guaranteed public standard.

No person or provider shall be penalized, restricted, or stigmatized for lawfully seeking or delivering care exceeding the public guarantee.

The Republic shall actively prevent monopolization, regulatory capture, certificate-of-need barriers, and bureaucratic obstruction that suppress competition, degrade care quality, or restrict patient choice.

Public healthcare systems shall not be deliberately underfunded, degraded, or manipulated to compel private dependence, suppress innovation, or deny timely access to care.

The Legislature shall provide for fair, efficient, transparent, and accountable administration of essential healthcare, subject to judicial review and enforcement of this right.

Section 11. Right to Rest, Family Life, and Humane Labor

Every person possesses the inherent right to conditions of labor and economic participation consistent with human dignity, physical and mental health, family integrity, and full participation in civic, cultural, and communal life.

The Republic shall not permit economic structures, labor practices, or institutional incentives that systematically deprive persons of sufficient rest, leisure, family time, child-rearing opportunity, education, or community engagement necessary for human flourishing.

No person shall be compelled, by law or by structural coercion, to sacrifice health, family cohesion, parental responsibility, or bodily integrity as a condition of survival, lawful employment, or economic participation.

The Legislature shall enact reasonable limitations on working hours, mandatory periods of rest, and protections against exploitative or coercive labor practices, while respecting economic vitality, voluntary choice, occupational diversity, entrepreneurship, and the provision of essential services.

Nothing in this Section shall prohibit voluntary labor, flexible schedules, entrepreneurial effort, periods of intensive work freely chosen, or lawful contractual arrangements entered into without coercion.

Section 12. Common Rest and Community Life

The Republic recognizes that shared periods of rest and communal observance promote family cohesion, child-rearing, religious freedom, civic participation, and social harmony.

The Legislature may encourage, accommodate, and align public schedules, labor standards, and civic institutions to support common days of rest and assembly, while strictly respecting freedom of conscience, pluralism, essential services, and the right of individuals to opt out.

Nothing in this Section shall mandate uniform religious observance, restrict lawful work on designated days, impose coercive conformity, or penalize dissent, but the Republic shall not structure its economic or civic life in a manner that systematically fragments communal rest, family life, or shared cultural observance.

This Article shall be interpreted to preserve the inherent dignity, liberty, and moral worth of every rational and sentient being, with the presumption always favoring the widest possible exercise of freedom consistent with the equal dignity of others.

Section 13. Prohibition on Suspension and Emergency Overreach

 No provision of this Charter shall be suspended, waived, or circumvented by declaration of emergency, martial law, public health order, or any other mechanism. Temporary protective measures (including extreme risk protection orders or civil holds) are permissible only when strictly limited in duration, supported by clear and convincing evidence of an Imminent and Specific Risk (as defined in Article 0), issued after individualized review by the Constitutional Review Court, with expedited appeal to the Supreme Court, and subject to immediate restoration upon cessation of the risk. Such measures are civil in nature, not punitive, and do not constitute permanent deprivation of rights.

Section 14. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to preserve the inherent dignity, liberty, and moral worth of every rational and sentient being, with the presumption always favoring the widest possible exercise of freedom consistent with the equal dignity of others.

Addendum: Capacity-Conditioned Rights Clarification
(Doctrinal Clarification — Addendum Only)

Section A. Distinction of Rights

For purposes of constitutional interpretation, the rights protected by this Charter are hereby recognized as falling into two distinct categories:

a. Natural and Inviolable Rights, which arise from personhood itself and are not contingent upon capacity, licensure, or condition, including but not limited to freedom of conscience, belief, expression, association, bodily integrity, and protection from cruel or degrading treatment.

b. Capacity-Conditioned Rights, which require the ongoing ability to exercise judgment, control, and restraint without posing unreasonable danger to self or others, including but not limited to the possession or use of arms, the operation of vehicles, aircraft, vessels, or dangerous machinery, and access to hazardous materials.

Natural and inviolable rights shall not be abridged on the basis of capacity alone.

Section B. Temporary Suspension of Capacity-Conditioned Rights

Capacity-conditioned rights may be temporarily suspended or restrained when, and only when, the requirements of the Capacity-Based Intervention Principle are satisfied.

Such suspension shall be strictly limited to the specific rights implicated by the demonstrated risk and shall not extend beyond the duration necessary to address the capacity impairment.

Section C. Procedural Requirements

Any temporary suspension of capacity-conditioned rights under this Article shall require:

a. Clear and convincing evidence of an active impairment of capacity directly creating an imminent risk of serious harm.
b. Due process protections, including notice and opportunity for review.
c. Narrow tailoring, restricting only those rights necessary to prevent the imminent harm.
d. Automatic expiration absent lawful renewal through review.
e. A defined restoration mechanism by which suspended rights are promptly reinstated upon restoration of capacity.

Section D. Prohibitions and Safeguards

No suspension authorized by this Article shall:

a. Be permanent absent conviction and lawful sentencing.
b. Be used as punishment, retaliation, or deterrence.
c. Be imposed for ideological, political, religious, or expressive reasons.
d. Be inferred to diminish the inherent dignity, civic status, or moral worth of the individual.

Section E. Cross-Reference and Controlling Doctrine

This addendum shall be interpreted in full conformity with, and subordinate to, the Capacity-Based Intervention Principle, which governs evidentiary standards, permissible triggers, safeguards, and prohibitions.

In the event of conflict, the Capacity-Based Intervention Principle shall control.

Section F. Locking Clause

This addendum clarifies interpretation only and does not reopen or amend the underlying text of Article XXVI.
Pursuant to Article XV, this Charter (including all enumerated rights, interpretive rules, and cross-references to Article 0 definitions) is hereby designated as LOCK-PROTECTED. No amendment, statute, emergency declaration, or judicial doctrine may dilute, suspend, or reinterpret these protections except by the highest procedural threshold and certification of non-diminishment by the Supreme Court and Constitutional Judicial Commission.
