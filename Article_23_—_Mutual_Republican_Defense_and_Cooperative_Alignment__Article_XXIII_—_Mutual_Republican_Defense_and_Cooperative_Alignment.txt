Article XXIII — Mutual Republican Defense and Cooperative Alignment

Charge

This Article establishes constitutional principles governing collective defense, international cooperation, and alignment with foreign states by the Republic. All cooperative defense and foreign alignment shall be undertaken solely for the protection of the People, the preservation of constitutional self-government, and the defense of lawful sovereignty, and shall be exercised transparently and pursuant to constitutional authorization. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to authorize imperial control, covert intervention, proxy warfare, or binding foreign entanglements inconsistent with democratic accountability and constitutional limits.


Section 1. Principles of External Alignment

a. Non-Imperial Doctrine
The Republic shall not pursue empire, territorial expansion, vassalage, or indirect domination of foreign peoples.

No foreign policy objective shall justify:
	•	permanent occupation without consent;
	•	covert control of another nation’s institutions;
	•	economic subjugation or dependency engineering;
	•	regime engineering by force, deception, or proxy action.

b. Sovereign Equality
All nations are equal in dignity, regardless of size, power, wealth, or internal system of governance.
Cooperation with a foreign nation does not constitute endorsement of its internal political structure.

c. Defensive Orientation
External alignment shall be defensive in nature and limited to purposes of:
	•	protecting the Republic and its People;
	•	preventing regional instability that poses a direct and material threat to the Republic;
	•	deterring aggression against peoples lawfully pursuing self-determination.

d. No Ideological Export
The Republic shall not seek to export ideology, doctrine, political systems, or cultural models through force, coercion, or inducement.
Assistance and cooperation shall respect the right of foreign peoples to determine their own political character.

e. Transparency and Accountability
All exercises of authority under this Article are subject to transparency, recordkeeping, and public accountability consistent with this Constitution.
Claims of foreign policy necessity shall not defeat constitutional limits.

Section 2. Sovereignty of Lawful Expression

a. Territorial Legal Sovereignty
Expression, publication, association, and dissemination of information that are lawful under the Constitution and laws of the Republic shall not be restricted, penalized, or suppressed at the demand of any foreign state, authority, institution, or proxy.

Lawfulness within the territory of the Republic shall be determined solely by the constitutional and statutory law of the Republic.

b. Prohibition on Extraterritorial Censorship
The Republic shall not recognize, enforce, assist, or give effect to any foreign law, judgment, regulation, fine, penalty, or demand that seeks to censor, compel, punish, or condition expression or information that is lawful within the Republic.

Technical feasibility of compliance, including geoblocking or localized suppression, shall not create an obligation to comply with foreign censorship demands.

c. Determination of Foreign Coercion
A foreign demand shall be deemed coercive where it seeks, through threat, penalty, exclusion, retaliation, or conditional access, to alter lawful expression or conduct within the Republic.

Determinations under this Section shall be subject to legislative oversight and judicial review.

d. Protection of Lawful Domestic Actors
The Republic shall defend, through lawful diplomatic, legal, and economic means, any person, entity, platform, or organization operating lawfully within its jurisdiction against foreign coercion or punitive action arising solely from lawful expression or conduct.

Defense under this Section includes, but is not limited to:
	•	diplomatic protest and formal objection;
	•	refusal of enforcement or recognition;
	•	reciprocal legal or economic countermeasures authorized by law;
	•	support for lawful domestic judicial proceedings challenging foreign penalties.

e. No Compelled Foreign Compliance
No domestic actor shall be required, as a condition of lawful operation within the Republic, to comply with foreign censorship regimes, speech codes, ideological restrictions, or informational controls that conflict with constitutional protections.

Self-censorship undertaken solely to satisfy foreign demands shall not be compelled, incentivized, or enforced by the Republic.

f. Proportional and Accountable Response
Responses under this Section shall be proportionate to the coercive action and shall be documented, transparent, and subject to legislative review.

Major retaliatory or economic measures require legislative authorization.

g. Personal Accountability of Foreign Actors
Foreign officials or agents responsible for unlawful censorship demands directed at lawful expression within the Republic may be subject to proportionate consequences, including denial of entry, restriction of privileges, or other lawful measures authorized by the Legislature.

h. Federal and Subnational Alignment
Subnational governments may enact complementary measures consistent with this Section to prevent enforcement of foreign censorship within their jurisdiction.

i. No Extraterritorial Assertion
Nothing in this Section shall be construed to regulate lawful expression within foreign jurisdictions or to compel foreign states to adopt the Republic’s standards of speech.

This Section exists to defend sovereignty, not to impose it.

Section 3. Cooperative Defense Agreements

a. Mutual Defense Only
The Republic may enter cooperative or mutual defense agreements with foreign states or associations solely for defensive purposes.
Such agreements shall exist to deter aggression, respond to armed attack, or address concrete threats to the safety of the Republic and its People.

b. Public Disclosure and Authorization
No cooperative defense agreement shall have force or effect unless:
	•	the full text is publicly disclosed;
	•	legislative approval is obtained prior to ratification;
	•	obligations, commitments, and limitations are clearly stated.

Secret treaties, undisclosed annexes, and informal security commitments are prohibited.

c. Limited and Defined Scope
All cooperative defense agreements shall specify, at minimum:
	•	geographic scope;
	•	duration and renewal conditions;
	•	command and control authority;
	•	limits on forces, resources, and operations;
	•	civilian oversight mechanisms.

Open-ended, indefinite, or geographically unbounded commitments are prohibited.

d. No Automatic War Obligation
No treaty, agreement, or alliance may compel the Republic to enter armed conflict without separate constitutional authorization.
Defense cooperation shall not substitute for the constitutional war powers of the Republic.

e. Prohibition on Offensive Mandates
The Republic shall not be bound by any agreement requiring participation in offensive war, regime change, coercive intervention, or military action undertaken for ideological, economic, or political objectives unrelated to direct defense.

f. Right of Withdrawal
The Republic retains the unconditional right to suspend or withdraw from any cooperative defense agreement upon legislative determination that the agreement:
	•	exceeds defensive purpose;
	•	compromises constitutional principles;
	•	exposes the Republic to unjustified risk;
	•	facilitates imperial drift or covert entanglement.

Withdrawal decisions and their justification shall be publicly disclosed.
g. Legitimacy Determination
Determinations of popular support and legitimate control shall be based on verifiable evidence and transparent criteria, including third-party monitoring or independent observation by non-aligned republics or credible neutral bodies where practicable, and shall be subject to legislative review.
h. Transparency of Implementation
All actions taken pursuant to cooperative defense agreements shall be documented, recorded, and subject to public and legislative oversight consistent with this Constitution.
Operational secrecy shall be limited strictly to immediate tactical necessity and shall not conceal the existence, scope, or legal basis of commitments.

Section 4. Assistance to Emerging or Reconstituting Republics

a. Eligibility for Assistance
The Republic may provide material, advisory, humanitarian, defensive, or reconstruction assistance to a foreign nation or people only where:
	•	the initiative for assistance originates domestically within the affected territory;
	•	popular support is demonstrated through transparent, verifiable means;
	•	the requesting authority exercises effective and legitimate control over the territory it claims to govern;
	•	assistance is openly requested and publicly acknowledged.

Eligibility determinations require legislative authorization and are subject to judicial review.

b. Presumption and Rebuttal of Legitimacy
Popular support and legitimate control shall be presumed absent clear and convincing evidence of fraud, coercion, suppression of opposition, or systemic manipulation.
The burden of rebuttal rests on the party asserting illegitimacy.

c. Conditional Assistance
Any assistance provided under this Section shall be conditional upon:
	•	adoption or restoration of a constitutional framework providing:
a. rule of law;
b. separation of powers;
c. protection of fundamental liberties;
d. civilian control of armed forces;
e. prohibition of corruption and parallel power structures;
	•	transparent use of aid and resources;
	•	independent auditing of assistance;
	•	defined timelines toward self-governance.

The Republic shall not fund, construct, or entrench tyranny.

d. No Mandatory Imitation
Assisted nations are not required to replicate the form of this Constitution.
They must, however, adhere in substance to republican governance, accountability, and popular sovereignty.
e. Automatic Suspension and Review
Suspension of assistance, advisory presence, or defense commitments shall be automatic upon a legislative finding by simple majority or upon confirmation by an independent audit that a triggering violation has occurred.
All active assistance programs shall be subject to mandatory review at least quarterly.

f. No Covert Assistance
All assistance under this Section shall be provided openly and lawfully.
Covert funding, intelligence operations, information warfare, or indirect manipulation are prohibited.

g. Periodic Review
All assistance programs are subject to periodic legislative review to determine continued eligibility, compliance, and alignment with constitutional principles.

Article XXIII — Mutual Republican Defense and Cooperative Alignment

Section 5. Prohibition of Regime Engineering

a. Absolute Prohibitions
No branch, agency, officer, or instrumentality of the Republic may:
	•	orchestrate coups or unlawful seizures of power;
	•	manipulate or subvert foreign elections or referenda;
	•	finance, train, direct, or coordinate foreign opposition movements covertly;
	•	engineer economic collapse, scarcity, or dependency to coerce political outcomes;
	•	destabilize governments for strategic, ideological, or economic gain;
	•	conduct or sponsor so-called “color revolutions” under any pretext.

Such acts constitute grave violations of constitutional duty.

b. Intelligence Restraint
Intelligence activities related to foreign nations shall be limited strictly to defensive information gathering necessary to protect the Republic.
Defensive intelligence gathering shall not include funding, training, directing, advising, or materially supporting foreign political actors, parties, movements, militias, media organizations, or civil institutions.

c. No Independent Foreign Policy
No intelligence or security body may conduct, direct, or substitute its own foreign policy for that lawfully determined by the constitutional branches.
Operations undertaken absent legislative authorization are void.

d. No Proxy Warfare
The Republic shall not wage war, conduct hostilities, or pursue strategic objectives through proxy forces, mercenary groups, private military contractors, or deniable intermediaries.

e. Consequences
Any agency or instrumentality that violates this Section acts against the constitutional order of the Republic.
Such violation warrants termination of the offending operation and subjects responsible individuals to removal and liability as provided by law.

Section 6. Private Foreign Activity and Non-Attribution

a. Private Action Distinguished
Nothing in this Article shall be construed to prohibit citizens, residents, or private organizations not acting on behalf of the Republic from engaging in lawful speech, association, advocacy, humanitarian activity, or political activity abroad in their personal or private capacity.

b. No State Attribution or Authority
Private foreign activity shall not be attributed to the Republic absent clear evidence of authorization, direction, funding, coordination, or material support by the Republic or its agents.
No private person or organization may claim to act on behalf of the Republic without explicit lawful authorization.

c. Assumption of Foreign Jurisdiction and Risk
Any person or organization engaging in private activity abroad does so subject to the laws, risks, and jurisdiction of the foreign territory in which such activity occurs.
No expectation of protection, assistance, or intervention by the Republic shall arise from private foreign activity.

d. Prohibition on Proxy Conduct
Private activity shall not be used to evade the prohibitions of this Article.
Any private conduct undertaken at the direction, encouragement, coordination, or material support of the Republic constitutes state action and is subject to all constitutional restrictions herein.

e. Extraordinary Diplomatic Discretion
Nothing in this Section prohibits the Republic from offering diplomatic assistance under extraordinary circumstances involving grave injustice, denial of due process, or threats to life, provided that such assistance does not legitimize or assume responsibility for the private conduct at issue.
f. Attribution of State Action
Clear evidence of material support, direction, coordination, or substantial assistance by the Republic to private persons or entities acting abroad constitutes state action under this Article, regardless of formal designation or intermediary use.
High-risk private foreign political or military assistance may be subject to registration or notification requirements as provided by law.


Section 7. Economic and Trade Cooperation

a. Fair Trade Doctrine
Trade and economic agreements entered into by the Republic shall:
	•	be publicly disclosed and subject to legislative approval;
	•	avoid dependency traps or coercive leverage;
	•	respect the sovereignty and lawful self-determination of participating nations;
	•	prohibit resource extraction, labor exploitation, or market access obtained through force, deception, or political coercion.

b. No Economic Justification for Tyranny
No alliance, aid program, trade agreement, or economic intervention may be justified by:
	•	commodity pricing;
	•	market stabilization;
	•	access to natural resources;
	•	corporate profit;
	•	financial speculation or systemic risk.

Economic convenience shall never excuse oppression, domination, or the subversion of popular sovereignty.

c. Transparency of Economic Alignment
All economic cooperation under this Article shall be documented, recorded, and subject to public and legislative review.
Secret trade commitments, undisclosed concessions, or informal economic guarantees are prohibited.

d. Right of Termination
The Republic retains the right to suspend or terminate economic cooperation where a participating entity engages in systemic corruption, coercion, or violations of human dignity inconsistent with republican principles.
e. Humanitarian assistance
Humanitarian assistance intended solely to prevent loss of life shall not be construed as political alignment, but shall not be used to influence governance, elections, or accession decisions.

Section 8. Republican Volunteers

a. Voluntary Assistance
Citizens and lawful residents of the Republic may voluntarily assist foreign peoples pursuing lawful self-determination, provided that such assistance:
	•	is undertaken openly and without deception;
	•	involves no coercion, force, or fraud;
	•	is not directed, funded, coordinated, or encouraged by any branch, agency, or instrumentality of the Republic;
	•	complies with the Constitution and laws of the Republic and does not constitute mercenarism, proxy warfare, or coercive force undertaken for compensation or state advantage;

b. Transparency and Notification
Voluntary assistance under this Section shall be subject to reasonable notification or registration requirements as established by law, solely for purposes of transparency and non-attribution.
Such requirements shall not constitute licensing, approval, or direction of private activity.

c. No Mercenarism or Proxy Forces
The Republic shall not sponsor, organize, fund, equip, or direct mercenary forces, private military contractors, or proxy armies.
Private armed activity undertaken for compensation or strategic effect is prohibited absent explicit legislative authorization.

d. No State Responsibility
Private voluntary assistance does not create any obligation, endorsement, or responsibility on the part of the Republic.
No claim of state protection, indemnification, or intervention shall arise from such activity.

e. Liability and Accountability
Persons acting under this Section bear full personal responsibility for their actions.
Nothing in this Section limits civil or criminal liability arising under domestic or foreign law.
f. Legitimacy and Foreign Criminalization

Criminalization of political dissent, republican advocacy, or nonviolent resistance by a foreign regime shall not, by itself, render private assistance illegitimate under this Article.

Nothing in this Section shall be construed to authorize private acts of terrorism, indiscriminate violence, or armed force undertaken for hire, profit, or strategic control.


Section 9. Oversight and Transparency

a. Legislative Authority
All foreign assistance, defense commitments, economic cooperation, and alignment undertaken pursuant to this Article require legislative authorization as provided by law.

b. Public Record
All actions taken under this Article shall be documented, preserved, and archived as public records.
The existence, scope, legal basis, and duration of such actions shall be subject to public disclosure, except where temporary nondisclosure is strictly necessary to address an immediate and concrete security risk.

c. Limited Operational Secrecy
Operational details may be withheld only where disclosure would pose an imminent risk to life, ongoing defensive operations, or the safety of persons.
Such nondisclosure shall be narrowly tailored, time-limited, and subject to subsequent public disclosure and legislative review.

d. No Informal or Undeclared Commitments
No branch, agency, or official of the Republic may create binding foreign obligations, security guarantees, or alignment commitments through informal understandings, executive assurances, or undisclosed arrangements.

e. Periodic Review
All active agreements, assistance programs, and cooperative actions under this Article shall be subject to periodic legislative review to determine continued necessity, compliance with constitutional principles, and alignment with the interests of the Republic.

f. Accountability for Concealment
Knowing concealment, misrepresentation, or omission of material facts relating to foreign alignment, assistance, or defense commitments constitutes a breach of constitutional duty and is subject to liability as provided by law.

Section 10. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to preserve the Republic as a non-imperial power, to restrain covert and unaccountable foreign entanglements, and to ensure that external action serves the safety, liberty, and constitutional integrity of the People.

a. Presumption Against Empire
Any ambiguity in the interpretation of this Article shall be resolved against imperial expansion, indirect domination, or permanent foreign entanglement.

b. Defense Over Influence
Defensive necessity shall not be conflated with ideological, economic, or strategic ambition.
Actions justified under this Article must be demonstrably defensive in purpose and proportional in scope.

c. No Deference to Secrecy or Expertise
Courts and oversight bodies shall not defer to assertions of foreign policy expertise, national prestige, alliance obligation, or classified necessity where such assertions conflict with the plain limits of this Article.

d. Integrated Constitutional Reading
This Article shall be read in harmony with Articles I, V, VI, VII, XI, and XX.
Where conflict arises, the interpretation that most restrains abuse of power and preserves republican self-government shall prevail.

e. Anti-Evasion Principle
Formal compliance that defeats the purpose of this Article constitutes violation.
Foreign policy actions structured to evade disclosure, authorization, or accountability are prohibited.

f. Self-Execution
This Article is self-executing in all its parts.
Failure of legislative or executive implementation shall not delay or diminish its force.

Section 11. Voluntary Accession to the Union

a. Right of Accession
Any foreign state, territory, or political entity may petition to join the Union of the Republic, in whole or in part, provided that:
	•	the petition is initiated by lawful authorities of that territory;
	•	popular consent is demonstrated through transparent, verifiable means;
	•	the territory agrees to submit fully to the Constitution of the Republic;
	•	all parallel sovereignties, militias, and legal systems are dissolved;
	•	allegiance to the Republic is exclusive and permanent.

Union is a covenant, not a convenience.

b. Campaigning for Union
The Republic may openly advocate, diplomatically encourage, and publicly promote accession to the Union through lawful means, including:
	•	diplomacy;
	•	trade incentives;
	•	cultural exchange;
	•	informational outreach;
	•	lawful political discourse.

Coercion, subversion, deception, or covert manipulation to induce accession is forbidden.

c. Congressional Authority
Accession requires approval by a supermajority of the Legislature and the adoption of a public accession charter defining:
	•	transitional governance arrangements;
	•	rights and obligations of the acceding population;
	•	citizenship pathways and eligibility criteria;
	•	integration timelines;
	•	security and defense arrangements.

No accession shall be rushed, concealed, or effected by executive action alone.
d. Permanence of Union

Accession to the Union constitutes permanent and irrevocable membership.

No state, territory, or political entity may secede, withdraw, dissolve its obligations, or claim a right of exit from the Republic except by constitutional amendment duly adopted or by the outcome of declared war.

Union is a covenant among peoples.
Disagreement does not dissolve it.

e. Judicial Review
Accession proceedings are subject to judicial review to ensure compliance with constitutional requirements, protection of fundamental rights, and the absence of coercion or fraud.

Section 12. Integration and Citizenship Risk Acknowledgment

a. Conscious Acceptance of Risk
The Republic acknowledges that voluntary accession necessarily entails the integration of new populations and the extension of rights, protections, and civic pathways.

Such integration carries inherent risk and responsibility, which shall not be used as a pretext to deny lawful accession once granted.

Yesterday Iberia; today Rome.

b. Transitional Status
Newly acceded territories may be governed under transitional administration for a defined and limited period, during which:
	•	civic education in constitutional principles is mandatory;
	•	institutional reform and harmonization are completed;
	•	eligibility for citizenship is phased according to law;
	•	hostile actors, parallel power structures, and unlawful militias are removed or prosecuted.

No permanent second-class status shall exist.

c. Equal Law Upon Completion
Upon completion of integration, all eligible residents of the acceded territory shall stand equal under the law, subject to the same duties, rights, and privileges as all other citizens of the Republic.

Discrimination, exclusion, or unequal status based on origin of accession is prohibited.

Section 13. Conquest in Defense of the Republic

a. Reserved Right of Conquest
Where a foreign territory:
	•	hosts a direct and material military threat to the Republic;
	•	facilitates overt or covert attacks against the Republic or its People;
	•	harbors forces, weapons, or infrastructure aimed at the Republic;
	•	engages in sustained hostile action after clear warning and demand for cessation;

the Republic reserves the right to use decisive military force, including conquest, solely to eliminate the threat.

Self-preservation is not imperialism.

b. Determination of Existential Threat
A determination that a foreign territory constitutes an existential threat requires:
	•	clear and convincing evidence;
	•	legislative authorization;
	•	public declaration of cause;
	•	judicial review of justification where practicable.

Economic inconvenience, ideological hostility, diplomatic friction, or speculative risk shall never suffice.

c. Limits on Authority Over Conquered Territory
Upon lawful conquest, the Republic shall possess authority only to the extent necessary to neutralize the threat and secure its People.

The Republic shall not claim permanent territorial sovereignty, annexation, or dominion over conquered territory unless the territory voluntarily petitions for accession pursuant to Section 11.

d. Permissible Post-Conquest Dispositions
Following neutralization of the threat, the Republic may, as determined by law:
	•	withdraw after securing demilitarization;
	•	establish a temporary civil administration with a fixed exit timetable;
	•	facilitate the formation of a reformed sovereign government;
	•	permanently demilitarize the territory;
	•	abandon the territory once the threat is eliminated.

No obligation exists to rebuild, occupy, or subsidize a hostile land beyond the security needs of the Republic.

e. No Automatic Citizenship
Conquest does not confer citizenship, residency, or political rights.
Eligibility for citizenship shall be determined solely under constitutional standards and transitional governance provisions.

f. Prohibition on Profit-Driven War
No military action or conquest may be undertaken:
	•	for resource acquisition;
	•	for corporate or private gain;
	•	to stabilize markets or currencies;
	•	to enrich arms industries;
	•	to launder public funds or authority.
	• 

Such actions constitute grave violations of constitutional duty.

g. Final Authority and Restraint
All decisions regarding conquered territory shall prioritize:
	•	safety of the People;
	•	long-term security of the Republic;
	•	constitutional integrity;
	•	avoidance of imperial entanglement.

The Republic conquers only to end threats, not to rule the unwilling. Conquest confers no permanent territorial claim, title, or right of annexation absent voluntary accession pursuant to Section 11, and shall never be undertaken for economic advantage, resource acquisition, or strategic exploitation.

Section 14. Post-Conquest Political Self-Determination

a. No Mandatory Political Reconstruction
The Republic shall not compel the adoption of its constitutional form, institutions, or political culture upon a conquered territory beyond what is strictly necessary to neutralize the threat and restore civil order.

Stabilization does not imply transformation.

b. Voluntary Determination of Political Future
Following the cessation of hostilities and restoration of basic security, the political future of a conquered territory shall be determined by its people through voluntary, transparent, and verifiable means.

No political outcome shall be presumed by virtue of conquest.

c. Option of Accession
Where a conquered territory demonstrates the capacity and desire for republican self-government, it may, after a period of stabilization, petition to join the Union pursuant to Section 11.

Accession shall require the freely expressed consent of the governed and shall not be induced by coercion, deprivation, threat, or continued military presence.

d. Option of Independent Governance
A conquered territory may elect to constitute itself as an independent sovereign government compatible with peaceful relations and security obligations, without obligation to accede to the Union.

The Republic shall not withhold withdrawal or assistance solely to influence this choice.

e. No Forced Alignment
The Republic shall not retain military, economic, or administrative control for the purpose of compelling accession, political imitation, ideological conformity, or permanent dependency.

f. Civic Determination and Eligibility Standards
Where a conquered territory proceeds to determine its political status under this Section, the Republic may require that such determination be conducted by an electorate meeting minimum civic standards consistent with republican self-government.

Such standards may include, by law:
	•	independence from armed groups, militias, or coercive authority;
	•	capacity to participate without intimidation, exclusion, or fraud;
	•	freedom from foreign allegiance or parallel sovereignty.

Eligibility standards shall be applied neutrally and shall not be based on race, ethnicity, religion, sex, or political belief.

These standards exist to ensure legitimate self-determination, not to entrench control, and shall dissolve upon accession to the Union or establishment of an independent sovereign government.

g. Equal Civic Voice and Corrective Safeguards
The Republic shall require the full and equal participation of women in any political determination conducted under this Section.

Where women, and other groups historically subjected to systemic exclusion from civic participation have been historically or systemically excluded, coerced, or prevented from political participation, the Republic shall mandate temporary corrective safeguards sufficient to ensure their voices are freely expressed and meaningfully counted.

Corrective safeguards may include protected voting processes, access to civic education and information, security against intimidation or retaliation, and participation thresholds preventing structural suppression.

No political determination shall be deemed legitimate under this Article if it reflects the exclusion or silencing of women.

h. Transitional Participation and Civic Development
Temporary participation in political determination under this Section shall not be construed as conferring citizenship, governing authority, or permanent civic qualification.

The purpose of transitional administration and participation is to expand civic capacity and eligibility among the population, not to permanently restrict participation or entrench exclusion.
