Article VIII-C — Systemic Confidence Exploitation 
	1.	The Republic recognizes systemic confidence exploitation as a distinct and grave form of economic predation.
	2.	Systemic confidence exploitation consists of repeated or patterned conduct designed to extract value through deception, emotional manipulation, false identity, manufactured trust, or asymmetric disclosure, particularly where such conduct targets vulnerability, dependency, or isolation.
	3.	Such conduct constitutes an attack on economic freedom, human dignity, and public trust, regardless of formal consent or contractual appearance.
	4.	The Republic affirms a compelling public interest in the proactive detection, investigation, and disruption of systemic confidence exploitation, including through pattern-based inquiry not dependent on individual victim reporting, subject to probable cause or equivalent constitutional standard.
	5.	No contractual waiver, arbitration clause, jurisdictional indirection, or organizational restructuring shall immunize systemic confidence exploitation from investigation or enforcement.
	6.	The identification, investigation, and adjudication of such conduct shall proceed only through lawful process and evidentiary standards, with constitutional compliance review by the Constitutional Review Court.
	7.	This Article is declaratory and reservational.
It authorizes no punishment beyond that provided by law, but denies any presumption of legitimacy to enterprises or actors whose business model relies on confidence exploitation.
