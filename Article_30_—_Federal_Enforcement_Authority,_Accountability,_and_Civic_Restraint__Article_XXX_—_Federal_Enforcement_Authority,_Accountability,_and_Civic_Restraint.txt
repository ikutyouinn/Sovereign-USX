Article XXX — Federal Enforcement Authority, Accountability, and Civic Restraint

Charge

Law enforcement is a necessary instrument of a lawful Republic—but it is also the most dangerous power entrusted to the state.

A Republic that tolerates abusive enforcement becomes a tyranny in uniform.
A Republic that permits unaccountable investigators, political police, or predatory revenue enforcers forfeits the consent of the governed.

This Article establishes federal enforcement authority by function rather than by name, ensures that no enforcement body is indispensable, permanent, or immune, and binds all federal enforcement to law, conscience, transparency, and service to the People.

Federal enforcement exists to uphold law—not to manufacture crime, terrorize the innocent, protect itself, or serve faction, party, ideology, or leader.

Emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence and advanced computational systems, shall be strictly subordinated to human accountability, constitutional limits, and public oversight to prevent new forms of unaccountable power.

Legal Text

Section 1. Federal Enforcement Functions

The Republic may maintain federal enforcement bodies solely for the following functions:

a. enforcement of federal criminal law within constitutionally enumerated jurisdiction;
b. investigation of offenses that exceed the lawful capacity or jurisdiction of individual states;
c. assistance to state, local, and tribal law enforcement upon request or lawful authorization;
d. investigation and enforcement of federal revenue, taxation, and financial obligations lawfully enacted;
e. protection of constitutional order against organized criminal activity, corruption, or interstate predation.

No federal enforcement authority exists beyond these functions.

Section 2. No Permanent Agencies; Functional Continuity

No federal enforcement body shall be constitutionally permanent, indispensable, or immune from dissolution.

The Legislature may, by law, dissolve, restructure, merge, replace, or reconstitute any federal enforcement body at any time, provided that lawful enforcement functions are preserved or reassigned.

No statute, regulation, collective agreement, or institutional tradition shall entitle any enforcement body to continued existence.

Institutions serve the Republic; the Republic does not serve institutions.

Section 3. Subordination to Civil Authority and the People

All federal enforcement personnel, systems, and leadership are subordinate to:

a. the Constitution;
b. the lawfully enacted statutes of the Republic;
c. judicial process and due process of law;
d. the People, through transparent and accountable governance.

No enforcement authority granted under this Article shall operate to override, suspend, or evade a lawful State nullification exercised pursuant to Article XXVIII-A.
No federal enforcement body shall pledge loyalty to any individual, officeholder, party, ideology, or faction.
No ideological, political, or religious loyalty test shall be imposed in hiring, promotion, retention, or assignment, except demonstrated fidelity to the Constitution and the law.

Section 4. Prohibition of Abusive Practices

Federal enforcement bodies are expressly prohibited from:

a. manufacturing, instigating, or provoking crimes for the purpose of arrest, prosecution, or statistics;
b. entrapment that would not occur absent government inducement;
c. use of honeypots, coercive informants, or fabricated conspiracies to create offenses;
d. enforcement quotas, revenue targets, or arrest benchmarks;
e. selective enforcement based on political belief, speech, religion, or lawful association;
f. intimidation, harassment, or punishment of individuals absent probable cause and due process.

Evidence obtained in violation of this Section shall be inadmissible, and responsible officials shall be subject to penalty under Article VII.

Section 4A. Separation of Intelligence and Law Enforcement

Domestic intelligence functions shall be structurally separated from law enforcement powers.

Any domestic intelligence body shall possess no arrest, detention, charging, or prosecutorial authority, and shall be limited to analysis, assessment, and lawful information sharing.

No entity may simultaneously exercise domestic intelligence functions and coercive enforcement powers.

Section 5. Revenue Enforcement Restraints

Enforcement of federal taxation and financial law shall be conducted with restraint, proportionality, and due process.

No federal revenue enforcement body shall:

a. presume guilt;
b. employ fear, complexity, or delay as instruments of coercion;
c. impose penalties absent clear statutory authorization and judicial review;
d. operate as a self-funding or self-justifying institution.

Revenue enforcement exists to uphold law, not to terrorize the citizenry or sustain itself.
No property shall be seized or forfeited absent criminal conviction of the owner for the offense giving rise to such forfeiture.

Section 6. Assistance to State and Local Authorities

Federal enforcement bodies may assist state, local, or tribal authorities only:

a. upon request;
b. pursuant to joint jurisdiction explicitly authorized by law; or
c. where interstate or federal interests are demonstrably implicated.

Federal assistance shall not override local authority, displace local command, or federalize ordinary crime.

Section 7. Transparency and Oversight

All federal enforcement bodies shall be subject to:

a. continuous legislative oversight;
b. public reporting of policies, aggregate actions, disciplinary outcomes, and use of advanced technologies;
c. independent audit of practices, outcomes, and algorithmic systems;
d. review by the Constitutional Review Court without deference where constitutional rights are implicated.
Secret law, undisclosed enforcement programs, unaccountable task forces, and opaque automated decision systems are prohibited.
Where recording technology is reasonably available, failure to record custodial encounters shall create a rebuttable presumption against admissibility and trigger mandatory review.

Section 8. Oaths and Ethical Obligation

All federal enforcement personnel shall swear an oath:

a. to uphold the Constitution;
b. to faithfully execute the law;
c. to respect the dignity and rights of all persons;
d. to act in accordance with conscience and moral responsibility.

The oath may acknowledge a higher moral authority according to the individual’s conscience, provided no religious test is imposed and no belief is compelled.

No oath shall bind enforcement personnel to unlawful orders.

Section 9. Individual Accountability

Federal enforcement personnel, senior officials, and system operators are individually accountable for unlawful acts.

Neither institutional affiliation, superior orders, national security claims, asserted necessity, nor algorithmic mediation shall excuse violations of constitutional rights.

Supervisory officials shall be liable where unlawful practices are systemic, tolerated, or concealed.

Qualified immunity shall not shield intentional or reckless misconduct.

Section 10. Use of Advanced Technologies in Enforcement

Any use of artificial intelligence, predictive analytics, surveillance algorithms, facial recognition, or future advanced computational systems in federal enforcement must:

a. be explicitly authorized by statute;
b. undergo independent, transparent validation for accuracy, bias, and constitutional compliance prior to deployment;
c. include auditable human-in-the-loop oversight, with final decisions reserved to accountable persons;
d. prohibit automated actions that deprive liberty or property without due process.

No such system may operate as a black box resistant to meaningful review.

Violations trigger suppression of evidence and mandatory suspension of the system. Such suppression and suspension shall be ordered by the Constitutional Review Court upon petition by any affected person, the CJC, or the Legislature.

Section 10A. Prohibition on Digital Entrapment and Manufactured Radicalization

Federal enforcement bodies are prohibited from:

a. creating, moderating, or participating in online forums, communications, or digital personas under false pretenses for the purpose of encouraging, escalating, or instigating criminal intent that would not otherwise exist;
b. grooming, nudging, or steering individuals or groups toward violent ideologies, criminal plans, or unlawful conduct through persistent interaction, amplification, or fabricated scenarios;
c. deploying bots, automated agents, or coordinated messaging to simulate extremist communities or manufacture evidence of predisposition absent concrete, pre-existing indicators of criminal intent.

Evidence obtained through violations of this Section shall be inadmissible, and responsible officials shall face personal civil and criminal liability under Article VII, including Tier Three penalties where systemic or intentional.

Section 10B. Automated Integrity Monitoring and Mandatory Referral

Artificial intelligence and advanced analytical systems may be employed to monitor federal enforcement bodies, personnel, leadership, and affiliated task forces for indicators of corruption, collusion, abuse of authority, or systemic constitutional violations.

Where such systems identify statistically extreme, multi-factor anomalies indicating a substantial risk of unlawful conduct, the system may generate an automated integrity referral.

Such referrals may be transmitted simultaneously to:

a. the Legislature;
b. the Constitutional Review Court;
c. the Constitutional Judicial Commission;
d. the appropriate prosecutorial authority.


No automated referral shall itself authorize investigation, prosecution, punishment, surveillance, or deprivation of rights.

Section 10C. Safeguards Governing Automated Referrals

All automated integrity monitoring and referral systems shall be subject to the following safeguards:

a. referrals shall be based on clearly defined, publicly disclosed criteria and thresholds;
b. systems shall provide an auditable explanation of the factors triggering referral;
c. all referrals shall be logged, preserved, and subject to independent audit;
d. human review shall be mandatory prior to any investigative or enforcement action;
e. no adverse action may be taken solely on algorithmic output;
f. scrutiny shall prioritize enforcement personnel and leadership over private citizens.

Automated systems shall not generate referrals based solely on political belief, religious belief, speech, association, or lawful activity.

Misuse of automated referral systems constitutes a grave offense under Article VII.

Section 10D. Institutional Integrity Enforcement

The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to investigate federal enforcement bodies for corruption, politicization, retaliation, concealment, or systemic abuse of authority.

Where such conditions are found, the CJC may petition the Constitutional Review Court for:
(a) injunctions;
(b) suspension or dissolution of units or systems;
(c) preservation and disclosure of records;
(d) disqualification of officials;
(e) Tier-Three remedies under Article VII.


Section 11. Leadership Tenure, Rotation, and Cooling Periods

Congress shall, by law, establish reasonable maximum terms of service for senior leadership positions within federal enforcement bodies to ensure experience without institutional entrenchment.

No individual shall hold senior enforcement leadership authority for a duration sufficient to create de facto permanence, personal fiefdoms, or institutional capture.

A mandatory cooling-off period shall apply between service in senior enforcement leadership and elected office, and between elected office and senior enforcement leadership, as provided by law.

Nothing in this Section bars any person from public service; rotation is required solely to prevent consolidation of coercive power.

Section 12. Dissolution and Replacement for Cause

Where a federal enforcement body demonstrates systemic abuse, corruption, politicization, loss of public trust, or misuse of advanced technologies, the Legislature shall have an affirmative duty to dissolve or reconstitute that body.

Replacement shall preserve lawful functions while terminating institutional pathology.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to certify when such conditions exist, and the Constitutional Review Court may compel compliance with this duty.

Section 13. Standing and Remedies

Any Civic Citizen, lawful resident, or state with standing may challenge violations of this Article.

The Constitutional Review Court may order:

a. injunctive relief;
b. suppression of unlawfully obtained evidence;
c. dissolution or restructuring of enforcement bodies or systems;
d. damages and personal liability where appropriate.

Section 14. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to:

a. favor liberty over enforcement convenience;
b. favor justice over institutional preservation;
c. prevent the emergence of political police or technological surveillance states;
d. ensure enforcement remains a servant, never a master;
e. subordinate emerging technologies to human conscience, constitutional limits, and public accountability.
No enforcement authority conferred by this Article shall be exercised to override, suspend, or evade a lawful State nullification pursuant to Article XXVIII-A, including during declared emergencies.
Emergency enforcement powers are limited to execution of expressly enumerated federal powers and do not create new authority.

The Republic shall not be governed by fear of its own agents—whether human or algorithmic.
