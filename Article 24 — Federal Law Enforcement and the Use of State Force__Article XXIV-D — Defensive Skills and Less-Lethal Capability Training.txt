Article XXIV-D — Defensive Skills and Less-Lethal Capability Training

Section 1. Purpose.
The Republic requires continuous, hands-on defensive training for officers who exercise arrest, detention, or coercive authority so that officers can lawfully control violent resistance without defaulting to lethal force.

Section 2. Applicability.
This Article applies to any sworn officer or agent who, under color of law, carries a firearm or exercises authority to detain, arrest, restrain, transport, or contain persons on behalf of (i) the Republic, or (ii) any State or subdivision exercising police powers. No agency may assign armed field duty to a covered officer who fails to satisfy the requirements of this Article.

Section 3. Minimum Training Time Requirement.
Each covered officer shall complete not less than four (4) hours of paid, on-duty defensive-skills training during each block of five (5) shifts worked. The Legislature may permit equivalent scheduling that preserves the same minimum ratio of training time to shifts, provided that an agency may not average the requirement over more than thirty (30) calendar days.

Section 4. Approved Training Pathways.
Each agency shall provide, at the officer’s option and subject to safety screening, one or more of the following training pathways:
(a) Military Defensive Control Track. Instruction delivered by qualified military trainers limited to combatives, restraint, control, weapon-retention, team control, and safe apprehension. This track shall not include warfighting doctrine, population-control doctrine, or domestic combat tactics prohibited elsewhere in Article XXIV.
(b) Combat Sports Track. Instruction delivered by certified coaches in MMA or equivalent physical-defense systems, including without limitation wrestling, judo, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, boxing, Muay Thai, and integrated defensive tactics focused on control, disengagement, and safe restraint.
(c) Equivalent Defensive Tactics Track. An evidence-informed program that meets the minimum curriculum in Section 5 and the certification and audit requirements in Section 8.
(d) Veteran Instructor and Service Track. Instruction delivered by qualified military veterans hired or contracted to lead agency training staff and, where otherwise eligible, to serve as officers. Eligibility for this pathway shall be based on objective qualifications verified by records, including one or more of the following:
    (i) documented completion of recognized military courses in close-quarters control, combatives, restraint, detainee handling, weapon retention, or use-of-force discipline;
    (ii) documented prior service in an official instructor role for military combatives, defensive tactics, use-of-force, or detainee operations;
    (iii) current certification in relevant civilian coaching or instructional credentials (including certified coaches or instructors in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, judo, wrestling, boxing, Muay Thai, or equivalent systems), in addition to verified service; or
    (iv) other objectively verifiable training and experience substantially equivalent to (i)–(iii) as defined by statute.
All instruction under this track shall comply with the Anti-Militarization Safeguard in Section 7 and shall remain focused on lawful control, restraint, and reduced lethality in domestic policing.
(e) Instructor Qualifications. Each agency shall maintain and publish aggregate data on instructor qualifications and staffing, including the proportion of training hours led by certified civilian coaches, certified defensive-tactics instructors, and qualified veterans under Section 4(d). Individual identities may be withheld for personal security, but credentials, verification method, and role category shall be auditable.
No eligibility criterion may reference unit prestige, publicity, or informal status; eligibility shall rest on documented training, instructor roles, or objectively verifiable equivalent experience only.
Section 5. Minimum Curriculum.
Each pathway shall train and assess, at minimum:
(a) distance management, clinch entry and exit, and controlled takedowns;
(b) ground control, positional stabilization, and safe handcuffing under resistance;
(c) team-based restraint that minimizes injury and avoids positional asphyxia risk;
(d) weapon retention, holster protection, and safe disengagement protocols;
(e) transitions to and from less-lethal tools, including lawful limitations and safe deployment;
(f) decision-making under stress, including recognition of when to disengage, contain, or wait for backup;
(g) immediate post-restraint medical assessment and duty-to-render-aid procedures consistent with constitutional and statutory obligations.

Section 6. Scenario Drills.
Each agency shall include scenario-based drills that reflect real constraints, including low light, confined spaces, multiple officers, bystanders, and communication under stress. Each scenario shall train de-escalation, lawful containment, and safe restraint as the first resort where feasible.

Section 7. Anti-Militarization Safeguard.
Training under this Article shall increase less-lethal capability and lawful control, not militarize domestic enforcement. No agency may use compliance with this Article to justify acquisition of prohibited military equipment, adoption of battlefield command structures, or routine warfighting tactics barred by Article XXIV.

Section 8. Certification, Records, and Audit.
Each agency shall:
(a) certify completion and proficiency at least annually, using objective, documented criteria;
(b) maintain immutable training-hour logs and proficiency records for each covered officer;
(c) submit the program, standards, and aggregate compliance rates to independent audit at intervals established by law;
(d) publish aggregate compliance and audit results, with redactions limited to personal medical privacy and operational security narrowly defined by law.

Section 9. Medical Safety and Accommodation.
Agencies shall screen for medical safety and shall provide reasonable accommodations for disability without nullifying the core purpose of this Article. Where an officer cannot safely complete a physical-control curriculum, the agency shall restrict that officer from armed field duty and from direct apprehension roles unless and until the officer satisfies an approved equivalent standard that preserves public safety and reduces reliance on lethal force.

Section 10. Enforcement.
Any person shall have standing to seek injunctive relief compelling agency compliance with this Article. An agency’s knowing, systemic evasion of this Article constitutes a breach of public trust and triggers remedies as provided by law, including removal of responsible officials and personal liability for willful falsification of compliance records.
