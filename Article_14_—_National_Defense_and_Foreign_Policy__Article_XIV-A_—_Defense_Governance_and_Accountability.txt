Article XIV-A — Defense Governance and Accountability

Section 1. Non-Derogation and Relationship to Article XIV

This Article supplements Article XIV — National Defense and Foreign Policy.

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to expand war powers, diminish civilian supremacy, or weaken the constraints imposed by Article XIV.

Where doubt exists, the construction that most restricts unaccountable force shall control.

Section 2. Civilian Supremacy and Unified Command

All military and defense institutions remain subordinate to civilian authority.

No military, intelligence, or security body may exercise independent political authority, initiate hostilities, or define national policy.

Fragmentation of command to evade accountability is prohibited.

⸻

Section 3. Defense Procurement and Anti-Capture Doctrine

Defense procurement shall be transparent, competitive, and subject to continuous audit.

Prohibited practices include:
	1.	revolving-door inducements;
	2.	cost-plus structures without strict justification;
	3.	concealed subcontracting;
	4.	classified procurement used to suppress oversight.

Systemic procurement abuse constitutes capture of the war power.

Section 4. Intelligence Boundaries and Military Separation

Intelligence services shall support, not direct, military operations.

No intelligence body may:
	1.	initiate force;
	2.	conduct lethal operations absent lawful authorization;

Intelligence is informational, not sovereign.

Section 5. Prohibition on Permanent or Private Militaries

Standing armed forces shall exist only under constitutional authorization.

Private military forces, mercenary organizations, or deniable proxy forces acting on behalf of the Republic are prohibited.

Delegation of violence to evade constitutional limits constitutes grave misconduct.

Section 6. Treatment of Service Members

Members of the armed forces remain citizens under law.

They retain:
	•	the duty to refuse unlawful orders;
	•	access to independent judicial review;
	•	protection from retaliation for lawful refusal.

No oath may bind service members to unconstitutional action.

⸻

Section 7. Veterans’ Obligations and Care

The Republic owes lifelong duty of care to those injured, disabled, or traumatized in its service.

Failure to provide adequate medical, psychological, and social support constitutes breach of public trust.

Veterans shall not be abandoned after lawful service.

Section 8. Transparency, Records, and Historical Accountability

Defense actions, procurement decisions, and intelligence-military coordination shall be preserved as public records, subject only to narrow and temporary classification.

Permanent secrecy regarding acts of force is prohibited.

This Section operates in coordination with Articles XI and XXXIX.

⸻

Section 9. Enforcement and Severity

Willful violation of this Article by public officials, commanders, or institutions constitutes abuse of constitutional authority.

Where such conduct involves concealment, unauthorized force, or systemic harm, it qualifies as a grave offense under Article 0 and is subject to Tier-3 escalation.

⸻

Section 10. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to ensure that force remains accountable, intelligence remains bounded, service remains honored, and war remains the exception rather than the norm.
