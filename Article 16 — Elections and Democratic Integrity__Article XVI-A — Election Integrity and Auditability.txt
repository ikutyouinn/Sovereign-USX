Article XVI-A — Election Integrity and Auditability

Section 1. Non-Derogation and Relationship to Article XVI

This Article supplements Article XVI — Elections and Democratic Legitimacy.

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to modify, narrow, relax, or reinterpret any requirement, prohibition, or safeguard established in Article XVI.

Where doubt exists, the construction that most preserves electoral legitimacy and public trust shall control.

Section 2. Chain-of-Custody as a Constitutional Requirement

All ballots, records, and election materials shall be subject to continuous, documented chain-of-custody from issuance through final certification.

Any break, ambiguity, or undocumented transfer in custody creates a rebuttable presumption of compromise.

Chain-of-custody records shall be public records.

⸻

Section 3. Auditability and Public Verification

All elections shall be auditable by independent observers using methods that are:
	1.	publicly observable,
	2.	repeatable,
	3.	comprehensible to a reasonable citizen,
	4.	independent of proprietary claims.

No election outcome may rely exclusively on processes that cannot be meaningfully audited by human review.

⸻

Section 4. Technology Neutrality and Burden of Proof

No voting or tabulation technology is presumed valid by default.

The burden of proof rests on the authority employing any technology to demonstrate:
	1.	transparency,
	2.	resistance to tampering,
	3.	verifiability independent of vendor assertions,
	4.	absence of remote or covert alteration capability.

Failure to meet this burden prohibits use.

⸻

Section 5. Software and Vendor Restrictions

Election software, firmware, and tabulation systems shall be:
	1.	open to inspection,
	2.	version-controlled,
	3.	publicly documented,
	4.	reproducible from source where applicable.

Proprietary secrecy shall not defeat audit, review, or challenge.

Vendor indemnification clauses shall not shield liability for failure, fraud, or concealment.

⸻

Section 6. Escalation Triggers and Automatic Review

The following conditions automatically trigger mandatory review, recount, or escalation:
	1.	material chain-of-custody defects;
	2.	statistically anomalous results inconsistent with observable conditions;
	3.	equipment malfunction affecting outcome margins;
	4.	documented interference or suppression.

Discretionary refusal to review under such conditions is prohibited.
Where escalation is triggered under this Section, the Constitutional Review Court shall have mandatory and expedited jurisdiction to order audits, recounts, preservation of evidence, and injunctions against certification.

⸻

Section 7. Failure Resolution and Election Invalidation

Where integrity defects cannot be cured through audit or recount, the affected election or contest shall be invalidated.

Certification shall not occur where legitimacy cannot be affirmatively demonstrated.

No authority may certify an election solely to preserve continuity or convenience.

⸻

Section 8. Remedies and Temporary Governance

In the event of invalidation:
	1.	lawful interim governance shall proceed under existing constitutional succession rules;
	2.	prompt re-election shall occur under corrected conditions;
	3.	emergency powers shall not be invoked to bypass re-election.

Continuity does not justify legitimacy failure.

⸻

Section 9. Accountability and Severity

Willful interference with election integrity, auditability, or review constitutes abuse of democratic authority.

Where such conduct is systemic, coordinated, or outcome-determinative, it qualifies as a grave offense under Article 0 and is subject to Tier-3 escalation.

⸻

Section 10. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to ensure that electoral outcomes are provable, not presumed.

Where doubt exists, the construction that favors verification over finality shall control.
