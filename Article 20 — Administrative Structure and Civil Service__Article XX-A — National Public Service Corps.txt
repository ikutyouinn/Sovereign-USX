Article XX-A — National Public Service Corps

Section 1. Establishment and Purpose

The Republic may establish a National Public Service Corps as a civilian institution dedicated to voluntary service in furtherance of public welfare, civic resilience, and intergenerational stewardship.

The Corps exists to cultivate practical competence, shared responsibility, and constructive contribution to the Republic, without militarization, compulsion, or ideological conformity.

⸻

Section 2. Civilian and Non-Coercive Character

The National Public Service Corps shall be strictly civilian in nature.
	1.	Participation shall be voluntary.
	2.	No person shall be compelled to serve as a condition of citizenship, voting, education, employment, or access to public benefits.
	3.	The Corps shall not be organized, trained, or deployed as a military or paramilitary force.

Nothing in this Article authorizes conscription or forced labor.

⸻

Section 3. Relationship to Citizenship and Civic Formation

Service in the Corps may be recognized by law as a form of honorable civic contribution.

Such recognition may include educational credit, professional training, or public acknowledgment, but shall not create a privileged civic class or abridge the equal rights of non-participants.

Service shall complement, not replace, civic education as provided in Article XVIII.

⸻

Section 4. Scope of Authorized Service

The National Public Service Corps may undertake service activities authorized by law that are consistent with this Constitution, including but not limited to:
	•	environmental stewardship and land enrichment;
	•	infrastructure maintenance and resilience;
	•	disaster preparedness and recovery;
	•	public health support;
	•	skills training and community assistance.

No service activity may be authorized that violates individual rights, due process, or constitutional limits.

⸻

Section 5. Relationship to Private Duty and Local Authority

The Corps shall not be used to:
	1.	substitute for private legal duties imposed under Article IX;
	2.	displace lawful private labor through coercion or unfair competition;
	3.	override local land use authority or community consent.

Service activities shall proceed, where applicable, in cooperation with local governments, landholders, and communities.

⸻

Section 6. Prohibitions

The National Public Service Corps shall not:
	1.	enforce law, conduct investigations, or exercise police powers;
	2.	regulate land, industry, or speech;
	3.	engage in political advocacy or partisan activity;
	4.	impose ideological instruction as a condition of service;
	5.	serve as a pretext for land seizure, population relocation, or social control.

Any attempt to repurpose the Corps for such ends is unconstitutional.

⸻

Section 7. Organization and Oversight

The organization, administration, and funding of the National Public Service Corps shall be prescribed by law, subject to:
	1.	transparency requirements;
	2.	civilian oversight;
	3.	public audit;
	4.	judicial review.

No emergency authority may expand the powers or scope of the Corps beyond what is authorized under ordinary law.

⸻

Section 8. Interaction with Other Articles

This Article shall be construed in harmony with:
	•	Article IX (Land, Homesteading, and Agricultural Duty),
	•	Article XVIII (Civic Formation and Education),
	•	Article XX-B (Sustainable Forestry, Agroforestry, and Land Enrichment),
	•	Article XV (Locks and Anti-Emergency Drift).

Where doubt exists, the construction that most preserves voluntariness, civilian character, and constitutional restraint shall control.

⸻

Section 9. Interpretation

The National Public Service Corps is an instrument of service, not governance.

It shall be interpreted as a means of enabling constructive civic contribution, not as a vehicle for compulsion, ideology, or administrative overreach.
