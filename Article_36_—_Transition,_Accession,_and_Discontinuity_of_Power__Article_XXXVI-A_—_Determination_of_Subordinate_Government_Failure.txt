Article XXXVI-A — Determination of Subordinate Government Failure

Section 1. Presumption of Local Self-Governance

Subordinate governments are presumed capable of lawful self-governance.
Such presumption may be rebutted only upon clear and convincing evidence, through the procedures set forth herein.

⸻

Section 2. Federal Investigative Trigger

Where credible, corroborated evidence indicates that a subordinate government has materially abdicated its civic responsibilities or is acting in a criminal or hostile manner toward the People or the Republic, the Federal Government shall have authority to initiate an independent investigation, notwithstanding the absence of a local petition.

Credible evidence may include, but is not limited to:
	1.	verified financial records;
	2.	judicial findings or indictments;
	3.	independent audits;
	4.	intelligence lawfully obtained and declassified to the maximum extent possible;
	5.	patterns of violent crime, infrastructure collapse, or rights violations demonstrable by objective metrics.

Investigative initiation does not constitute intervention and confers no governing authority.

⸻

Section 3. Independent Investigation

Any investigation under this Article shall:
	1.	be conducted by an independent federal body insulated from political direction;
	2.	be limited in scope and duration;
	3.	produce a public evidentiary report, subject to redaction only where strictly necessary to protect life or ongoing prosecutions;
	4.	be subject to judicial supervision upon petition.

Failure to meet evidentiary sufficiency terminates the process.

⸻

Section 4. Formal Adjudication

Upon a finding of sufficient evidence, the subordinate government entity shall be formally charged and brought before the Constitutional Review Court.

The proceeding shall:
	1.	be adversarial;
	2.	afford full due process;
	3.	permit defense by the accused governing body;
	4.	require proof by clear and convincing evidence.

Emergency declarations under Article XXXVIII do not substitute for this adjudication.

⸻

Section 5. Grounds for Conviction

Conviction may occur only upon proof of one or more of the following, shown to be systemic and persistent:
	1.	Abdication of Governance — sustained failure to enact or execute lawful governance.
	2.	Criminal Capture — demonstrable subordination to organized crime or corruption.
	3.	Hostile Governance — deliberate action against the constitutional order or the rights of the People.
	4.	Public Safety Collapse — sustained inability or refusal to protect life.
	5.	Rights Breakdown — material violations of inviolable rights not remediable by ordinary judicial relief.
	6.	Infrastructure Dereliction — collapse rendering basic habitation or mobility untenable.

⸻

Section 6. Consequences of Conviction

Upon conviction:
	1.	the offending governing body shall be dissolved or suspended;
	2.	authority shall be transferred to temporary, court-approved stewards;
	3.	individual officials found culpable shall:
	•	face all applicable criminal penalties;
	•	be permanently barred from public office;
	•	forfeit civic citizenship where constitutionally permitted under Article III.

Collective punishment of residents is prohibited.

⸻

Section 7. Nature of Stewardship

Stewardship imposed under this Article shall be:
	1.	temporary;
	2.	narrowly tailored to failed functions;
	3.	subject to periodic judicial review;
	4.	bound by a mandatory restoration plan.

Stewards hold authority in trust, not sovereignty.

⸻

Section 8. Relationship to Intervention

A conviction under this Article establishes eligibility for temporary remedial action under Article XXXIV-B, and for no other purpose.

No military force, federal policing, or emergency powers may be exercised absent independent authorization under Articles XXIV, XXX, or XXXVIII.

⸻

Section 9. Construction

This Article shall be construed:
	•	in favor of decisiveness where evidence is overwhelming,
	•	in favor of due process where evidence is contested,
	•	against permanent federal control,
	•	against political or partisan application.

Failure of governance is a legal condition, not a moral identity.
