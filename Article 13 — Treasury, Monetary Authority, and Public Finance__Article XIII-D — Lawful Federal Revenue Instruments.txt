Article XIII-D — Lawful Federal Revenue Instruments
 Charge
The Republic shall fund the lawful operation of the federal government through transparent, proportionate, and non-extractive revenue instruments that attach to privilege, risk, harm, or voluntary use, rather than to mere existence, labor, or subsistence.
This Article clarifies and limits the authority of the federal government to collect fees, levies, fines, tariffs, and cost recoveries, while prohibiting disguised taxation, revenue maximization, and encroachment upon state authority over redistribution.

Section 1. Authorized Non-Tax Revenue Instruments
The Republic may collect non-tax revenues, including:
(a) licensing and permitting fees for regulated, privileged, or high-risk activity; (b) corporate charter issuance, renewal, maintenance, and compliance fees; (c) user fees for access to national infrastructure, systems, records, spectrum, or commons at scale; (d) fines, penalties, forfeitures, and clawbacks arising from violations of this Constitution or law; (e) cost recovery for litigation, investigations, audits, enforcement, adjudication, and remediation reasonably attributable to regulated conduct; (f) reasonable tariffs and border adjustments necessary to preserve fair trade, sound money, fiduciary parity, or domestic legal standards.
Revenue instruments under this Section shall not be construed as general taxation.

Section 2. Proportionality and Reasonableness Test
All fees, levies, fines, tariffs, and charges imposed under this Article shall satisfy a constitutional proportionality test.
A revenue instrument is lawful only where it is:
(a) reasonably related to a granted privilege, imposed risk, measurable harm, or specific public cost; (b) calibrated to recover costs, price risk, or remediate harm rather than maximize revenue; (c) transparent, published, and subject to public audit; (d) non-discriminatory among similarly situated parties; (e) incapable, in design or effect, of functioning as a disguised income, wealth, capitation, or consumption tax.
Revenue instruments that materially burden subsistence activity, ordinary labor, or non-commercial personal use are prohibited.

Section 3. Prohibition on Disguised Taxation and Revenue Maximization
Charges imposed under this Article shall not be varied, escalated, or justified on the basis of moral disapproval, social stigma, status signaling, or behavioral deterrence goals unrelated to proportional cost recovery, risk pricing, or remediation of concrete public harm.
No fee, levy, fine, tariff, or charge may be structured, escalated, or administered primarily for the purpose of general revenue generation, fiscal expansion, or behavioral coercion unrelated to a lawful regulatory, remedial, or cost-recovery objective.
Any revenue instrument whose primary effect is to extract general funds absent a nexus to privilege, harm, or cost shall be void.

Section 4. Judicial Review and Standing
Any person or entity subject to a charge under this Article has standing to challenge its constitutionality, including on grounds of excessiveness, arbitrariness, discrimination, lack of proportionality, or use as a disguised tax.
Courts shall review such challenges without deference.
Conversely, any attempt to evade lawful fees, fines, tariffs, or cost recovery through jurisdictional arbitrage, shell entities, artificial restructuring, or misclassification constitutes fiscal misconduct and may result in forfeiture of associated privileges, protections, or claims under law.

Section 5. Relationship to Taxation and State Authority
Nothing in this Article authorizes the federal government to impose general income taxation, wealth taxation, payroll taxation, or redistribution.
States retain exclusive authority over income redistribution, social spending, and general taxation, subject to this Constitution.
This Article shall be construed in harmony with Articles VIII, X, XIII-A, XIII-B, XIII-C, and XXXIX.

Section 6. Construction and Lock Protection
This Article shall be construed narrowly to preserve a limited federal fiscal footprint, prevent stealth taxation, and ensure that public power is funded by those who impose costs, extract value, or enjoy special privilege.
The prohibitions on general taxation, disguised taxation, revenue maximization, and non-proportional charges are structurally protected under Article XV. Only these limits, and not the enumerated instruments themselves, are subject to lock protection.
