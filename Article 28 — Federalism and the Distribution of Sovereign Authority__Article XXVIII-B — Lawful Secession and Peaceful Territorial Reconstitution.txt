Article XXVIII-B — Lawful Secession and Peaceful Territorial Reconstitution

Charge

The Republic is founded on consent, not force.
No political union remains legitimate when maintained only by coercion.

At the same time, no community may shatter the Republic by impulse, faction, or fraud.

This Article provides the sole lawful path by which a State or defined territory may withdraw from the Republic — not as rebellion, but as an act of peaceful self-determination, conducted with restraint, protection of minorities, and preservation of human dignity.

⸻

Section 1. Prohibition on Unilateral Secession

No State, territory, or subdivision may unilaterally secede from the Republic.

No declaration, referendum, legislative act, or executive order shall have legal force unless conducted strictly in accordance with this Article.

Any attempt to secede outside this framework constitutes insurrection and is void.

⸻

Section 2. Threshold for Secession Petition

A State may initiate the secession process only upon:

(a) a petition approved by at least sixty percent (60%) of registered voters in a statewide referendum;
(b) certification that the referendum was conducted under free, fair, and transparent conditions;
(c) judicial confirmation that no coercion, suppression, or foreign interference tainted the vote.

The question submitted shall explicitly state that secession entails full loss of representation, federal protection, and constitutional entitlements.

⸻

Section 3. Cooling-Off and Reconfirmation Period

Upon initial approval, a mandatory cooling-off period of five (5) years shall begin.

During this period:
	•	the State shall remain fully subject to the Constitution,
	•	negotiations may occur,
	•	grievances shall be formally documented and addressed.

At the conclusion of this period, a second referendum shall be held requiring the same 60% threshold.

Failure to reconfirm terminates the secession process.

⸻

Section 4. Federal Negotiation Duty

Upon successful reconfirmation, the Federal Government shall enter good-faith negotiations to determine:
	•	division of public property and debt;
	•	citizenship status of residents;
	•	pensions, benefits, and military obligations;
	•	borders and infrastructure;
	•	continuation or termination of treaties and compacts.

Negotiations shall prioritize:
	•	continuity of daily life,
	•	economic stability,
	•	and protection of human rights.

⸻

Section 5. Protection of Minorities and Dissenters

Any region, county, or contiguous population within the seceding State that votes against secession by a 60% supermajority shall have the right to:
	•	remain in the Republic;
	•	form a new State;
	•	or join an adjacent State.

No person shall be forced into secession against their will.

Borders shall be drawn to minimize displacement and protect community integrity.

⸻

Section 6. Individual Citizenship Choice

Every resident of the seceding territory shall retain the right to:
	•	remain a citizen of the Republic,
	•	acquire citizenship of the new polity,
	•	or hold dual status if agreed by treaty.

No person shall become stateless.

No person shall be punished for their choice.

⸻

Section 7. Continuity of Rights

All persons within the seceding territory shall retain:
	•	their property rights,
	•	contracts,
	•	pensions,
	•	and accrued legal claims.

No collective forfeiture or confiscation is permitted.

⸻

Section 8. Prohibition on Armed Secession

No armed force, militia, or security apparatus may:
	•	compel participation,
	•	suppress dissent,
	•	or enforce secession.

Any use of force to effect or resist lawful secession outside constitutional authority constitutes a Tier-Three offense.

⸻

Section 9. International Status

A seceding State shall not be recognized as independent until this Article is fully satisfied and a final treaty of separation is ratified by both governments.

Foreign recognition prior to lawful completion is void.

⸻

Section 10. Relationship to Nullification and Partition

Secession under this Article is distinct from:
	•	lawful nullification under Article XXVIII-A;
	•	internal partition under Article XXVIII-C.

Nullification addresses unconstitutional acts.
Partition addresses internal State breakdown.
Secession addresses irreconcilable sovereign divergence.

No process may be used to bypass another.

⸻

Section 11. Judicial Review

All stages of the secession process shall be subject to continuous judicial review by the Constitutional Review Court, with appellate review by the Supreme Court of the Republic.

Such review shall ensure, at all times, that:

(a) the consent of the affected population is free, informed, and uncoerced;
(b) the rights and protections of political, ethnic, religious, and regional minorities are preserved; and
(c) all actions taken remain in full compliance with this Constitution.

⸻

Section 12. Lock Protection

This Article is LOCK-PROTECTED pursuant to Article XV.

No emergency, statute, treaty, or judicial doctrine may:
	•	weaken its thresholds,
	•	shorten its timelines,
	•	remove minority exit rights,
	•	or authorize unilateral separation.

The Republic shall not be dissolved by haste, nor preserved by force.
