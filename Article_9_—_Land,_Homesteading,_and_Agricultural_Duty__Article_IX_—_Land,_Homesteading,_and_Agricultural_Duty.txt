Article IX — Land, Homesteading, and Agricultural Duty

Charge
This Article establishes constitutional rules governing land ownership, use, stewardship, and agricultural policy within the Republic. All provisions of this Article shall be construed to promote productive use, environmental stewardship, long-term sustainability, and broad access to land for lawful residence and cultivation. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to authorize land restriction, forfeiture, or redistribution except as expressly provided by law and subject to constitutional safeguards.

Legal Text

Section 1. Stewardship of Land

(a) Duty of Stewardship
The land, waters, soil, and natural systems of the Republic are held in sacred trust for the People and for future generations.
All land within the Republic shall be held subject to a duty of stewardship. Ownership of land confers not only rights, but obligations to use, maintain, and preserve land in a manner consistent with the long-term welfare of the People, the environment, and future generations.
Land is not a purely speculative instrument, nor an object of neglect; it is a public trust held in private hands. For purposes of this Article, beneficial ownership, control, coordination, or common management shall be aggregated, regardless of legal form or number of entities involved.
For purposes of stewardship, responsible land use may include the maintenance of forest health, soil stability, watershed protection, and reasonable mitigation of known ecological or fire risks, consistent with evidence and due process.
Stewardship shall have the meaning given in Article 0: the fiduciary duty of officials, landholders, and institutions to preserve and enhance these resources for long-term welfare, subject to enforcement as a constitutional obligation.
Neglect, waste, soil depletion, or predatory exploitation that materially weakens the Republic or future generations constitutes a grave offense (cross-reference Article 0; Article VII Tier Three offenses; Article I §9).
Stewardship obligations apply equally to individuals, corporations, trusts, religious bodies, and any coordinated ownership structure.
(b) Definition of Stewardship
Stewardship shall require that land be:
	•	maintained in safe, habitable, or productive condition appropriate to its zoning and designation;
	•	protected against intentional degradation, abandonment, or waste;
	•	free from prolonged neglect that creates public harm, blight, environmental damage, or artificial scarcity;
	•	used in good faith for habitation, agriculture, commerce, conservation, or public benefit.

Nominal, sham, or token use designed solely to evade stewardship obligations shall not satisfy this duty.

(c) Prohibited Conduct
The following constitute violations of stewardship:
	•	prolonged abandonment without just cause;
	•	deliberate deterioration or stripping of land or structures;
	•	hoarding land or housing to manipulate scarcity or price;
	•	allowing land to become hazardous, unsanitary, or ecologically destructive;
	•	maintaining property solely as a financial instrument without meaningful use;
	•	using shell entities or layered ownership to evade accountability.

Such conduct is contrary to the common good and subject to sanction.

(d) Enforcement Authority
Stewardship shall be enforced through a mixed model:
	•	local authorities shall conduct inspections, issue notices of violation, and document conditions;
	•	state authorities shall oversee enforcement standards, ensure uniformity, and prevent abuse or favoritism;
	•	all compulsory actions shall be subject to judicial review.

No land may be seized, reassigned, or repurposed without due process of law. Courts shall evaluate substance over form and material outcomes over nominal compliance.

(e) Notice and Opportunity to Cure
Before any compulsory action is taken, the owner shall receive:
	•	written notice of specific violations;
	•	a reasonable opportunity to cure or remediate;
	•	access to an impartial hearing;
	•	the right to present evidence and contest findings.

Emergency action may be taken only where immediate danger to life, health, or the environment exists, and must be reviewed by a court without delay.

(f) Remedies
Upon judicial finding of sustained stewardship violation, remedies may include:
	•	fines proportionate to harm and duration;
	•	mandatory remediation or use requirements;
	•	temporary receivership;
	•	transfer to homesteading, public trust, or community use as defined by law;
	•	forfeiture only in cases of willful, repeated, and egregious violation.

Receivership, temporary stewardship, compulsory leasing, or provisional homesteading shall not convey title or permanent ownership. Transfer or forfeiture of title may occur only upon a judicial finding of willful, repeated, and egregious violation of stewardship duties, following notice, opportunity to cure, proportional review, and written findings of fact and law.
Standing shall be construed broadly to include affected landholders, neighboring communities, downstream users, and civic organizations.
Punishment shall be corrective first, punitive only when correction is refused.

(g) Protection Against Abuse
Stewardship laws shall not be used to:
	•	dispossess productive smallholders;
	•	target owners based on political, ideological, or cultural grounds;
	•	enable corruption, favoritism, or retaliatory enforcement;
	•	concentrate land ownership in the State or corporate monopolies.

All enforcement actions must be transparent, reviewable, and grounded in demonstrable harm.
(h) Public Grazing and Commons Use.
The people retain the right to graze livestock and working animals on public lands traditionally or reasonably suitable for such use, provided such grazing is conducted in a non-destructive, non-hazardous, and ecologically responsible manner.

Such use shall not be conditioned upon discretionary permits, exclusive leases, or administrative approval regimes that function as barriers to access, favor large or centralized operators, or suppress subsistence, small-scale, or traditional use.

The government bears the burden of demonstrating, by clear and site-specific evidence, that a particular grazing practice, as conducted, causes material harm to public safety or the environment that cannot be mitigated by reasonable, narrowly tailored conditions.

Grazing rights shall not be extinguished, suspended, or reduced by generalized policy, speculative modeling, or economic preference, and shall be construed as a lawful use of the public commons consistent with stewardship obligations.
(i) Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to ensure that land serves life, family, production, and continuity—not speculation, decay, or absentee domination.

As Scripture teaches: “Moreover, it is required in stewards that one be found faithful.”

Section 2. Homesteading Rights

(a) Purpose
The purpose of homesteading is to restore productive use of neglected land, expand access to housing and agriculture, strengthen families, and prevent permanent hoarding or decay. Homesteading is a civic instrument of renewal, not a loophole for speculation or seizure.

(b) Eligibility
Only Civic Citizens of the Republic may initiate a homesteading claim. “Civic Citizen” has the meaning set forth in Article III. Legal residents may participate only as dependents, partners, or laborers under a qualified Civic Citizen.

No corporation, trust, shell entity, or foreign-controlled body may initiate a homesteading claim.

(c) Eligible Land
Land eligible for homesteading shall be limited to parcels that meet all of the following conditions:
	•	demonstrably unused, abandoned, or neglected for a continuous period defined by law;
	•	not actively farmed, inhabited, or maintained in good faith;
	•	not subject to active remediation or lawful development;
	•	not held for essential public, military, ecological, or cultural purposes;
	•	not the primary residence of any lawful owner.

Farmland, housing stock, and mixed-use land may qualify only upon judicial certification of abandonment or non-productive hoarding.

(d) Petition and Review
Homesteading shall proceed only by formal petition filed with the appropriate local authority and reviewed by a Stewardship Court or designated judicial body.

(e) Provisional Stewardship Period
If approved, the petitioner shall be granted provisional stewardship for a fixed term not less than three years.

(f) Final Vesting
Upon successful completion of the provisional period and certification by the Stewardship Court, title shall vest fully in the homesteader, subject to continuing stewardship obligations.

(g) Civic Contribution
Responsible agricultural labor, soil stewardship, and family-scale food production may qualify as equivalent public service toward earning Civic Citizenship, subject to objective verification and the standards of Article III and Article XVIII.

Section 3. Anti-Speculative Ownership
(a) Purpose
The purpose of this Section is to prevent land and housing from being treated as purely speculative instruments divorced from use, stewardship, and human settlement.

(b) Definition of Speculative Ownership
Speculative ownership shall be defined as the acquisition or retention of land or housing primarily for price manipulation, artificial scarcity, passive appreciation without productive use, or rent extraction absent maintenance or improvement.

(c) Ownership Transparency
All land ownership shall be transparent. Beneficial ownership must be publicly disclosed. Anonymous or nominee ownership is prohibited. Failure to disclose constitutes grounds for forfeiture.
Any attempt to circumvent these limits through proxies, trusts, shell companies, or pretextual coercion (as defined in Article 0) is void ab initio.
(d) Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to ensure that land serves families, workers, farmers, and communities before financiers and absentee interests.

Section 4. Agricultural Protection

(a) Purpose
Agriculture is a matter of national survival, not merely commerce. The Republic affirms that food security and domestic agricultural independence are essential to sovereignty.

(b) Preservation of Farmland
Farmland shall be preserved primarily for food production. Conversion to non-agricultural use shall be restricted and subject to transparent approval.

(c) Foreign Ownership
Foreign governments, foreign-controlled entities, and large corporations (as defined in Article XVII) shall be strictly limited in their ownership or control of agricultural land, water rights, and primary natural resources.
Such ownership or control shall be:
1. capped at a maximum percentage of total arable land per entity, as determined by statute;
2. subject to revocation if it results in land-hoarding, monoculture that degrades soil health, environmental harm, suppression of family farming, or demographic engineering (cross-reference Article 0 definitions of Demographic Engineering and Corporation);
3. prohibited outright for entities whose beneficial ownership includes substantial foreign state or adversarial interests.
Any attempt to circumvent these limits through proxies, trusts, shell companies, or pretextual coercion (as defined in Article 0) is void ab initio.
(d) Interpretation
This Section shall be interpreted to preserve farming as a living vocation, not a financial abstraction.

Section 5. Food Integrity and Ecological Protection

(a) Prohibition of Food Cartels
Food cartels, price-fixing, and supply manipulation are prohibited.

(b) Prohibition of Poisonous Practices
It is unlawful to introduce substances into soil, air, or water that degrade long-term fertility or habitability.

(c) Evidentiary Standard
No plant or substance may be prohibited without clear and convincing scientific evidence of substantial harm, subject to transparent public review, adversarial testing, and periodic renewal. Criminal penalties arising from such prohibitions shall require proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

(d) Third-Tier Crimes
Knowingly poisoning land, water, air, or food systems constitutes a third-tier crime as defined in Article VII.

Section 6. Ecological Responsibility

(a) Duty of Care
All persons and entities have a duty to avoid reckless or irreversible ecological harm.

(b) Scientific Standard
Environmental restrictions shall be based on reproducible scientific evidence and periodic review.
(c) Scientific Uncertainty
Where scientific uncertainty exists, the presumption shall favor liberty, property rights, and productive use unless clear and convincing evidence demonstrates imminent and specific harm.
(d) Interpretation
Environmental protection shall serve life and stewardship, not ideology or control.

Section 7. Native and Ancestral Stewardship

(a) Purpose
The Republic recognizes Indigenous and ancestral ties to land while maintaining one Constitution and one rule of law.

(b) Status
Indigenous communities are local civic entities subject to this Constitution.

(c) Interpretation
Heritage shall be preserved without fragmenting sovereignty.

Section 8. Religious and Communal Stewardship of Land

(a) Equal Application of Law
Religious and communal land holdings are subject to the same law and stewardship obligations as all others.

(b) Prohibited Uses
Land may not be used under religious pretext to conceal abuse, trafficking, or coercion.

(c) Interpretation
Faith does not excuse atrocity.

Section 9. Voluntary Communities and Cooperative Living

(a) Right of Formation
Voluntary communities may form, subject to the Constitution and laws of the Republic.

(b) Prohibition of Coercion
No community may restrict lawful exit or impose coercion.

(c) Interpretation
Community is a liberty, not a license.

Section 10. Housing Stability Mandate

(a) Purpose
Habitable housing shall not be artificially withheld from use amid demonstrable need.

(b) Due Process
No housing may be seized or repurposed without notice, opportunity to cure, judicial findings, and proportional remedy.

(c) Interpretation
Housing shall serve human dignity and continuity.
Section 11. Anti-Predatory Recycling and Material Reuse

(a) Material Stewardship Principle
All physical goods, machinery, electronics, and industrial artifacts embody labor, knowledge, and public value. Destruction of functional or repairable goods for market control, profit maximization, or artificial scarcity is a form of economic and environmental harm.

⸻

(b) Reuse Before Recycle

No recycler, manufacturer, disposal contractor, or waste intermediary may shred, export, or materially destroy any functional or repairable device, tool, or machine unless:
	1.	it has been offered for reuse, repair, or resale;
	2.	it has been offered to public institutions, schools, or charitable technology programs; and
	3.	it has been offered to preservation, repair, or historical organizations.

Only goods that are unsafe, irreparably damaged, or beyond reasonable economic repair may be processed for raw material recovery.

⸻

(c) Prohibition on Market-Suppressive Destruction

Destruction of usable goods for the purpose of:

• eliminating secondary markets;
• forcing consumer repurchase;
• maintaining vendor lock-in;
• suppressing competition;
• or controlling access to technology

is prohibited and constitutes economic sabotage and environmental fraud.

⸻

(d) Electronics, Machinery, and Digital Infrastructure

All electronic, computing, networking, industrial, and scientific equipment is subject to this Section.

This includes computers, servers, phones, routers, vehicles, medical devices, laboratory instruments, and manufacturing systems.

⸻

(e) Enforcement and Integration

Violations are enforceable by:

• environmental authorities;
• inspectors general;
• the Digital Commons Enforcement Authority;
• and any citizen with standing.

Remedies include seizure, redistribution, public auction, restitution, loss of contracts, and criminal penalties where willful.
