Article XVI-B — Popular Recall, Removal, and Institutional Dissolution

Section 1 — Affirmation of Popular Authority

The People retain the sovereign authority to recall, remove, expel, or otherwise terminate the service of any public official, officer, or appointee, and to dissolve governmental agencies or administrative bodies that are corrupt, hostile to constitutional order, or persistently fail in their lawful duties.

This authority is fundamental and shall not be construed narrowly.

⸻

Section 2 — Scope Limitation and Targeting Requirement

The exercise of popular recall, expulsion, or dissolution under this Constitution shall be specific and targeted.

No single popular petition, vote, or action may:
	•	dissolve an entire constitutional branch of government in aggregate;
	•	vacate all offices within a branch simultaneously; or
	•	extinguish a constitutionally required governmental function.

Popular remedies shall operate against persons, offices, agencies, or discrete institutional components, not against constitutional structures as a whole.

⸻

Section 3 — Personnel Removal Distinguished from Functional Abolition

The removal of officials, officers, or employees shall not be construed as the abolition of the constitutional powers or duties attached to their offices.

Where an office or agency is dissolved by popular action:
	•	the function it performed shall remain constitutionally required unless expressly eliminated by constitutional amendment;
	•	the temporary absence of an office shall not excuse nonperformance of constitutional duties.

⸻

Section 4 — Mandatory Reconstitution of Essential Functions

Upon the dissolution or vacancy of an agency, department, or office charged with executing a constitutional or statutory function:
	1.	The Executive shall be affirmatively obligated to:
	•	reconstitute the function in a lawful form;
	•	appoint new leadership and personnel, as required;
	•	restore operational capacity without undue delay.
	2.	Reconstitution may include:
	•	restructuring or renaming the agency;
	•	replacement of personnel in whole or in part;
	•	alteration of internal organization;
but shall not include permanent abdication of the function.

Failure to reconstitute a required function constitutes a constitutional violation.

⸻

Section 5 — Legislative and Judicial Symmetry

Popular recall and removal powers shall apply with equal force to:
	•	executive officers;
	•	individual legislators;
	•	legislative chambers (one chamber at a time);
	•	individual judicial officers, including a chief justice.

The judiciary and legislature as institutions shall not be dissolved in their entirety by a single popular act.

⸻

Section 6 — Anti-Abuse and Continuity Safeguard

All exercises of popular recall or dissolution shall:
	•	preserve constitutional continuity;
	•	avoid the creation of institutional vacuums;
	•	be executed in a manner consistent with public order and lawful transition.

The People’s sovereign authority to correct government abuse shall not be construed to authorize constitutional self-destruction.

⸻

Section 7 — Construction and Precedence

This Article governs the scope and effect of popular recall, expulsion, and institutional dissolution throughout this Constitution.

In the event of conflict or ambiguity, this Article shall control.
