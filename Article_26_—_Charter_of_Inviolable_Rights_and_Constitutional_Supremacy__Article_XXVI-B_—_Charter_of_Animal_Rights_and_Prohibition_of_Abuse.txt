Article XXVI-B — Charter of Animal Rights and Prohibition of Abuse

⸻

Charge
The purpose of this Article is to recognize animals as sentient beings entitled to protection from cruelty, exploitation, and unnecessary suffering, while preserving the lawful and humane use of animals for food, husbandry, work, conservation, and companionship.

This Article establishes enforceable constitutional duties of humane treatment, prohibits exploitative or abusive conduct, and provides standards for enforcement that are evidence-based, narrowly tailored, and consistent with the rights secured by Article XXVI-A.

⸻
1. Recognition of Animal Dignity

Animals are sentient beings capable of suffering and shall not be treated as mere instruments, disposable property, or objects of exploitation.

The Republic recognizes a duty of humane stewardship toward all animals under human control or influence.

⸻

2. Absolute Prohibition of Zoöphilic Acts

All zoöphilic activity—defined as any sexual act, contact, exploitation, or coercive interaction between a human and a non-human animal—is constitutionally prohibited.

Consent shall never be presumed, implied, or asserted on behalf of an animal.

Participation in such acts constitutes a Tier-3 crime.

⸻

3. Prohibition of Cruelty, Torture, and Neglect

No person shall intentionally or recklessly:
	•	torture, mutilate, or cruelly mistreat an animal;
	•	subject an animal to prolonged or unnecessary suffering;
	•	deprive an animal of food, water, shelter, or humane conditions necessary for life and health;
	•	abandon an animal under circumstances likely to cause suffering or death.

Acts of cruelty or severe neglect constitute Tier-3 crimes.

⸻

4. Duty of Care

Any person who keeps, controls, transports, breeds, sells, or otherwise assumes responsibility for an animal owes a non-delegable duty of care.

Cultural custom, claimed necessity, or convenience shall not excuse cruelty.

Economic hardship alone shall not constitute criminal neglect.

⸻

4-A. Reasonable Access and Economic Hardship

Failure to obtain veterinary care shall not constitute cruelty or neglect where:
	1.	the person acted in good faith;
	2.	the cost of care was reasonably beyond the person’s means; and
	3.	the person did not willfully ignore or exacerbate the animal’s suffering.

Where reasonable, accessible, and humane alternatives exist—including charitable care, community assistance, or surrender without penalty—failure to pursue such alternatives may constitute neglect.

The burden rests on the state to demonstrate willful or reckless disregard, not mere inability.

⸻

5. Aggravating Factors

Aggravating circumstances include:
	•	repeated or patterned abuse;
	•	abuse involving multiple animals;
	•	abuse committed for gratification, profit, coercion, or spectacle;
	•	abuse recorded, distributed, or encouraged;
	•	abuse committed by persons in positions of trust or authority.

Aggravated offenses warrant enhanced penalties and permanent disqualification from animal custody.

⸻

6. Enforcement, Standing, and Safeguards

The state has an affirmative duty to investigate credible allegations of animal abuse.

Standing to report shall be broad, but enforcement actions shall require credible evidence beyond anonymous or malicious reporting.

Inspections of subsistence or small-scale operations shall require probable cause or specific, credible complaint.

Knowingly false or weaponized reports constitute abuse of process.

The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to investigate whether regulatory schemes or enforcement actions are being used to suppress subsistence, decentralization, or food autonomy.

⸻

6-A. Public Duty of Humane Access

The state shall not impose criminal liability for animal neglect without ensuring the availability of reasonable, humane avenues to prevent suffering, including:
	•	low-cost or subsidized veterinary care;
	•	emergency treatment assistance;
	•	humane surrender or transfer without punitive consequence;
	•	public or charitable animal welfare services.

Failure to provide such avenues bars prosecution for neglect absent clear evidence of intentional cruelty.

⸻

7. Relationship to Lawful Use

Nothing in this Article prohibits:
	•	humane husbandry and slaughter;
	•	lawful hunting or fishing under humane standards;
	•	veterinary practice;
	•	pest control or culling necessary for herd health or ecological balance;
	•	euthanasia performed to prevent suffering.

Such practices shall not be used as pretext for abuse.

⸻

8. Construction and Lock

This Article shall be construed strictly against cruelty and exploitation, and liberally in favor of animal protection without infringing the rights secured by Article XXVI-A.

The prohibitions herein are structural and non-derogable, and may not be suspended by emergency, custom, or administrative convenience.
