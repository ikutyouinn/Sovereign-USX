Article VI-G — Jury Doctrine

Section 1. Constitutional Status of the Jury

The jury is a constitutional institution of the Republic and a direct instrument of popular sovereignty in the administration of justice.

In criminal cases, the jury stands as an independent check upon the State, empowered to protect liberty against unjust accusation, prosecution, or law.

⸻

Section 2. Authority Over Law and Fact

In criminal cases, the jury possesses the authority to judge both the facts and the application of the law to those facts.

No court shall instruct a jury that it is bound to convict upon a particular interpretation of the law.

No verdict of acquittal shall be set aside, reviewed, or questioned on the ground that the jury disagreed with the law, its application, or its justice.

⸻

Section 3. Prohibition on Coercion and Punishment

No juror shall be punished, sanctioned, investigated, fined, imprisoned, or otherwise penalized for:
	1.	the verdict rendered;
	2.	the reasoning employed in reaching a verdict;
	3.	refusal to convict in a criminal case.

Inquiry into jury deliberations for the purpose of punishing jurors or impeaching a verdict is prohibited.

⸻

Section 4. Limits on Judicial Control

Judges shall not:
	1.	direct a verdict of guilty;
	2.	override or vacate a verdict of acquittal;
	3.	coerce unanimity through threats, sanctions, or improper instructions;
	4.	impose instructions designed to nullify the jury’s constitutional authority.

Judicial instructions shall explain the law but shall not compel a particular outcome.

⸻

Section 5. Hung Juries and Mistrials

Where a jury cannot reach unanimity in a criminal case, the court may declare a mistrial.

No adverse inference shall be drawn against the accused from a hung jury.

Repeated prosecutions following mistrial shall be subject to judicial scrutiny to prevent harassment or coercive retrial.

⸻

Section 6. Civil Juries

In civil cases, the jury shall determine questions of fact.

No court shall override a civil jury’s factual findings except where constitutionally authorized.

The Legislature may regulate civil jury practice by law, provided that such regulation does not impair the essential function of the jury as a finder of fact.

⸻

Section 7. Jury Independence and Composition

Juries shall be drawn from the People and shall represent a fair cross-section of the community.

No jury shall be selected, excluded, or shaped to secure a particular verdict.

Jurors shall be free from intimidation, surveillance, or retaliation by the State or private parties.

⸻

Section 8. Relationship to Artificial Intelligence

No artificial intelligence, algorithmic system, or automated process shall be used to:
	1.	influence jury deliberations;
	2.	assess juror credibility or behavior;
	3.	recommend or predict jury outcomes;
	4.	substitute for jury judgment.

Any verdict influenced by prohibited use of artificial systems is void.

⸻

Section 9. Non-Waiver of Structural Protection

The jury’s constitutional role shall not be diminished by statute, procedure, efficiency concerns, or administrative convenience.

Any law, rule, or practice inconsistent with this Subarticle is void.

⸻

Section 10. Interpretation

This Subarticle shall be interpreted liberally in favor of jury independence, acquittal authority, and protection of the accused.

Ambiguities shall be resolved to preserve the jury as a living institution of popular judgment rather than a mere procedural formality.

⸻

[LOCK DESIGNATION]

The following principles of this Subarticle are designated for lock protection and shall not be abridged by amendment except by explicit constitutional revision:
	1.	jury authority over law and fact in criminal cases;
	2.	prohibition on punishment or coercion of jurors;
	3.	finality of acquittals;
	4.	independence of jury deliberations.
