Article I — Principles of the Republic

Charge
This open-source republican Constitution is founded upon the ideals of classical liberalism, including the protection of natural rights such as freedom of speech and the right to redress grievances in government; equality under the law, including due process and the rejection of caste and elitism; and the right to expect safety and stability from government, including free and fair elections and a fair economic system.
Natural rights are granted by Nature’s God. This Republic shall defend those rights and hold them above legislative, religious, and political whims.
This Constitution establishes a Republic of ordered liberty devoted to fairness, openness, and accountability, with a mission to promote the evolution of technology and an ever-rising standard of living for its citizens and for mankind as a whole.
Authority within this system is neither inherited, granted at birth, purchased, nor taken by force. Authority is earned through knowledge of the Republic’s systems, achievement, and service to the Republic.
No institution, office, or group within the Republic may override the supremacy of this Constitution, subvert the sovereignty of the People, or abrogate any inviolable rights.
This Article sets forth the foundational kernel of the Republic: the nature of sovereignty, the limits of power, the distinction between civil and political status, and the duties of stewardship and vigilance that bind all participants and all who wield power to serve the well-being of the Republic and the People within.

Legal Text

Section 1. Nature of the Republic

The Republic is a constitutional, rights-bounded system of ordered liberty grounded in justice, responsibility, and stewardship.

Government exists solely to:
(a) recognize, protect, and secure the natural and civil rights of the People;
(b) uphold equal justice under law;
(c) provide public goods that cannot be effectively supplied by individuals or markets; and
(d) preserve the constitutional order.

Ordered liberty means liberty exercised under law, bounded by the equal rights of others, and constrained by duties of citizenship and public trust. It is not a license for coercion or arbitrarily wielding power.

No authority may redefine “justice,” “evidence,” “morality,” or “public good” to negate, diminish, or subordinate the rights secured by this Constitution.

Section 2. Supremacy of the Constitution

This Constitution is the supreme law of the Republic and binds all branches, officers, agencies, courts, subdivisions, instrumentalities, and all persons acting under color of law within the Republic.

Any statute, treaty, decree, regulation, ordinance, executive action, judicial doctrine, or administrative practice inconsistent with this Constitution is void and without legal force.

No emergency, necessity, international obligation, or assertion of immunity shall be invoked to justify noncompliance with this Constitution. This Constitution grants no excuse for dereliction of any duty, limitation, or prohibition set forth herein.

All public officials owe primary allegiance to this Constitution and are personally accountable for acts taken, directly or indirectly, in violation of it, including acts taken in reliance upon agency guidance, contractor direction, expert advice, custom, policy, or superior orders.

Section 3. Separation of Powers

The Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches are separate, coequal, and bound by this Constitution.

Each branch shall exercise only the powers expressly granted to it, and no branch may exercise, delegate, assume, or conceal the powers of another.

Coequality means no branch is subordinate to another in constitutional authority, but all are subordinate to the Constitution and the People.

No branch may evade accountability through:
• delegation to unaccountable bodies,
• reclassification of powers,
• emergency doctrine,
• judicial or administrative invention, or
• procedural obstruction.

All branches remain continuously accountable to the People and to constitutional review.

Section 4. Moral and Civilizational Foundation

The Republic affirms that liberty cannot be sustained without respect for human dignity, historical continuity, and ethical restraint.

This Constitution draws upon the accumulated moral, legal, and philosophical traditions of human civilization, including principles of justice, mercy, truth, accountability, and stewardship.

Moral principles may guide law, but the State shall impose no moral, religious, cultural, or ideological doctrine as a condition of legal status, civil rights, or political participation.

No religion, creed, philosophy, or belief system shall be established, endorsed, or enforced by government, and government shall not coerce belief or conscience.

This system acknowledges that many of the Republic’s inherited moral foundations were shaped by religious traditions, including those associated with Christian and Jewish ancestors. This Constitution imposes no requirement of faith. It recognizes the historical influence of religious moral thought on the development of classical liberalism and affirms that a higher moral order exists beyond the State, so that human dignity and natural rights cannot be overridden or overwritten by government.

No provision of this Section authorizes:
(a) establishment of religion;
(b) preference for one faith, culture, or worldview over another;
(c) any civil hierarchy based on belief;
(d) coercion of conscience, identity, or worship.

Courts shall construe this Section to preserve moral grounding while prohibiting theocracy, ideological enforcement, and cultural supremacy.

(1) Civil Standing.
All lawful residents as defined by Article 0 possess full and equal civil standing under this Constitution.

(2) Included Persons.
Lawful residents include, at minimum:
(a) persons born within the territory of the Republic to at least one lawful resident;
(b) persons born abroad to a qualifying parent, as defined in Article III, and recognized as lawful residents for purposes of entry and documentation; and
(c) all persons lawfully admitted for permanent residence.

(3) Equal Protection and Civil Rights.
All lawful residents retain the full and equal protection of this Constitution and all rights enumerated in the Charter of Inviolable Rights, including but not limited to freedom of speech, religion, conscience, movement, enterprise, property, due process, and access to the courts.
(cross-reference Article II; Article 0; Article III)

(4) Civil Participation.
Lawful residents may participate fully in civil society, culture, education, labor, association, and public discourse.

(5) Political Authority Reserved to Civic Citizens.
Political authority—including the right to vote, hold public office, or exercise control over government institutions—shall be exercised only by Civic Citizens who have satisfied the requirements of Article III.

(6) No Caste.
Civic status is a qualification for governance, not a classification of human worth. No civil right, legal protection, or human dignity shall depend upon civic status.

(7) No Limbo Status; No Administrative Evasion.
No lawful resident shall be deprived of civil rights, property, liberty, legal standing, identity documentation sufficient to prove lawful status, or access to the courts on the basis of non-civic status. Civil rights attach upon lawful residence, not upon possession of documents. No authority may redefine, narrow, expand, delay, or condition classifications of lawful residence or civic status to evade constitutional protections. Any denial, suspension, or revocation of lawful resident status shall require due process, written findings, and prompt judicial review as provided by Article II.

Section 6. Rights of Unlawful Entrants

Persons who enter or reside unlawfully retain the right to:
(a) due process of law;
(b) freedom from violence, coercion, and abuse;
(c) humane treatment; and
(d) Good Samaritan aid necessary to preserve life and dignity.

Unlawful entrants shall not possess political rights, shall not be counted for purposes of representation or apportionment, and shall not acquire lawful status or civic standing through executive, administrative, or political discretion alone.

Any grant, denial, or regularization of status shall occur only through procedures established by law, subject to Constitutional Judicial Commission and judicial review and consistent with this Constitution.

Section 7. Mechanisms of Rectification

A lawful and limited pathway of rectification may be established by law for:
(a) persons brought into the Republic as minors through no fault of their own; or
(b) persons who demonstrate exceptional, verifiable contributions to the public welfare, national security, or civic life of the Republic.

Rectification shall be:
(a) administered through individualized determinations by independent, non-partisan bodies;
(b) governed by objective, transparent, and measurable criteria;
(c) subject to judicial review; and
(d) limited in scale so as not to permit demographic engineering, political manipulation, or mass regularization.

No individual, class, or group shall obtain lawful status, residency, or civic standing through discretionary amnesty, executive action, or political bargaining.

Section 8. Condemnation of Corruption and Oathbreaking

Oathbreaking, corruption, fraud, and abuse of public office constitute grave offenses against the Republic and the People.

Public office is a fiduciary trust. Every officer owes a duty of loyalty, honesty, and lawful service to the Constitution and to the People.

Any official who:
(a) knowingly violates the Constitution;
(b) uses office for private gain;
(c) abuses authority;
(d) betrays public trust; or
(e) participates in institutional capture
shall be subject to removal, disqualification, civil liability, and criminal prosecution as provided by law.

No oath, immunity, rank, or position shall shield any person from accountability for betrayal of public trust.

Section 9. Duty of Stewardship

All citizens and all holders of public office owe a constitutional duty of stewardship over land, resources, institutions, and the public trust, as defined in Article 0.

Holders of public office and any person acting under color of law additionally owe public stewardship as defined in Article 0.

Neglect, waste, looting, short-term exploitation, or predatory conduct that materially weakens the Republic, degrades its resources, or undermines its institutions constitutes a breach of constitutional duty.

Breach of stewardship is enforceable through civil liability, forfeiture, disqualification from office, and criminal sanction as provided by law.

(cross-reference Articles IX; XXXVII)

Section 10. Eternal Vigilance

(a) Principle

Liberty and constitutional integrity require continuous vigilance. Tyranny, corruption, and decay must be actively opposed and shall not be permitted to arise through silence, fear, or institutional drift.

(b) Right

The People retain the right to peaceably oppose, expose, criticize, investigate, and lawfully resist:
• constitutional violations;
• corruption;
• unlawful authority; and
• abuse of public power.

(c) Protection

No person shall be punished, harassed, censored, surveilled, deprived of rights, or subjected to retaliation for lawful civic protest, whistleblowing, journalism, oversight, or public criticism undertaken in defense of constitutional order.

(d) Civic Duty

All citizens, and especially all holders of public office, have a duty to defend this Constitution, report violations, refuse unlawful orders, and oppose institutional capture, even when such defense is unpopular or dangerous.

Section 11. Lock Designation

Civic vigilance, lawful oversight, and informed engagement by the People are essential to the health and survival of the Republic.

The core principles of this Article — including:
• ordered liberty;
• moral and civilizational grounding;
• the supremacy of the Constitution;
• separation of powers;
• the duty of stewardship; and
• the distinction between Civic and non-civic citizens —
are structural to this Constitution and shall not be repealed, suspended, diluted, or reinterpreted to undermine liberty, accountability, or popular sovereignty.

These principles may be amended only through the lock-protected procedures of Article XV and only in a manner that preserves, and does not diminish, their substantive force.

No statute, regulation, executive action, treaty, or judicial doctrine may evade or weaken this Lock.
