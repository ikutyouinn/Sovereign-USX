Article XXXVI — Transition, Accession, and Discontinuity of Power

(Authoritative Integrated Text — Section-by-Section Print)

Charge

No lawful Republic may arise from confusion, nor endure through ambiguity.

The moment of transition—whether at founding, reunification, annexation, or accession—is the hour of greatest danger. Power clings to habit. Authority masquerades as continuity. Institutions resist accountability by invoking tradition, emergency, or expertise.

This Article exists to ensure that all authority within the Republic arises only from this Constitution, that no power survives by inertia or custom, and that transitions of sovereignty occur openly, lawfully, and without shadow rule.

The purpose of transition is not preservation of privilege, but the lawful reconstitution of authority under consent, clarity, and accountability.

Section 1. Constitutional Supremacy at Inception

Upon ratification of this Constitution, or upon lawful accession of any territory, state, or polity:

a. this Constitution shall take immediate and supreme effect;
b. all prior constitutional, statutory, executive, customary, or prerogative authorities inconsistent with it are hereby extinguished;
c. no office, power, or discretion shall survive by tradition, convention, precedent, or implied necessity.

Authority exists only where expressly conferred by this Constitution or by laws enacted pursuant to it.

Section 2. Discontinuity of Prior Executive Authority

Upon transition:

a. all executive powers not expressly reconstituted by this Constitution are void;
b. no individual may exercise authority by virtue of prior title, office, or role;
c. no interim, caretaker, emergency, or advisory authority may exercise binding power absent express constitutional or legislative authorization.

Former heads of state, heads of government, ministers, prime ministers, or equivalent officials shall possess no authority beyond that granted to any other citizen or legislator.

Section 3. Temporary Continuity of Essential Services

To prevent harm to life, safety, or basic civil order:

a. essential services may continue to operate temporarily under transitional authority;
b. such authority shall be strictly limited to operational continuity;
c. no new policy, rulemaking, enforcement expansion, or discretionary power may be exercised absent lawful delegation.

Essential services shall be defined by statute prior to transition, with judicial review available for any expansion.

Transitional operational authority shall be exercised only by persons or bodies designated by law enacted pursuant to this Constitution.

All transitional authorities shall sunset automatically within a defined period not to exceed eighteen (18) months unless earlier replaced or reauthorized by law.

 Section 3A. Sunset of Legacy Administrative Bodies

All administrative bodies, agencies, departments, commissions, or instrumentalities exercising authority by custom, implication, historical practice, executive continuity, or pre-constitutional delegation shall be deemed provisional upon ratification of this Constitution.

Such bodies shall sunset automatically within a period not to exceed five (5) years from ratification unless expressly reauthorized by statute enacted pursuant to this Constitution and consistent with Article XXI.

No claim of operational necessity, expertise, continuity, emergency, funding obligation, or public reliance shall extend or preserve authority beyond this sunset period absent such reauthorization.

Acts taken by any body after expiration of its authority shall be void and shall constitute usurpation of public authority under Article VII.


Section 4. Prohibition of Shadow Governance

During transition and thereafter:

a. no advisory body, coordination council, emergency committee, or task force may exercise binding authority;
b. no power may be exercised through informal guidance, expectation, pressure, or custom;
c. no official may issue directives absent lawful authority and recorded accountability.

No foreign government, institution, or agent may exercise advisory, financial, security, or administrative influence over transitional authority absent express constitutional or legislative authorization.

Any attempt to govern through ambiguity, urgency, or extralegal coordination shall constitute usurpation of authority under Article VII.

Section 5. Oath, Reconstitution, and Vetting of Officials

All persons exercising public authority after transition must:

a. swear a new oath to this Constitution;
b. acknowledge the nullification of prior prerogative authority;
c. accept personal liability for acts taken without lawful authorization.

Failure to re-oath or continued assertion of former authority shall result in immediate removal and disqualification.

Section 6. Accession of States, Polities, and Nations

Any territory, state, or nation acceding to the Republic may:

a. retain cultural, ceremonial, or symbolic institutions;
b. preserve local legal traditions consistent with constitutional supremacy;
c. maintain non-executive hereditary or customary offices.

No ceremonial or symbolic office shall:

a. exercise executive, legislative, or judicial power;
b. confer civic citizenship by title alone;
c. override elected or constitutional authority.

All persons, regardless of title, are subject to equal law and civic obligation.

Any vote, referendum, or formal expression of consent regarding accession, independence, or territorial status under this Article shall be conducted solely by an electorate meeting the standards of Civic Citizenship defined in Article III, or by a transitional electorate meeting equivalent civic qualifications as established by law and subject to judicial review.

Section 7. Treatment of Ceremonial Heads of State

Where an acceding state retains a ceremonial monarch, crown, or equivalent:

a. such office shall be purely symbolic;
b. no authority shall attach by lineage or tradition;
c. the officeholder shall possess no immunity beyond personal security protections granted by law.

Personal security protections for ceremonial figures shall be limited to reasonable measures necessary for physical safety, without conferring immunity, privilege, or political influence.

Ceremonial figures shall not substitute for governors, executives, or constitutional officers.

Section 8. Judicial and Legislative Oversight During Transition

All transitional actions are subject to:

a. judicial review without deference;
b. legislative inquiry and recorded oversight;
c. citizen standing for challenge of unlawful authority.

Judicial review shall be available within thirty (30) days of filing upon citizen challenge of any transitional action.

Courts shall construe this Article strictly against implied power and broadly against institutional inertia.

Section 9. Criminalization of Usurpation

Any person who knowingly:

a. exercises authority not granted by this Constitution;
b. issues directives under color of extinguished office;
c. obstructs lawful transition through deception, delay, or sabotage;
d. coordinates extrajudicial governance;

shall be guilty of usurpation of public authority and subject to criminal penalty, removal, and permanent disqualification.

Good-faith transitional errors not involving malice or personal gain may be subject to administrative sanction rather than criminal penalty, as provided by law.

Section 10. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to:

a. extinguish power by habit;
b. prevent executive resurrection by custom;
c. deny legitimacy to shadow governance;
d. favor clarity over continuity;
e. ensure that no Republic is born half-free.

Section 11. Irrevocability of Accession and Suppression of Secession

Upon lawful accession of any territory, state, polity, or nation to the Republic:

a. accession shall be permanent and irrevocable absent constitutional amendment enacted pursuant to this Constitution;
b. no region, subdivision, faction, institution, or association within the acceded territory possesses any right to secede, partition, reclaim prior sovereignty, or reconstitute former governments;
c. all prior claims of sovereignty, independence, or right of withdrawal are extinguished upon accession.

Any attempt, whether by force, coercion, declaration, referendum, or coordinated action, to:

a. establish a breakaway state or government;
b. reclaim authority under a former constitutional or monarchical system;
c. partition territory from the Republic;
d. invite or accept foreign recognition or protection for such purposes;

shall constitute rebellion against the Republic.

The Republic shall possess both the right and the duty to suppress such rebellion by all necessary and proportionate means, including the use of force, to preserve territorial integrity, constitutional order, and the equal protection of the People.

Suppression shall be proportionate, subject to due process, and shall not include mass detention absent individualized probable cause.

No claim of tradition, self-determination, cultural grievance, historic sovereignty, or political dissatisfaction shall excuse or legitimize acts of secession or territorial dismemberment once accession has lawfully occurred.

Section 12. Protection of Lawful Dissent

Nothing in this Article shall be construed to prohibit:

a. lawful political opposition;
b. advocacy for constitutional amendment;
c. cultural autonomy consistent with constitutional supremacy;
d. peaceful expression of dissent within the framework of this Constitution.

The prohibition herein applies solely to attempts to dissolve, fragment, or withdraw territory from the Republic outside constitutional process.
