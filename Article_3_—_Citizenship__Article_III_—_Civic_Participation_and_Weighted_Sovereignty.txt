Article III — Civic Participation and Weighted Sovereignty

Charge

Political sovereignty is a privilege scaled by demonstrated responsibility to the Republic.
All lawful residents retain equal civil rights and human dignity.
Civic Standing (1× base plus earned weights) may be recognized only among Civic Citizens. No Civic Standing exists for non-civic residents, who possess no franchise unless and until Civic Citizenship is earned under this Article.
This Article defines the conditions under which political authority, suffrage, and eligibility for public office are granted within the Republic. It establishes Civic Citizenship as a constitutional office of trust, earned through lawful service, competence, and allegiance to the constitutional order, and it distinguishes political authority from personhood, dignity, and civil rights.
The purpose is to ensure that those who govern have demonstrated sacrifice, responsibility, and accountability to the People, while guaranteeing equal civil rights and human dignity to all lawful residents.

Section 1. Definitions, Age of Majority, and Service Eligibility

(a) Age of Adulthood.
The age of adulthood shall be twenty-one (21).

(b) Minimum Age to Begin Service.
No qualifying service toward Civic Citizenship or Civic Standing may begin before eighteen (18) years of age.

(c) Practical Minimum Age for Completion.
Because qualifying service may not begin before eighteen (18), and the shortest qualifying term is two (2) years, completion before twenty-one (21) shall be rare or impracticable except where specifically authorized by law without undermining the purpose of this Article.

(d) Classes of Persons.
This Constitution recognizes: lawful residents, non-civic residents, civic citizens, and unlawful entrants.
Political authority attaches only to civic citizens except as expressly authorized by this Constitution.

(e) Exclusivity of Status.
No person shall be assigned to any legal or political status other than those listed in subsection (d).
No agency, court, or statute may create intermediate, hybrid, provisional, or alternative classes of political personhood.

(f) Protection of Minors.
No labor, training, volunteer work, apprenticeship, military program, or institutional participation undertaken before eighteen (18) years of age may be credited toward Civic Citizenship, Civic Standing, political eligibility, or officeholding thresholds.

(g) Civic Standing / Civic Multiplier.
“Civic Standing” (also referred to in prior drafts as a “Civic Multiplier”) means a verified civic weight used only for political authority as defined in this Article.
Civic Standing does not determine personhood, dignity, civil rights, or human worth.

(h) Political Authority Reserved.
No voting right, office-holding right, initiative power, or binding political authority may be exercised by any person who is not a Civic Citizen, unless expressly authorized by this Constitution.
Administrative, consultative, or advisory participation shall not be construed as political power.

All persons lawfully residing within the Republic shall enjoy inalienable rights as expressed in this Constitution, regardless of civic status, including:
freedom of speech, thought, conscience, religion, and assembly;
protection from arbitrary search, seizure, or deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process;
the right to fair trial, legal representation, and equal protection under law;
freedom of movement, occupation, contract, and private property ownership; and
access to emergency medical care, basic education for minors, and public safety services.

These rights shall not be abridged except where necessary to protect the rights of others, or as otherwise authorized under strict due process.

Civic Standing constitutes a political trust and office of governance, not a classification of personhood, civil worth, or human dignity.

(a) Standard of Restriction.
No right listed in this Section may be limited or burdened except by:
(1) individualized judicial order;
(2) based on clear and convincing evidence;
(3) of imminent and specific harm; and
(4) using the least restrictive means.
Generalized public safety, administrative convenience, or group status shall not suffice.

(b) Prohibition on Collective or Status-Based Deprivation.
No lawful resident shall lose or have diminished civil rights on the basis of citizenship status, immigration category, economic condition, race, belief, or political view.
Only individualized criminal conviction or judicial incapacity may justify restriction.

Any finding of persistent criminality or irredeemable danger shall comply fully with Article II, including due process, evidence standards, right to counsel, and periodic review.

(a) Non-Civic Status.

(a) Personhood and Protection.
A person born within the jurisdiction of the Republic shall possess legal personhood and full protection of law.

Any person lawfully present in the Republic from childhood shall have full access to the lawful pathways toward Civic Citizenship upon reaching adulthood. No person raised within the Republic may be permanently barred from earning Civic Citizenship absent disqualifying conduct under this Constitution.

No classification of birth status shall affect legal personhood, human dignity, civil rights, or equal protection of the laws.

The Civic Competence Exam is the gateway to the franchise.

Every lawful resident who satisfies the lawful prerequisites for Civic Citizenship established by this Article, and who passes the Civic Competence Exam, shall be recognized as a Civic Citizen for purposes of voting and shall receive a base 1× Civic Standing.

(b) Exam Effects Limited.
Passage of the exam shall not, by itself, grant eligibility for public office unless this Article expressly provides otherwise.

(c) Administration, Security, and Anti-Capture.
Administration, security, transparency, appeals, and anti-capture safeguards for the exam are are governed by Article III-A and Article 0-B, and shall be construed to prevent factional manipulation, credential laundering, or administrative expansion of the electorate.
(d) Minimum Residency Prerequisite.
An applicant must have maintained continuous lawful residency within the Republic for no less than five (5) years immediately preceding application.
Law may provide narrowly tailored modifications only where required by military necessity or for persons born within the Republic to Civic Citizen parents, provided no such modification creates elite exemption or unequal civic standing.

(e) Civic Education and Oath Requirement.
An applicant must complete civic education covering the Constitution, the history of the Republic, the structure and limits of government, and the duties of citizenship, and must swear a public oath of allegiance affirming loyalty to the Republic and its constitutional order.
The oath shall be binding and enforceable as a condition of Civic Citizenship.

(f) Retesting.
Retests shall occur every twenty (20) years unless otherwise specified by this Constitution.
Retakes shall be unlimited.
Any fee shall be limited to cost and waived for indigent applicants.
(g) Mandatory Grant Upon Qualification; No Added Requirements.
Where an applicant has met all constitutional requirements, the administering authority shall recognize Civic Citizenship and the baseline 1× Civic Standing.
No administering authority may impose requirements beyond those expressly enumerated in this Article, and any such attempt is void.
Failure or refusal to grant recognition upon qualification constitutes a constitutional violation subject to judicial compulsion and damages.

No person shall be judged, favored, or disqualified based on religion, political belief, ideology, speech, or lawful association.
Only conduct, verified contribution, competence (as expressly defined), and constitutional loyalty may be evaluated.
(f) Verifiable, Sustained, Non-Trivial.
The Republic shall award additional Civic Standing credit only for contributions that are verifiable, sustained, and non-trivial.

(g) Anti-Gaming Rules.
No nominal participation, shell service, purchased certifications, proxy-crediting, or coordinated fraud may generate Civic Standing.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission (CJC) shall audit claims.
Intentional falsification, proxy-crediting, or bribery to obtain Civic Standing constitutes a disqualifying offense, triggers revocation, and constitutes at minimum a Tier-II offense where so classified by Article II and implementing law.
