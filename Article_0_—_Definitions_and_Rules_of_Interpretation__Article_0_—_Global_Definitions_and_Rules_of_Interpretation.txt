The protections of this Section shall not be suspended, waived, or bypassed by emergency declaration, judicial rule, or legislative act, except by constitutional amendment consistent with Article XV.

Section 4. Popular Override of Law and Judicial Doctrine
4.1 Ultimate Popular Authority
Civic Citizens retain the ultimate authority to approve, nullify, override, or restore governmental action taken under this Constitution, including statutes, regulations, and binding judicial holdings or doctrines, subject to the procedural safeguards herein and the lock protections of Article XV.

No court or agency is required to submit any matter to referendum. Referenda occur only upon citizen initiation as provided herein.

4.1A Constitutional Boundary (No Amendment by Override)

No citizen-initiated override under this Section may amend, suspend, repeal, unlock, lock, reinterpret, or otherwise alter the text, structure, or legal effect of this Constitution.

Any petition whose legal effect would directly alter constitutional text, constitutional structure, or lock-protected operation shall be treated as a proposed constitutional amendment or unlocking measure and must proceed exclusively under Article XV, including any heightened thresholds required for unlocking.

4.2 Single-Issue Requirement

Any citizen-initiated override petition shall address one discrete governmental action or legal question only, stated plainly and without aggregation, conditional language, or bundled demands.

A petition that combines multiple actions, policies, or grievances shall be invalid.4.3 Threshold for InitiationA binding popular review may be triggered only upon petition by not less than twenty percent (20%) of Civic Citizens, verified within a fixed statutory period.

4.4 Cooling-Off and Anti-Spam Limitation
No substantially identical petition concerning the same governmental action may be initiated more than once within a defined cooling-off period following a failed referendum or judicial resolution.

The cooling-off period shall be one hundred eighty (180) days, unless the petitioners demonstrate a material change in facts or circumstances occurring after the prior vote or resolution.

A material change includes, but is not limited to:

a. disclosure of previously classified or concealed information;

b. evidence of fraud, misrepresentation, or bad-faith justification by public officials;

c. expansion, prolongation, or material escalation of the challenged action;

d. substantial deviation between stated objectives and actual conduct or outcomes;

e. significant new harm to life, liberty, or national interest not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the prior vote.

The certification authority shall make a threshold determination of material change solely as to form and sufficiency, not political merit.
Mere changes in public opinion, absent new facts or circumstances, shall not constitute material change.

4.5 Amendment-Grade Procedural Safeguards (Form and Disclosure)

All override petitions and referenda under this Section shall satisfy the amendment-grade safeguards of Article XV concerning:
(1) single-subject form;
(2) a plain-language explanation of purpose and effect;
(3) disclosure of all affected provisions, rules, tests, or doctrines; and
(4) public deliberation safeguards.

These safeguards apply regardless of whether the override affects statutory law, regulation, or judicial doctrine, but shall not be construed to impose constitutional amendment thresholds, state-ratification requirements, or unlocking procedures unless the petition triggers the Constitutional Boundary in Section 4.1A.
4.6 Expedited Review Window; Interim Rule
Upon certification of a valid petition, the matter shall proceed to an expedited, binding referendum within a constitutionally prescribed timeframe.

Pending such referendum, the default-to-liberty provisions of this Article shall govern only as to prospective enforcement or expansion of the challenged action, unless a court finds by clear and convincing evidence that continued enforcement is strictly necessary to prevent imminent and specific harm.

4.7 Outcome and Effect
(a) Ordinary Override Threshold

A referendum under this Section shall be required to meet the Supermajority Rule as defined in Article 0.

No higher threshold applies under this Section unless the petition triggers the Constitutional Boundary in Section 4.1A, in which case the matter proceeds under Article XV (including the unlocking threshold where applicable).
(b) Statutory Override Effect
Upon adoption, the challenged statute or regulation is void and unenforceable to the extent overridden.

(c) Judicial Override Effect
Upon adoption, the challenged judicial holding, doctrine, test, standard of review, or precedent shall have no binding or precedential effect and shall not be relied upon by any court or agency.
Affected cases shall be remanded or re-adjudicated under the remaining law and this Constitution, as applicable.

(d) Lock-Protected Limitation
No override may amend, suspend, repeal, weaken, narrow, reinterpret, or render ineffectual any lock-protected provision except by compliance with Article XV, including any heightened approval thresholds required by Article XV for lock-protected change.

4.8 Protection Against Harassment of Review Bodies
No court, commission, or review body shall be required to entertain repetitive, bad-faith, or procedurally defective citizen petitions designed primarily to obstruct governance or exhaust institutional capacity.
Certification authorities may summarily reject petitions that fail to meet the requirements of this Section.
Section 5. Conditional Provisions, Definitions, and Global Interpretive Safeguards

5.1 Conditional and Transitional Clauses

Where this Constitution uses terms such as “during transition,” “phase-in,” “temporary,” “sunset,” “until,” “unless,” or otherwise identifies a provision as time-limited or contingent on a defined condition, such language shall be construed as operative only within the stated scope and duration.

No conditional or transitional clause may be construed to authorize indefinite delay, perpetual “temporary” government, or administrative suspension of constitutional rights.

5.2 Global Principles of Interpretation

Principles of interpretation expressly incorporated by reference from any Article shall apply globally unless expressly overridden.

In cases of genuine ambiguity, delay, deadlock, procedural hold, inaction, or interpretive doubt regarding any provision, power, right, or obligation under this Constitution, interpretation shall favor:
liberty over restraint,
individual rights over administrative convenience,
accountability and transparency over secrecy, and
the sovereignty of the People over the expansion or preservation of governmental authority.

Delay shall not be construed as denial of liberty. No governmental body, officer, or procedure may use inaction, procedural obstruction, or indefinite hold to impair, suspend, or defeat a constitutional right, safeguard, or duly authorized exercise of lawful power.

In cases involving alleged violations of plain-language requirements, ambiguity or complexity shall be construed against the Republic and in favor of liberty and public comprehension, consistent with the In Dubio Pro Libertate principle.

5.3 Definitions, Glossaries, and Supplementation

The Consolidated Defined Terms list in this Article shall be deemed automatically supplemented by any new definitions expressly added to this Article by constitutional amendment.

Statutes may define technical, administrative, or implementing terms for purposes of execution, provided that:
(1) no statutory definition may conflict with this Constitution;
(2) no statutory definition may narrow, expand, manipulate, or redefine any constitutional term in a manner that changes substantive rights, prohibitions, thresholds, caps, floors, or jurisdictional limits;
(3) no statutory definition may introduce “newspeak,” euphemism, or ideological relabeling intended to evade accountability or alter public meaning; and
(4) any statutory definition adopted for general public governance must be written in plain language and recorded by the Public Ministry of Records in a public glossary.

Definitions adopted by statute shall be strictly construed and shall not expand substantive powers, authorities, or limitations beyond those expressly authorized by this Constitution.

5.4 Anti-Paralysis and Anti-Capture Safeguard

No emergency, continuity, necessity, deadlock, or procedural doctrine may suspend, restrict, delay, obstruct, or interfere with the operation of the Constitutional Judicial Commission, or with any constitutional integrity, oversight, anti-capture, or anti-collusion body established by this Constitution.

Any attempt to do so—whether by inaction, pretextual procedural hold, evasion, or indefinite delay—is void ab initio and constitutes grave constitutional malfeasance.

5.5 Duplicate Definitions

Where a definition from this Article is reproduced elsewhere for readability, the reproduced text shall be identical; any conflict is resolved in favor of this Article.
