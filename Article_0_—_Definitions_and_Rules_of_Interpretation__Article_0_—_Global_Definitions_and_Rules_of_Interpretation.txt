Article 0 — Global Definitions and Rules of Interpretation

Section 1. General Rules
Unless the context clearly requires otherwise: 
	•	Terms defined in this Article apply throughout the Constitution. 
	•	Terms defined in specific Articles shall have the meaning given there when used in that Article or in closely related provisions. 
	•	In case of conflict between a general definition and an article-specific definition, the Article-specific definition controls. 
	•	Words importing the singular include the plural, and vice versa. 
	•	Words importing the masculine include the feminine and neuter. 
	•	The present tense includes the future tense where context permits. 
	•	“Shall” is mandatory; “may” is permissive. 
	•	“Person” includes natural persons, legal entities, and—where contextually appropriate and consistent with Article XXVI—recognized sentient non-human entities. 
	•	Courts shall construe genuine ambiguities in favor of liberty, accountability, transparency, and the sovereignty of the People, consistent with the text, structure, and express purposes of this Constitution, except where a provision explicitly authorizes restraint of power. 
	•	No interpretation shall give effect to evasive structuring, nominal compliance, or formalism designed to defeat constitutional purpose.
	•	No interpretation shall give effect to collusion, tacit coordination, proxy action, or public-private concerted conduct designed to suppress lawful rights, lawful competition, or constitutional accountability; courts shall treat such conduct as constitutionally void, regardless of nominal legality.
