Article XV — Amendments, Lock Clauses, and Anti-Emergency Drift

Charge

This Article establishes the exclusive procedures and requirements by which this Constitution may be amended, corrected, or clarified. All amendment powers shall be exercised openly, deliberately, and in strict conformity with the processes set forth herein, and shall not be expanded or bypassed by emergency, necessity, or convenience. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to permit suspension, alteration, or informal modification of constitutional provisions outside the amendment process expressly authorized by this Constitution.


Legal Text

Section 1. Supremacy of This Article

This Article governs all constitutional amendment, suspension, modification, interpretation, emergency authority, and claims of necessity.

No statute, treaty, executive action, judicial doctrine, regulation, administrative interpretation, or emergency declaration may alter, bypass, suspend, reinterpret, or override this Article.
Any attempt to do so is null and void.
For purposes of this Article, “interpretation” includes judicial doctrine, tests, standards of review, balancing frameworks, and deference regimes.

Section 2. Classes of Constitutional Provisions

The Constitution is composed of three classes of provisions:

a. Unamendable Core Principles
b. Structurally Locked Provisions
c. Generally Amendable Provisions

No provision may be reclassified except through amendment procedures applicable to the higher class.

Section 2A. Recognition of Article-Level Locks
Lock declarations contained within individual Articles of this Constitution are fully valid, self-executing, and of equal force to locks designated by appendix, index, or global classification.

Where an Article declares itself locked or subject to heightened amendment or interpretive constraints, that declaration shall govern the amendment, interpretation, and enforcement of that Article according to its own terms and in harmony with this Article.

No court, authority, or officer may deny effect to an Article-level lock on grounds of placement, form, or location.


Section 3. Unamendable Core Principles (Eternity Clauses)

The following principles are permanent and unamendable and shall not be repealed, suspended, modified, reinterpreted, or overridden by any authority, at any time, for any reason:

a. the supremacy of this Constitution over all other law;
b. the sovereignty of the People as the sole source of political authority;
c. the separation of powers among Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches;
d. the prohibition of hereditary, purchased, corporate, algorithmic, or non-human political authority;
e. the requirement of civic citizenship, earned through service and duty, as a prerequisite for voting and holding public office;
f. the prohibition on suspension of constitutional rights by emergency, decree, necessity, or reinterpretation;
g. the guarantee of due process and equal protection under law;
h. the prohibition of perpetual or rolling emergency powers;
i. the right of lawful resistance to constitutional violations as defined elsewhere in this Constitution;
j. the prohibition on federal coercion of state sovereignty through fiscal dependency, conditional funding, or economic pressure;
k. the prohibition on federal preemption of state law by regulation absent express legislative authorization and constitutional necessity;
l. the right of states to decline participation in non-mandatory federal programs without retaliation or deprivation of unrelated funds;
m. the right of citizens to challenge federal encroachment upon state sovereignty through judicial process;
n. the prohibition on sovereign immunity where the federal government unlawfully intrudes upon powers reserved to the states.
Any act purporting to amend, suspend, or circumvent these principles is void ab initio and constitutes oathbreaking.

o. no private contract, covenant, oath, or obligation may bind any natural person beyond the lifetime of the consenting party, except where expressly authorized by this Constitution. All such obligations expire at death. No contract purporting to bind an individual beyond their natural lifetime shall be enforceable, except where expressly permitted by this Constitution.


Section 4. Structurally Locked Provisions

Structurally locked provisions include, but are not limited to:

a. amendment procedures and thresholds;
b. electoral integrity mechanisms;
c. legislative transparency and integrity requirements;
d. federalism and reserved powers;
e. judicial independence and limits;
f. anti-capture, anti-corruption, and public stewardship requirements;
g. sunset, reauthorization, and outcome-based governance mandates;
h. limitations on federal funding conditions and fiscal coercion of states;
i. limitations on regulatory preemption of state law;
j. program sunset, outcome review, automatic devolution, and state opt-out rights.

These provisions may be amended only through the procedures in Section 6 and may not be altered, suspended, or bypassed during declared emergencies.

Section 5. Generally Amendable Provisions

All constitutional provisions not listed in Sections 3 or 4 are generally amendable, subject to the procedures and safeguards of this Article.

No amendment may contradict, undermine, or indirectly erode unamendable or structurally locked provisions.

Section 6. Amendment Procedures

An amendment, repeal, suspension, correction, clarification, or material reinterpretation of this Constitution may be proposed and adopted only by one of the exclusive methods set forth in Section 20.

Without limiting Section 20, a popular proposal by national civic petition shall meet thresholds defined by law and consistent with Article XXVII.
Such thresholds shall be no lower than ten percent (10%) of Civic Citizens, unless this Constitution expressly provides otherwise.

All proposed amendments shall:
be single-subject;
include a plain-language explanation of purpose and effect;
disclose all affected provisions;
state anticipated risks, tradeoffs, and consequences.

Amendment Thresholds:
Unless this Constitution expressly provides otherwise, any amendment, repeal, suspension, or material reinterpretation of a provision shall require adoption by one of the three methods in Section 20, and shall additionally require:

(a) certification by the Supreme Court that the change does not diminish substantive rights or enforcement mechanisms protected under lock clauses;
(b) independent review by the Constitutional Judicial Commission affirming absence of institutional capture, coercion, or pretextual motivation.

Section 18 governs unlocking lock-protected provisions, including the applicable supermajority threshold and safeguards for unlocking.

Section 7. Temporal Safeguards

No amendment may be:

a. introduced, voted upon, or ratified during a declared national emergency;
b. fast-tracked, bundled, or exempted from public review;
c. applied retroactively to immunize wrongdoing or shield prior violations.

A minimum public deliberation period of ninety (90) days shall apply to all amendments.
No temporary, provisional, pilot, sunset-based, or experimental measure may bypass or suspend constitutional requirements.

Section 8. Prohibition on Emergency Constitutional Alteration

No emergency, war, disaster, economic crisis, public health threat, or security concern shall justify:

a. suspension of constitutional rights;
b. alteration of amendment procedures;
c. concentration of power beyond constitutional limits;
d. reinterpretation of this Constitution to expand authority.

Emergency powers may coordinate action, not rewrite law.

Section 8A. Emergency Coordination Without Constitutional Displacement

In cases of declared national emergency, including invasion, insurrection, or catastrophic disaster, the federal government may exercise temporary coordinating authority solely for the purpose of resource alignment and intergovernmental cooperation.

Such authority is permitted only where:

a. approval by a sixty percent (60%) vote of both legislative houses;
b. limited to coordination, not command or displacement of state law;
c. does not suspend constitutional rights or alter constitutional structure;
d. expires automatically after ninety (90) days unless renewed by identical vote;
e. is subject to immediate and non-deferential judicial review.

Emergency authority shall not create precedent, implied power, or interpretive expansion.

Section 9. Automatic Rollback of Emergency Authority

All emergency powers shall:

a. be expressly enumerated by statute;
b. be narrowly tailored;
c. expire automatically without renewal.

Upon expiration, all actions taken under emergency authority shall revert to constitutional baseline.

No emergency power may create precedent.

Section 10. Judicial Review and Burden of Proof

All claims of emergency necessity, constitutional reinterpretation, implied authority, or federal preemption shall be subject to immediate CRC judicial review without deference.

The burden of proof rests entirely on the authority asserting necessity or supremacy.

Citizens may challenge federal actions that unlawfully undermine legitimate state law or state sovereignty, independent of state participation or consent.

Silence, ambiguity, historical practice, or administrative convenience shall not suffice. Constitutional silence shall not be construed as permission to alter, amend, or reallocate power.

Section 11. Personal Accountability for Abuse

Any official who knowingly:

a. exceeds emergency authority;
b. enforces unconstitutional orders;
c. attempts constitutional alteration outside this Article;
d. conceals, misrepresents, or fabricates emergency justification;

shall be personally liable under law, in addition to removal from office.

No immunity attaches to constitutional violation.

Section 12. Treaty and International Constraint Clause

No treaty, international agreement, compact, or foreign obligation may:

a. amend this Constitution;
b. supersede constitutional rights;
c. bind the Republic beyond the powers granted herein;
d. require coercion of state participation in federal programs;
e. impose regulatory preemption absent constitutional authorization.

Treaties inconsistent with this Constitution are void.

Section 13. Federal–State Program Sunset and Devolution

All federal programs materially affecting state governance, regulatory authority, or fiscal structure shall expire after ten (10) years unless affirmatively reauthorized through the full legislative process.

Each such program shall state explicit, measurable objectives.

Failure to meet stated objectives shall trigger automatic review and presumptive devolution of authority to the states.

No emergency declaration may suspend this requirement.

Section 14. State Exit Rights and Fiscal Rebalancing

States may opt out of participation in federal programs not constitutionally mandatory.

Upon opt-out, the state shall receive a proportional tax rebate or fiscal credit reflecting its contribution, adjusted for shared national obligations.

No opt-out shall result in punitive withholding of unrelated funds, services, or protections.

This right shall not be suspended by statute, regulation, emergency, or treaty.

Section 15. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to:

a. preserve constitutional continuity;
b. prevent erosion by exception;
c. deny legitimacy to fear-based governance;
d. favor liberty, accountability, and restraint over expedience.

The Constitution shall not die quietly.

Section 16. Prohibition on Emergency Circumvention

No declaration of emergency, national security crisis, public health order, economic emergency, invasion, rebellion, martial law, or any other exigency may suspend, waive, limit, or circumvent any provision of this Constitution, including lock-protected rights, due process guarantees, or definitions in Article 0.
Temporary protective measures (e.g., extreme risk protection orders, judicially supervised civil holds) are permissible only when strictly necessary, time-limited, individualized, supported by clear and convincing evidence of an Imminent and Specific Risk (as defined in Article 0), and subject to immediate adversarial review and restoration. Such measures are civil in nature and do not constitute suspension or derogation of constitutional rights.
Any attempt to use emergency authority for permanent structural change, rights erosion, or pretextual coercion (as defined in Article 0) is void ab initio and constitutes a grave offense.

Section 17. Lock-Protected Provisions

Provisions designated as lock-protected (including but not limited to Article II in its entirety, Article III earned civic citizenship, Article XXVI Charter of Inviolable Rights, and all cross-references to definitions in Article 0 that support these Articles) may not be repealed, suspended, weakened, narrowed, reinterpreted, or rendered ineffectual except by the highest procedural threshold above and only for the purpose of clarifying consistency or expanding protections.
New lock designations may be added by constitutional amendment meeting the above requirements, or by legislative act ratified by a seventy-five percent (75%) supermajority of both chambers and signed by the Executive, provided the addition strengthens liberty, accountability, or sovereignty rather than restricting it.
Lock-protected provisions include, but are not limited to, Article XXX (Federal Enforcement Authority, Accountability, and Civic Restraint) in its entirety; Article XXIV (Federal Law Enforcement and the Use of State Force) in its entirety; the separation of intelligence and law enforcement; prohibitions on entrapment and manufactured radicalization; safeguards governing automated integrity monitoring; and the affirmative duty to dissolve corrupt enforcement bodies.
For purposes of this Article, ‘highest procedural threshold’ means: (i) the Section 6 Amendment Thresholds for structurally locked provisions; and (ii) where Section 18 applies, the Section 18 unlocking threshold plus all Section 18 procedural safeguards.
While a provision remains lock-protected, amendments may only clarify consistency or expand protections; any other change requires unlocking under Section 18.

Section 18. Unlocking Lock-Protected Provisions

(a) Purpose and Narrow Construction
Lock-protected provisions exist to prevent short-term passions, capture, or emergency opportunism from weakening core rights, caps, floors, prohibitions, and structural safeguards. Unlocking is permitted, but shall occur only through a heightened process that is insulated from bundling, deception, and procedural laundering.

(b) Methods and No Bypass
Unlocking may be accomplished only by one of the exclusive methods in Section 20, and only upon satisfaction of this Section.
No statute, court, commission, or officer may treat a lock-protected provision as unlocked by interpretation, necessity, “balancing,” implied power, emergency, or administrative convenience.

(c) Single-Subject and Explicit Targeting
An unlocking measure must identify, by citation, the exact lock-protected provision(s) to be unlocked and shall address no other subject. Any measure that bundles unlocking with unrelated policy change, appropriations, or institutional re-structuring is void.

(d) Plain-Language and Disclosure Requirements
Any unlocking measure must satisfy amendment-grade safeguards, including:
(1) a plain-language explanation of purpose and legal effect;
(2) a redline-style disclosure of the exact textual change(s) to the lock status and any intended amendment text if paired under subsection (i);
(3) a disclosure of all provisions whose operation would be altered directly or by necessary implication; and
(4) a public posting period sufficient for review, as specified by law consistent with this Constitution.

(e) Petition Gate
Where unlocking proceeds by national referendum, no unlocking measure may be placed on the ballot absent a petition threshold of not less than twenty percent (20%) of Civic Citizens, verified within a fixed statutory period.

(f) Cooling-Off and Anti-Spam
No substantially similar unlocking measure concerning the same lock-protected provision(s) may be initiated more than once within one hundred eighty (180) days following a failed vote, absent material change as defined in Article 0, Section 4.4.

(g) Approval Threshold
Unlocking a lock-protected provision requires approval by not less than seventy percent (70%) of the deciding body under the chosen method in Section 20, and no lesser threshold shall suffice.

(h) Turnout Floor (Anti-Low-Turnout Capture)
No unlocking referendum shall be valid unless participation meets a minimum turnout floor established by this Constitution or by national law enacted pursuant to it, which shall be set high enough to prevent factional capture through low-participation elections.

(i) Unlock-and-Amend, or Unlock-Only
An unlocking measure may be presented as:
(1) Unlock-only: removing lock protection while leaving the text otherwise unchanged; or
(2) Unlock-and-amend: unlocking and adopting a specific amendment text simultaneously.
Where presented as unlock-and-amend, both the unlocking and the amendment text must satisfy all requirements of this Section, including the single-subject rule and the seventy percent (70%) threshold.

(j) Certification for Form and Honesty (Not Merit)
Prior to ballot placement (or, where applicable, prior to final adoption), the CJC and the CRC shall certify only:
(1) single-subject compliance;
(2) plain-language sufficiency and accurate disclosure of legal effect; and
(3) absence of procedural laundering, deception, or hidden alteration of caps, floors, prohibitions, or jurisdictional limits.
Neither body may veto an unlocking measure based on policy disagreement.

(k) Timing Restrictions
No unlocking referendum may be conducted during a declared emergency or within a constitutionally defined cooling period after an emergency, as specified by law consistent with this Constitution.

(l) Effect of Successful Unlock
Upon successful unlock, the provision remains fully operative but becomes amendable under the ordinary amendment rules of this Constitution, except as otherwise restricted herein. Any subsequent amendment must still comply with all applicable rights protections, due process constraints, and anti-capture safeguards.
Unlocking measures and any paired amendments are subject to the Decennial Reaffirmation and Automatic Reversion requirements of this Article.

Section 19. Decennial Reaffirmation of Amendments; Automatic Reversion

(a) Provisional Adoption; Required Reaffirmation; Reaffirmation Window
Every constitutional amendment adopted under this Article shall remain subject to a mandatory reaffirmation referendum conducted during the tenth (10th) year after the amendment’s effective date, within a fixed window defined by law.

If the reaffirmation referendum is not conducted within that window, the amendment automatically reverts at the close of the window as though it failed reaffirmation.

(b) Reaffirmation Threshold
An amendment shall become permanent only if reaffirmed by a simple majority (50% + 1) of participating Civic Citizens in the reaffirmation referendum.

(c) Automatic Reversion Upon Failure
If an amendment fails reaffirmation, the Constitution shall automatically revert to the text and legal effect that existed immediately prior to that amendment, effective upon certification of the referendum result.
No further legislative or judicial act shall be required to restore the prior text.

(d) Ballot Clarity
The reaffirmation ballot shall present the amendment as adopted and shall ask, in plain language, whether the People reaffirm it to remain in force.
No reaffirmation ballot may bundle multiple amendments.

(e) Single Reaffirmation
An amendment reaffirmed under this Section shall thereafter remain in force unless amended or repealed pursuant to this Article. No further periodic reaffirmation is required.

(f) Savings and Stability
Reversion under this Section shall not:
(1) void final judgments entered while the amendment was in force, absent independent constitutional defect or fraud;
(2) impair vested private rights lawfully accrued in reliance on the amendment, where such impairment would violate due process; or
(3) invalidate completed governmental acts that were lawful when performed;
provided that all ongoing enforcement, future legal standards, and prospective governmental actions shall conform to the restored constitutional text upon reversion.

(g) Application to Unlocking
An unlocking measure, whether unlock-only or unlock-and-amend, constitutes a constitutional alteration for purposes of this Section and shall be subject to reaffirmation and potential reversion on the same terms.

Section 20. Methods of Constitutional Amendment, Repeal, Locking, and Unlocking

(a) Exclusive Methods
This Constitution may be amended, repealed, locked, or unlocked only by one of the following three methods:

(1) Legislative Supermajority Method.
Approval by a supermajority vote of both legislative houses as defined by the Supermajority Rule, together with all certifications and procedural safeguards required by this Constitution for the category of change sought.

(2) Convention of the States Method.
Approval by a Convention of the States conducted under this Constitution, requiring concurrence of not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the States, together with all certifications and procedural safeguards required by this Constitution for the category of change sought.

(3) Popular Supermajority Method.
Approval by national referendum of Civic Citizens, requiring a supermajority vote as defined by the Supermajority Rule; provided that any measure whose purpose includes Unlocking under Section 18 shall require the unlocking threshold of Section 18(g).

(b) Equal Validity
Any method listed in subsection (a) is sufficient to enact constitutional change without requiring approval by the other methods, except where this Constitution expressly provides otherwise for unamendable provisions.

(c) Single-Subject and Plain-Language Safeguards
All measures under any method shall comply with single-subject form, plain-language requirements, and disclosure of legal effect, and shall be void if adopted through bundling, deception, or procedural laundering.

Section 21. Lock Designation
This Article (including all lock designation procedures, anti-emergency rules, and supermajority thresholds) is itself lock-protected and may not be amended except by the highest procedural threshold and certification of non-diminishment.
