Article 0-A — General Prohibition of Collusion and Coordinated Suppression

Charge

This Article prohibits collusion, coordination, or concerted action between public authority and private power that undermines constitutional rights, lawful competition, civic participation, or the public interest.
It applies to all branches, agencies, officers, contractors, and delegated authorities, without exception.

⸻

Section 1. Prohibited Collusion

No public actor shall knowingly coordinate with any private entity to:
	1.	suppress lawful speech, expression, or communication;
	2.	suppress lawful competition, innovation, or market entry;
	3.	block or delay lawful derivative creation, replication, or repair;
	4.	evade, dilute, or selectively enforce constitutional or statutory obligations;
	5.	manufacture consent, compliance narratives, or procedural barriers that defeat constitutional rights.

Collusion may be express or tacit and need not be formalized to be unlawful.

⸻

Section 2. Participation by Private Power

No private entity may solicit, induce, or participate in collusive arrangements prohibited by this Article.

Private compliance with unconstitutional coordination shall not confer immunity.

⸻

Section 3. Presumptions and Burden of Proof

Collusion shall be presumed where:
	1.	parallel public and private actions produce coordinated suppression;
	2.	communications, incentives, or benefits align public decisions with private advantage;
	3.	enforcement patterns favor specific private actors absent neutral justification.

Upon such a showing, the burden shall shift to the participating parties to demonstrate independent and lawful action.

⸻

Section 4. Remedies and Consequences

Acts of collusion are void.

Remedies and consequences may include:
	1.	injunctive relief;
	2.	invalidation of resulting rules, agreements, or enforcement actions;
	3.	civil and criminal liability;
	4.	loss of public office, licenses, or contracting eligibility.

Standing to challenge violations of this Article shall be broad.

⸻

Section 5. Relationship to Other Provisions

This Article operates in addition to, and not in limitation of:
	•	Article XI (Transparency and Anti-Capture);
	•	Article X (Commons, Technology, and Intellectual Property);
	•	Article XXX (Enforcement Authority);
	•	Article XLII (Communication Freedom).

Where overlap exists, the most restrictive applicable anti-collusion rule shall control.

⸻

Section 6. Construction and Lock Scope

This Article shall be construed broadly against coordinated suppression and narrowly against claims of administrative necessity, efficiency, or partnership.

The prohibition of collusion established by this Article is structural and non-derogable and shall not be suspended, waived, or circumvented by statute, regulation, emergency declaration, or contract.
