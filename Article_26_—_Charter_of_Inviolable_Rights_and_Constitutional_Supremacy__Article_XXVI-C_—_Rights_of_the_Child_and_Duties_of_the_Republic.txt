Article XXVI-C — Rights of the Child and Duties of the Republic

Charge:
The purpose of this Article is to establish enforceable constitutional protections for children against abuse, exploitation, neglect, and institutional misconduct, while preserving the fundamental rights and responsibilities of parents and families.

This Article creates a fiduciary duty in the Republic to act as guardian of last resort when, and only when, clear and convincing evidence demonstrates actual or imminent harm to a child.

No public or private institution, religious body, ideology, or economic interest may override the rights of the child or the evidentiary standards and procedural safeguards set forth herein.

This preserves your hard-line anti-abuse stance without creating a “the state owns children” loophole.

Section 1. Inherent Rights of the Child

Every child possesses inviolable rights to:

(a) bodily integrity and safety;
(b) freedom from abuse, exploitation, trafficking, and coercion;
(c) stable and continuous care;
(d) education sufficient to participate in civic life;
(e) protection from ideological, sexual, or psychological exploitation;
(f) truthful process when their welfare is at issue.

These rights exist independent of parental status, citizenship, culture, or belief.

⸻

Section 2. Supremacy of Child Protection

The welfare of the child shall prevail over:
	•	parental authority,
	•	institutional authority,
	•	religious authority,
	•	cultural practice,
	•	economic interest,
	•	political ideology.

No custom, belief system, or organizational loyalty may excuse harm.

⸻

Section 3. Evidentiary Standards

Removal, restriction, or override of parental or custodial authority shall occur only upon:
	•	clear and convincing evidence of actual or imminent harm,
	•	based on material facts, not narrative, ideology, or speculation.

Psychological theory, therapeutic ideology, or speculative risk models shall not substitute for evidence of actual or imminent harm.

All removals or restrictions under this Section shall be subject to review by the Constitutional Review Court upon petition by the child, a parent, or an advocate.

⸻

Section 4. Presumption of Parental Fitness

Parents are presumed fit to direct their child’s upbringing absent clear and convincing evidence of harm.

Disagreement with educational, religious, moral, or cultural choices shall not constitute abuse.

⸻

Section 5. Prohibition of Institutional Abuse

Abuse committed by persons or entities holding authority over children — including clergy, religious bodies, cults, schools, teachers, medical providers, foster systems, residential facilities, or government agencies — constitutes systemic abuse.

Systemic abuse is a Tier-Three constitutional offense, regardless of claimed benevolent intent.

⸻

Section 6. Religious and Cultural Cover Prohibited

No religious belief, cultural practice, spiritual authority, or doctrinal claim shall be used to:
	•	shield abuse,
	•	suppress reporting,
	•	coerce silence,
	•	or justify harm.

Religious freedom protects belief — not exploitation.

⸻

Section 7. Child Voice and Standing

A child has the right to be heard in any proceeding affecting their custody, safety, or welfare.

Independent advocates shall be provided where interests conflict.

No child shall be silenced for the comfort of adults or institutions.

⸻

Section 8. Foster Care and State Intervention Limits

State removal shall be temporary, goal-directed, and subject to strict timelines.

The objective shall be safe reunification or permanent placement, not prolonged custodial drift.

No child may be warehoused in institutional limbo.

⸻

Section 9. Prohibition on Profiteering

No public or private entity may receive funding, bonuses, or compensation based on the number of children removed, placed, retained, medicated, or institutionalized.

Child protection shall never be an economic industry.

⸻

Section 10. Adoption and Guardianship

Adoption and guardianship exist to secure permanent stability for children — not to supply markets.

All placements must prioritize continuity, safety, and long-term wellbeing.

⸻

Section 11. Liability of Officials

Any official, therapist, social worker, judge, or administrator who:
	•	fabricates evidence,
	•	suppresses exculpatory information,
	•	or acts from ideological or financial motive

commits constitutional misconduct and shall be personally liable.
The Constitutional Judicial Commission shall have standing to investigate systemic abuse, fabricated evidence, ideological enforcement, or financial motive within child-protection systems and may petition the Constitutional Review Court for relief, sanctions, or institutional dissolution.
⸻

Section 12. Judicial Restraint

Courts shall resolve all ambiguities in favor of:
	•	family integrity,
	•	child stability,
	•	and factual evidence.

Narrative substitution, ideological balancing, or speculative harm doctrines are prohibited.

⸻

Section 13. No Statute of Limitations

Crimes of child abuse, exploitation, or trafficking shall have no statute of limitations.

⸻

Section 14. Construction

This Article shall be construed to protect children without transforming the state into a parent.

The Republic is a guardian of last resort — not a family.

⸻

Section 15. Lock Protection

Pursuant to Article XV, this Article is LOCK-PROTECTED.

No statute, regulation, judicial doctrine, treaty, or emergency power may:
	•	weaken child protections,
	•	expand institutional authority over families,
	•	restore religious or cultural immunity,
	•	dilute evidentiary standards,
	•	or create financial incentives for removal.

Any attempt to do so is void.
