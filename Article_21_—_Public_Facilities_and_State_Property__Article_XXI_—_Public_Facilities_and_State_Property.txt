Article XXI — Public Facilities and State Property
Charge 
The State holds public land and facilities in trust for the People—not as sovereign landlord, prestige project, or instrument of elite comfort. Accumulation, degradation, secrecy, or luxury in public property betrays stewardship and erodes legitimacy. This Article restrains state ownership to what is strictly necessary, proportionate, transparent, durable, and humane, while forbidding the use of public assets for privilege, concealment, or symbolic domination.
Section 1. Principle of Proportional Stewardship Public land, buildings, and facilities shall be acquired, retained, used, or disposed of solely for legitimate, demonstrable public purposes and in strict proportion to actual need. The State shall not: (a) accumulate or retain land, structures, or complexes grossly disproportionate to their lawful function or public benefit; (b) engage in speculative land banking, indefinite reservation, or acquisition “for future need” absent clear, evidence-based justification, legislative authorization, and periodic judicial review. Unused, excess, or unnecessary public property shall be disposed of, repurposed, or returned to private ownership consistent with law and public interest.
Section 2. Fitness, Safety, Human Dignity, and Durability All public facilities used for education, detention, adjudication, health care, administration, or public service shall meet baseline standards of safety, habitability, sanitation, and human dignity appropriate to their function. The Republic shall prioritize construction, renovation, and maintenance of durable, long-lived facilities designed for generational service using robust engineering and materials suited to resilience and civic permanence. Substandard, degrading, hazardous, or inhumane conditions shall not be justified by budget, convenience, emergency designation, or temporary status. No public function shall be conducted in facilities unfit for the humane treatment of persons subject to their use.
Section 3. Strict Prohibition of Luxury, Privilege, and Elite Use Public property and facilities shall not confer luxury, elite living conditions, personal privilege, status symbolism, or undue comfort upon officials, agents, contractors, or affiliates of the State. Residences, retreats, compounds, secure dwellings, protected offices, or other facilities maintained at public expense shall be limited to the minimum reasonably necessary for lawful public function and verifiable physical safety. Such facilities shall not resemble private estates, instruments of enrichment, vacation properties, or status rewards. Any claim of “security” or “operational necessity” justifying enhanced conditions shall be narrowly construed and subject to independent judicial review.
Section 4. Limits on Acquisition and Retention Acquisition or retention of public land or facilities beyond demonstrated operational need requires: (a) public justification supported by evidence; (b) legislative authorization; (c) periodic review every five (5) years. Excess or underutilized property shall be subject to disposition or repurposing; indefinite retention without active use constitutes waste and breach of stewardship.
Section 5. Lawful Use of Prison Labor for Public Works The use of lawfully convicted persons for public works is constitutionally permitted where it serves genuine public benefit and is consistent with human dignity, proportionality, and Article VII. Permitted labor includes: (a) construction, repair, renovation, and maintenance of durable public infrastructure and facilities; (b) disaster recovery, environmental remediation, and preservation of culturally or historically significant structures.
Such labor shall be: (a) real, productive, and contributing measurable public value; (b) subject to humane standards of safety, medical care, nutrition, rest, and proportionality; (c) governed by law with judicial oversight and periodic review.
Prison labor shall not be used for luxury projects, private enrichment, symbolic punishment, or conditions designed solely to inflict hardship without public benefit.
Section 6. Reuse and Recommissioning The Republic shall favor reopening, reusing, or recommissioning existing public facilities where they: (a) remain structurally viable or can be restored at reasonable cost; (b) meet current standards of safety, containment, habitability, and human dignity; (c) serve a legitimate public purpose. Reuse and restoration shall take precedence over new construction when consistent with stewardship, cost-effectiveness, and humane standards.
Section 6a. Temporary and Transitional Facilities Temporary or transitional facilities (modular structures, trailers, tents, or provisional housing) may be used only where reasonably necessary to address genuine emergencies, overcrowding, displacement, infrastructure failure, or rapid public operations. Such facilities shall: (a) meet baseline standards of safety, sanitation, habitability, and human dignity; (b) be strictly time-limited to the period of demonstrated necessity; (c) not serve as a permanent substitute for durable solutions where permanent facilities are reasonably achievable. Temporary designation shall not be used to evade constitutional obligations through neglect, delay, or indefinite extension. All temporary use shall be subject to expedited judicial review upon challenge.
Section 7. Due Process, Transparency, and Citizen Standing All acquisition, retention, use, reuse, or disposition of public land and facilities shall be subject to: (a) public justification and full disclosure of costs, need, and alternatives; (b) legislative authorization where required; (c) judicial review without deference to administrative claims of necessity or security; (d) broad citizen standing to challenge excess, waste, abuse, luxury, secrecy, or unlawful use before the Constitutional Review Court (CRC).
No claim of security, secrecy, continuity, or emergency shall exempt public property from these stewardship requirements.
Section 8. Oversight and Enforcement The Constitutional Judicial Commission (CJC) shall monitor compliance, certify stewardship standards annually, and investigate credible allegations of waste, privilege, or abuse. Violations of this Article constitute grave offenses, enforceable through injunctive relief, disgorgement of misused assets, personal liability for responsible officials, and other remedies as provided by law.
Section 9. Relationship to Other Articles This Article shall be construed in harmony with:
	•	Article VII (Crime, Justice, and Penal Philosophy);
	•	Article VIII series (Economic Structure, Worker Cooperatives, and Stewardship);
	•	Article IX (Land, Homesteading, and Agricultural Duty);
	•	Article XX series (Public Service and Administrative Structure);
	•	Article XXIV (Federal Law Enforcement and Use of State Force);
	•	Article XXXVI (Transition and Discontinuity of Power).
The State’s stewardship duties shall be at least as strict as those imposed upon private persons under Article IX.
Section 10. Construction and Lock Protection This Article shall be interpreted to: (a) restrain accumulation of state property by inertia, prestige, or secrecy; (b) prohibit use of public assets for elite privilege, concealment, or luxury; (c) favor modesty, necessity, transparency, durability, and human dignity over grandeur or domination; (d) permit lawful, productive prison labor for real public works while forbidding abuse or symbolic punishment; (e) prioritize reuse and restoration of existing facilities over unnecessary new construction.
The core principles of proportional stewardship, prohibition of luxury/privilege, humane standards, anti-waste disposition requirements, and citizen standing are lock-protected under Article XV and may not be repealed, suspended, diluted, or reinterpreted except through supermajority procedures.
