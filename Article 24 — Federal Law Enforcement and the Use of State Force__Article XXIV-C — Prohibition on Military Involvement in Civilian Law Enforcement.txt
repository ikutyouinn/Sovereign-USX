Article XXIV-D — Prohibition on Military Involvement in Civilian Law Enforcement
Military forces, including federalized National Guard units, shall not be deployed for ordinary civilian law enforcement or policing activities.
An exception may exist only in cases of invasion or insurrection, and only upon formal certification by the Constitutional Review Court or the Constitutional Judicial Commission.
Any such deployment shall be time-limited, narrowly scoped, publicly disclosed, and subject to immediate and non-deferential judicial review.
Emergency declarations shall not expand, imply, or normalize military involvement in civilian law enforcement.
