Article III-B — Native Peoples, Cultural Preservation, and Integrated Sovereignty

Charge

The Republic recognizes Indigenous peoples as integral to the nation’s heritage and guarantees protection for cultural preservation, stewardship of heritage sites, and secure economic self-administration through ordinary corporate and property law, while maintaining one Constitution, one judiciary, and uniform rule of law.

(Cross-references: Article I §1; Article II; Article XV; Article XVII; Article 0-B.)

Section 1. Equality, Cultural Preservation, and Heritage Stewardship

(a) Indigenous peoples have the right to preserve languages, cultures, heritages, and traditional lands, and shall stand equal under the law.

(b) No permissible dual citizenship shall exist within the territories of the Republic as defined by law.

(c) Indigenous history, artifacts, and archeological sites shall be treated as national treasures. The Republic shall aid in maintenance and protection and shall appoint members of the tribe as stewards of tribal sites and custodial responsibilities.

(d) Native individuals and entities retain the right to practice traditional ceremonies, use sacred plants or materials (consistent with public safety laws), and transmit cultural knowledge, protected under Article II freedoms of religion and expression.

Section 2. Corporate Self-Administration and Land Conversion

(a) Corporate Self-Administration

Indigenous nations, tribes, or recognized peoples may form hereditary or lineage-based corporate entities under national corporate law for the purpose of managing cultural, land, and economic affairs.

Such entities shall possess full legal personality, including the rights to own property, contract, sue and be sued, and engage in commerce, subject to the Constitution and laws of the Republic.

(b) Land Conversion Authority

Tribal trust lands may be converted, in whole or in part, into corporate property owned by such tribal entities, subject to:
1. recorded consent of the governing body of the tribe;
2. environmental and heritage protections;
3. and national property law.

Such land shall thereafter be held, transferred, and developed under ordinary law, without creating separate sovereign jurisdiction.

Section 3. Judiciary, Law Enforcement, and Arbitration Limits

(a) Judicial and Law Enforcement Integration

The Republic shall ensure that courts, prosecutors, and law enforcement are adequately staffed and funded to provide fair, timely, and impartial adjudication of all matters involving tribal lands, corporate entities, and tribal members.

(b) Local Law Enforcement Permitted; Uniform Judiciary Required.

Nothing in this Article prohibits the formation of ordinary municipal, county, or state law-enforcement agencies that may be locally staffed, including predominantly by members of a tribe, provided such agencies operate under the unified constitutional criminal code, procedure, and judiciary of the Republic.

No law-enforcement body may claim separate sovereign criminal jurisdiction or submit cases to a parallel court system.

(c) Arbitration Limits; Consent Required; No Criminal Jurisdiction.

Native corporate entities may establish internal arbitration for minor disputes, but all decisions are appealable to Republic courts and must comply with due process (Article II).

Internal arbitration may be used only for civil disputes between:

(1) two or more members or beneficiaries of the tribal corporate entity; or

(2) the tribal corporate entity and a non-member party who has expressly consented in a written arbitration agreement.

No arbitration forum may exercise criminal jurisdiction, compel participation absent consent, or restrict access to Republic courts for constitutional claims, injunctive relief, or due process review.

Section 4. No Sovereign Carve-Outs; Uniform Rule of Law

(a) No Sovereign Carve-Outs

Nothing in this Section shall be construed to create:
1. dual citizenship,
2. territorial apartheid,
3. independent criminal or civil jurisdiction,
4. or exemption from constitutional law.

All persons and entities remain subject to the same Constitution.

Section 5. Grandfathered Tribal Enterprises and Protection Against Predation

(a) Grandfathered Tribal Enterprises

All lawfully existing tribal enterprises, including casinos, gaming operations, hospitality venues, resorts, liquor operations, entertainment properties, and other commercial undertakings operated by or for the benefit of Indigenous peoples as of the ratification of this Constitution shall be permanently grandfathered.

Such enterprises shall be recognized as vested corporate property of the tribal corporate entities established under Section 2(a) and shall not be:
1. expropriated,
2. nullified,
3. dismantled,
4. or rendered economically nonviable
by any federal, state, or local law.

(b) Protection Against Regulatory or Tax Seizure

No government entity may target, suppress, or appropriate the economic value of grandfathered tribal enterprises through:
1. discriminatory taxation,
2. special fees,
3. licensing schemes,
4. zoning,
5. alcohol or gaming regulation,
6. or indirect economic strangulation.

Such actions shall be treated as unconstitutional takings requiring full restitution and damages.

(c) Protection of Tribal Inheritance

Grandfathered tribal enterprises may not be sold, transferred, leased, licensed, or conveyed to any non-tribal entity or to another tribe without approval by a recorded majority vote of the financial beneficiaries of that enterprise.

No sale, merger, or conversion may be compelled by any government.

(d) No Automatic Expansion Rights

Nothing in this Section grants any person or group the right to establish new gaming, liquor, or restricted enterprises except as permitted by general law applicable to all persons.

Grandfathering protects existing tribal enterprises only.

(e) Anti-Predatory Contract Protection

Any contract, loan, bond, derivative, concession, management agreement, or financial instrument encumbering grandfathered tribal enterprises shall be void if it:
1. grants effective control to a non-tribal party;
2. transfers profit streams without fair market compensation;
3. imposes compounding debt designed to trigger default;
4. or circumvents Section 5(c) through financial engineering.

(f) Beneficiary Governance

All revenues from grandfathered tribal enterprises shall be distributed or administered for the benefit of the recognized tribal beneficiaries.

The identities of beneficiaries, revenue distributions, and major expenditures shall be recorded and subject to audit and judicial review.

No governing council, executive, or trustee may appropriate tribal wealth for private enrichment.

Section 6. Tribal Corporate Property, Housing, Access Control, and Protection From Backdoor Seizure

(a) Absolute Protection from Expropriation

No tribal corporate land, enterprise, or asset may be taken by eminent domain, redevelopment authority, public–private partnership, or any other forced transfer.

Such property shall be treated as inviolable private property under Article II.

(b) Access Control on Tribal Corporate Land

However, this does not bar tribal corporations from barring entry to tribal corporate land for criminal causes, or from barring non-tribal persons from attending culturally sensitive rituals or tribal corporate townhall meetings.

(c) Protection Against Tax-Lien Seizure and Foreclosure

No government entity may seize, foreclose upon, auction, or transfer any tribal corporate land, housing, or other tribal corporate property through:
1. property-tax lien foreclosure,
2. special assessments,
3. code-enforcement liens,
4. utility liens,
5. administrative fines converted into liens,
6. tax-sale assignments to private actors,
7. or any substantially similar mechanism of indirect transfer.

All such mechanisms shall be treated as unconstitutional takings and void as applied to tribal corporate property.

(d) Taxation Rule; Neutrality and Non-Targeting

Tribal corporate property shall not be subjected to any discriminatory taxation, special fee, assessment, or regulatory charge that targets tribal ownership or functionally impairs continued possession.

Where any general tax regime applies, it must be:
1. generally applicable and viewpoint-neutral,
2. uniform in rate and assessment method,
3. non-punitive and non-confiscatory in effect, and
4. subject to judicial review, with the burden on the government to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the tax or assessment is not a disguised taking.

State and local ad valorem property taxes shall not attach to tribal corporate land or to beneficiary housing held on tribal corporate land, absent a properly approved agreement between the governing body concerned and the tribal corporation.

(e) Primary Housing Security for Lawful Beneficiaries

Housing held by tribal corporate entities for the use of lawful tribal beneficiaries, and housing held by lawful beneficiaries on tribal corporate land pursuant to tribal corporate title or recorded use-right, shall be protected against forced sale, lien-engineering, and predatory encumbrance.

No transfer of such housing may occur absent:
1. a final judicial judgment in the constitutional judiciary,
2. full due process and right to counsel,
3. and proof that no narrower remedy can satisfy a lawful obligation without loss of the home.

Section 7. Enforcement, Standing, and Remedies

(a) Any Native individual or entity alleging violations has broad standing to sue in CRC (pursuant to Article 0-B routing), with expedited review.

(b) Remedies include injunctions, damages, and restitution.

Section 8. Lock Protection

This Article is lock-protected under Article XV.

Amendments require the supermajority thresholds required by Article XV, CRC/CJC certification as required by Article 0-B and Article XV, and popular ratification as required by this Constitution.
