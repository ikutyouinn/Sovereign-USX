Article VI-F — Artificial Intelligence in the Judiciary

Section 1. Subordination of Artificial Intelligence to Judicial Authority

No artificial system shall exercise judicial power, discretion, or authority.

No party shall be compelled to accept algorithmic assessment as a substitute for human adjudication.

Section 5. Opt-Out and Human Review

Where artificial systems are used in advisory capacities affecting case processing, any party may request human-only review.

Judges shall independently evaluate all outputs and shall not defer to algorithmic recommendations.

⸻

Section 6. Auditability and Transparency

All artificial systems deployed within the Judiciary shall be:
	1.	auditable;
	2.	documented;
	3.	subject to inspection for constitutional compliance.

No proprietary, opaque, or undisclosed system essential to adjudication may be used.

Judicial reliance on uninspectable “black box” systems is prohibited.

Section 7. Judicial Artificial Intelligence Oversight Office

A Judicial Artificial Intelligence Review Office (CAIRO–Judicial) shall operate within the oversight framework established under Article XII.

The Office shall:
	1.	audit judicial AI systems for compliance;
	2.	investigate violations;
	3.	publish regular public reports;
	4.	refer misconduct for discipline under Article VI-D.

The Office shall possess no adjudicatory authority.

Section 8. Records and Preservation

All records relating to the procurement, deployment, training, configuration, and use of artificial systems in the Judiciary shall constitute public records.

Such records shall be preserved and made accessible pursuant to Article VI-E and Article XXXIX.

Section 9. Emergency Prohibition

No emergency, efficiency rationale, or workload justification shall authorize artificial systems to exercise prohibited judicial functions.

The Judiciary shall not claim exemption from Article XII except where this Constitution expressly provides otherwise.

Section 12. Interpretation

This Subarticle shall be interpreted to ensure that justice remains a human moral act, that machines do not replace judgment in matters of liberty and rights, and that technology serves the courts without governing them.
