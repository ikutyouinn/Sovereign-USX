Article XVI — Elections and Democratic Legitimacy

Charge

This Article establishes constitutional requirements governing elections and the democratic legitimacy of public authority within the Republic. All electoral processes shall be conducted transparently, securely, and verifiably, and shall be designed to ensure accurate expression of voter intent, equal participation, and public confidence in electoral outcomes. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to authorize electoral manipulation, unreviewable procedures, or the exercise of governmental authority absent lawful and credible elections.
Legal Text

Section 1. Authority Over Elections

a. Source of Authority

The authority to conduct elections arises from the People and is exercised through the States, subject to this Constitution. Elections are a public trust, not a partisan instrument.

b. Hybrid Administration Model

Elections shall be administered by the States within a uniform constitutional framework established by the Republic to ensure fairness, security, and equal protection.
States retain operational control; the Republic retains oversight authority to guarantee constitutional compliance.

c. Federal Standards

Congress shall establish national minimum standards governing:
	•	voter eligibility verification;
	•	ballot integrity and chain of custody;
	•	auditability and recount procedures;
	•	election security against fraud, coercion, and foreign interference;
	•	transparency and public observability.

No State may fall below these standards.

d. Prohibition on Federal Control of Outcomes

Neither Congress nor the Executive may dictate election outcomes, manipulate vote counting, interfere with lawful State administration, or delay elections except as constitutionally authorized.

e. Election Oversight Tribunal

A permanent, independent Election Oversight Tribunal shall:
	•	audit compliance with this Article;
	•	hear procedural challenges;
	•	certify national election integrity;
	•	refer violations for prosecution.

The Tribunal shall consist of nine members, appointed through the Constitutional Judicial Commission (CJC) process defined in Article VI, serving staggered nine-year terms, and shall be subject to institutional-integrity supervision by the CJC and constitutional-compliance review by the Constitutional Review Court (CRC).
f. Transparency Requirement

All election procedures, software specifications, chain-of-custody rules, audit methods, and certification standards shall be public by default.

g. Interpretation

This Section preserves State administration, national legitimacy, voter confidence, and the sovereignty of the People.

Section 2. The Right to Vote

a. Citizenship Requirement

The right to vote is reserved exclusively to Civic Citizens. No legal resident or non-civic person may vote in any election.

d. Right of Resistance

When a government systematically subverts elections, suppresses lawful remedies, and rules without genuine consent—upon a two-thirds declaration by State legislatures convened in constitutional convention or a Supreme Court finding of irreparable constitutional destruction—the People retain the inherent right of resistance, including insurrection, as a last resort.

This right arises only when constitutional order has been destroyed, not merely when outcomes are disputed.

e. Enduring Covenant

Where elections are honest, the Republic endures. Where elections are corrupted, liberty collapses.

f. Interpretation

This Article shall be interpreted to preserve trust between the People and their institutions, recognizing that without trust, law decays into force, and authority into tyranny.
